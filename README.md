# Production specifications
This repository contains the production specifications used by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG) to type rare local gazetteers into full texts. This [digitization project](https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/research/projects/rare-local-gazetteers-harvard-yenching-library-open-access-collection) is a collaboration between MPIWG and the Harvard-Yenching Library.
The specifications here are inspired by other ones developed for a [previous digitization project](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/kthoden/despecs) at MPIWG (see branch `forked-state`).
