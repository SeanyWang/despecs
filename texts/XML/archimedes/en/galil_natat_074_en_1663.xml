<s>It was anſwered me, that that proceeded not from the greater Levity; 
<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1401"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>but from the Figure, large and flat, which not being able to pene­
<lb></lb>trate the Reſiſtance of the Water, is the cauſe that it ſubmergeth not. 
<lb></lb></s><s>I replied, that any piece of Ice, of whatſoever Figure, ſwims upon 
<lb></lb>the Water, a manifeſt ſigne, that its being never ſo flat and broad, 
<lb></lb>hath not any part in its floating: and added, that it was a manifeſt 
<lb></lb>proofe hereof to ſee a piece of Ice of very broad Figure being thruſt 
<lb></lb>to the botome of the Water, ſuddenly return to flote atoppe, which 
<lb></lb>had it been more grave, and had its ſwimming proceeded from its 
<lb></lb>Forme, unable to penetrate the Reſiſtance of the <emph type="italics"></emph>Medium,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> that 
<lb></lb>would be altogether impoſſible; I concluded therefore, that the Figure 
<lb></lb>was in ſort a Cauſe of the Natation or Submerſion of Bodies, 
<lb></lb>but the greater or leſſe Gravity in reſpect of the Water: and there­
<lb></lb>fore all Bodyes heavier than it of what Figure ſoever they be, indiffe­
<lb></lb>rently go to the bottome, and the lighter, though of any figure, float 
<lb></lb>indifferently on the top: and I ſuppoſe that thoſe which hold other­
<lb></lb>wiſe, were induced to that beliefe, by ſeeing how that diverſity 
<lb></lb>of Formes or Figures, greatly altereth the Veloſity, and Tardity 
<lb></lb>of Motion; ſo that Bodies of Figure broad and thin, deſcend 
<lb></lb>far more leaſurely into the Water, than thoſe of a more compacted 
<lb></lb>Figure, though both made of the ſame Matter: by which ſome 
<lb></lb>might be induced to believe that the Dilatation of the Figure might 
<lb></lb>reduce it to ſuch ampleneſſe that it ſhould not only retard but wholly 
<lb></lb>impede and take away the Motion, which I hold to be falſe. </s><s>Upon 
<lb></lb>this Concluſion, in many dayes diſcourſe, was ſpoken much, and 
<lb></lb>many things, and divers Experiments produced, of which your 
<lb></lb>Highneſſe heard, and ſaw ſome, and in this diſcourſe ſhall have 
<lb></lb>all that which hath been produced againſt my Aſſertion, and what 
<lb></lb>hath been ſuggeſted to my thoughts on this matter, and for con­
<lb></lb>firmation of my Concluſion: which if it ſhall ſuffice to remove that 
<lb></lb>(as I eſteem hitherto falſe) Opinion, I ſhall thinke I have not 
<lb></lb>unprofitably ſpent my paynes and time. </s><s>and although that come 
<lb></lb>not to paſſe, yet ought I to promiſe another benefit to my ſelfe,

<s>And to proceed with the greateſt plainneſs and perſpicuity that

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1434"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>ſequent of the Doctrine of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> namely, That water ſhould

<lb></lb>ction of <emph type="italics"></emph>Buonamico,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> is founded upon that which he citeth of the Ve­

<lb></lb>than water. </s><s>If this be the Illation. </s><s>I eaſily anſwer, granting that this 
<lb></lb>Veſſell is leſſe grave than water, and denying the other conſequence, 


<pb pagenum="421"></pb>namely, that Earth is leſs Grave than Water. </s><s>The Veſſel that ſwims 
<lb></lb>occupieth in the water, not only a place equall to the Maſs of the 
<lb></lb>Earth, of which it is formed; but equall to the Earth and to the Air 
<lb></lb>together, contained in its concavity. </s><s>And, if ſuch a Maſs compoun­
<lb></lb>ded of Earth and Air, ſhall be leſs grave than ſuch another quantity 
<lb></lb>of water, it ſhall ſwim, and ſhall accord with the Doctrine of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archi­
<lb></lb>medes<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end>; but if, again, removing the Air, the Veſſell ſhall be filled 
<lb></lb>with water, ſo that the Solid put in the water, be nothing but 
<lb></lb>Earth, nor occupieth other place, than that which is only poſſeſt by 
<lb></lb>Earth, it ſhall then go to the Bottom, by reaſon that the Earth is 
<lb></lb>heavier than the water: and this correſponds well with the meaning

<lb></lb>Experiment, In preſſing a Viall Glaſs to the Bottom of the water,

<lb></lb>not the Glaſs alone, that is preſſed under water, but together with 
<lb></lb>the Glaſs a great Maſs of Air, and ſuch, that if you ſhould take as 
<lb></lb>much water, as the Maſs of the Glaſs, and of the Air contained in it, 
<lb></lb>you would have a weight much greater than that of the Viall, and of 
<lb></lb>its Air: and, therefore, it will not ſubmerge without great violence: 
<lb></lb>but if we demit only the Glaſs into the water, which ſhall be when

<s>Returning, therefore, to our firſt purpoſe; I ſay, that Earth is 
<lb></lb>more grave than water, and that therefore, a Solid of Earth goeth to

<lb></lb>unto <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> the abſurdity of inferring by his doctrine, that Earth

<lb></lb>was attributed as a ſingular propertie, of ſome particular Water, and

<lb></lb>chimedes,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> ſince he ſaith no ſuch thing, nor by him that did ſay it was it 
<lb></lb>meant of the common Element of Water.</s></p><p type="main">

<s>The third difficulty in the doctrine of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> was, that he 
<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1435"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>could not render a reaſon whence it aroſe, that a piece of Wood, 
<lb></lb>and a Veſſell of Wood, which otherwiſe floats, goeth to the bottom, 
<lb></lb>if filled with Water. <emph type="italics"></emph>Signor Buonamico<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> hath ſuppoſed that a Verſſell 
<lb></lb>of Wood, and of Wood that by nature ſwims, as before is ſaid, 


<pb pagenum="422"></pb>goes to the bottom, if it be filled with water; of which he in the fol­
<lb></lb>lowing Chapter, which is the 30 of the fifth Book copiouſly diſcourſ­
<lb></lb>eth: but I (ſpeaking alwayes without diminution of his ſingular 
<lb></lb>Learning) dare in defence of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> deny this experiment, being 
<lb></lb>certain that a piece of Wood which by its nature ſinks not in Water, 
<lb></lb>ſhall not ſinke though it be turned and converted into the forme of a­
<lb></lb>ny Veſſell whatſoever, and then filled with Water: and he that would 
<lb></lb>readily ſee the Experiment in ſome other tractable Matter, and that is 
<lb></lb>eaſily reduced into ſeveral Figures, may take pure Wax, and ma­
<lb></lb>king it firſt into a Ball or other ſolid Figure, let him adde to it ſo 
<lb></lb>much Lead as ſhall juſt carry it to the bottome, ſo that being a graine 
<lb></lb>leſs it could not be able to ſinke it, and making it afterwards into 
<lb></lb>the forme of a Diſh, and filling it with Water, he ſhall finde that with­
<lb></lb>out the ſaid Lead it ſhall not ſinke, and that with the Lead it ſhall de­
<lb></lb>ſcend with much ſlowneſs: &amp; in ſhort he ſhall ſatisfie himſelf, that the 
<lb></lb>Water included makes no alteration. </s><s>I ſay not all this while, but that 
<lb></lb>its poſſible of Wood to make Barkes, which being filled with water, 
<lb></lb>ſinke; but that proceeds not through its Gravity, encreaſed by the 
<lb></lb>Water, but rather from the Nailes and other Iron Workes, ſo that 
<lb></lb>it no longer hath a Body leſs grave than Water, but one mixt of Iron 
<lb></lb>and Wood, more grave than a like Maſſe of Water. </s><s>Therefore let 
<lb></lb><emph type="italics"></emph>Signor Buonamico<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> deſiſt from deſiring a reaſon of an effect, that is 
<lb></lb>not in nature: yea if the ſinking of the Woodden Veſſell when its full 
<lb></lb>of Water, may call in queſtion the Doctrine of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> which 
<lb></lb>he would not have you to follow, is on the contrary conſonant and a­
<lb></lb>greeable to the Doctrine of the Peripateticks, ſince it aptly aſſignes a 
<lb></lb>reaſon why ſuch a Veſſell muſt, when its full of Water, deſcend to the 
<lb></lb>bottom; converting the Argument the other way, we may with 
<lb></lb>ſafety ſay that the Doctrine of <emph type="italics"></emph>Archimedes<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> is true, ſince it aptly agre­

<lb></lb>hinted in this ſame Inſtance, where it ſeemes that <emph type="italics"></emph>Benonamico<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> under­
<lb></lb>ſtands the ſame not only of a piece of wood, ſhaped in the forme of a 
<lb></lb>Veſſell, but alſo of maſſie Wood, which filled, <emph type="italics"></emph>ſcilicet,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> as I believe, he

<lb></lb>ing, there ſucceedeth Water into the ſame Poroſities and Cavities, 
<lb></lb>there reſults a compound of Water and Glaſs more grave than a like 
<lb></lb>Maſs of Water: but the exceſs of its Gravity conſiſts in the Matter

<lb></lb>contraſts with the Gravity of the ſame, it will be found to be all that 
<lb></lb>which we find to be beneath the Surface of the water, the which is 
<lb></lb>an aggregate and Compound of a Board of Ebony, and of almoſt

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1476"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>pouring of Water therein, it ſhall become ſo grave, that it ſhall ſink 
<lb></lb>to the Bottom, and that by reaſon of the new weight added thereto. 
<lb></lb></s><s>To this I will return anſwer, as above, that the Gravity of the 
<lb></lb>Water, contained in the Veſſel is not that which ſinks it to the Bot­
<lb></lb>tom, but the proper Gravity of the Braſs, ſuperiour to the Specificall 
<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1478"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>Gravity of the Water: for if the Veſſel were leſs grave than 
<lb></lb>water, the Ocean would not ſuffice to ſubmerge it. </s><s>And, give me 
<lb></lb>leave to repeat it again, as the fundamentall and principall point in 
<lb></lb>this Caſe, that the Air contained in this Veſſel before the infuſion of 
<lb></lb>the Water, was that which kept it a-float, ſince that there was made 
<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1479"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>of it, and of the Braſs, a Compoſition leſs grave than an equall quanti­
<lb></lb>ty of Water: and the place that the Veſſel occupyeth in the 
<lb></lb>Water whilſt it floats, is not equall to the Braſs alone, but to the 
<lb></lb>Braſs and to the Air together, which filleth that part of the Veſſel 
<lb></lb>that is below the Levell of the water: Moreover, when the Water 
<lb></lb>is infuſed, the Air is removed, and there is a compoſition made of 
<lb></lb>Braſs and of water, more grave <emph type="italics"></emph>in ſpecie<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> than the ſimple water, but 
<lb></lb>not by vertue of the water infuſed, as having greater Specifick 
<lb></lb>Gravity than the other water, but through the proper Gravity of 
<lb></lb>the Braſs, and through the alienation of the Air. </s><s>Now, as he that 
<lb></lb>ſhould ſay that Braſs, that by its nature goes to the Bottom, being 
<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg1480"></arrow.to.target>
<lb></lb>formed into the Figure of a Ketle, acquireth from that Figure a 
<lb></lb>vertue of lying in the Water without ſinking, would ſay that which 
<lb></lb>is falſe; becauſe that Braſs faſhioned into any whatever Figure, 
<lb></lb>goeth always to the Bottom, provided, that that which is put into the 
<lb></lb>water be ſimple Braſs; and it is not the Figure of the Veſſel that 
<lb></lb>makes the Braſs to float, but it is becauſe that that is not purely 
<lb></lb>Braſs which is put into the water, but an aggregate of Braſs and of 
<lb></lb>Air: ſo is it neither more nor leſs falſe, that a thin Plate of Braſs 


<pb pagenum="438"></pb>or of Ebony, ſwims by vertue of its dilated &amp; broad Figure: for the 
<lb></lb>truth is, that it bares up without ſubmerging, becauſe that that which 
<lb></lb>is put in the water, is not pure Braſs or ſimple Ebony, but an ag­
<lb></lb>gregate of Braſs and Air, or of Ebony and Air. </s><s>And, this is not 
<lb></lb>contrary unto my Concluſion, the which, (having many a time ſeen

<pb pagenum="462"></pb>which I had not before obſerved, to wit, that in the Aſcent of the

<lb></lb>goeth to repeat the Experiment with the Ball, and makes me ſee, 
<lb></lb>that it is but a very ſmall quantity of water, which cleaves to its 
<lb></lb>compacted and contracted Figure: and then he ſubjoynes, that its 
<lb></lb>no wonder, if in ſeperating the thinne and broad Plate from the 
<lb></lb>water, we meet with much greater Reſiſtance, than in ſeperating the 
<lb></lb>Ball, ſince together with the Plate, we are to raiſe a great quantity of 
<lb></lb>water, which occurreth not in the Ball: He telleth me moreover, 
<lb></lb>how that our Queſtion is, whether the Reſiſtance of Elevation be 
<lb></lb>greater in a dilated Plate of Lead, than in a Ball, and not whether 
<lb></lb>more reſiſteth a Plate of Lead with a great quantity of water, or a 
<lb></lb>Ball with a very little water: He ſheweth me in the cloſe, that the 
<lb></lb>putting the Plate and the Ball firſt into the water, to make proofe 
<lb></lb>thereby of their Reſiſtance in the Air, is beſides our caſe, which 
<lb></lb>treats of Elivating in the Air, and of things placed in the Air, and 
<lb></lb>not of the Reſiſtance that is made in the Confines of the Air and

<lb></lb>laſtly, they make me feel with my hand, that when the thinne Plate 
<lb></lb>is in the Air, and free from the weight of the water, it is raiſed with 
<lb></lb>the very ſame Force that raiſeth the Ball. </s><s>Seeing, and underſtand­
<lb></lb>ing theſe things, I know not what to do, unleſs to grant my ſelf con­
<lb></lb>vinced, and to thank ſuch a Friend, for having made me to ſee that 
<lb></lb>which I never till then obſerved: and, being advertiſed by this ſame

<lb></lb>Board and a Ball of Ebony, equally go to the bottom in water, and 
<lb></lb>not a Ball of Ebony and a Board of Ebony, joyned with another 
<lb></lb>flat Body of Air: and, farthermore, that we ſpeak of ſinking, and 
<lb></lb>not ſinking to the bottom, in water, and not of that which happeneth 
<lb></lb>in the Confines of the water and Air to Bodies that be part in the

<lb></lb>or leſſer Force requiſite in ſeperating this or that Body from the Air; 
<lb></lb>not omitting to tell them, in the laſt place, that the Air doth reſiſt, 
<lb></lb>and gravitate downwards in the water, juſt ſo much as the water (if 
<lb></lb>I may ſo ſpeak) gravitates and reſiſts upwards in the Air, and that the 
<lb></lb>ſame force is required to ſinke a Bladder under water, that is full of 
<lb></lb>Air, as to raiſe it in the Air, being full of water, removing the con­

<lb></lb>is required to ſink a Cup or ſuch like Veſſell under water, whilſt it is

<lb></lb>ter or Circumference of the ſaid Plate, and according to the big­

<lb></lb>inceſſion of four Feet. </s><s>This granted, he that hath any knowledge

<lb></lb>that all Figures, the more ſhort and narrow they be, ſhall ſo much the 
<lb></lb>better ſwim. </s><s>Let the Board ABCD be, for Example, eight 
<lb></lb>Palmes long, and five broad, its circuit ſhall be twenty ſix Palmes;

<lb></lb>we muſt adde to the twenty ſix Palmes of the circuit of the whole 
<lb></lb>Board, ſeventy others; whereupon the eight little pieces ſo cut and 
<lb></lb>ſeperated, have to cut ninty ſix Palmes of water. </s><s>And, if moreover, 
<lb></lb>we cur each of the ſaid pieces into five parts, re­
<lb></lb><figure id="fig280"></figure>
<lb></lb>ducing them into Squares, to the circuit of ninty 
<lb></lb>ſix Palmes, with four cuts of eight Palmes apiece; 
<lb></lb>we ſhall adde alſo ſixty four Palmes, whereupon 
<lb></lb>the ſaid Squares to deſcend in the water, muſt 
<lb></lb>divide one hundred and ſixty Palmes of water,
