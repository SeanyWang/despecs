<lb></lb>way certain new Obſervations, which yet ſerve only for the Aſtronomical Facility, not for Natural 

<lb></lb>Neceßity. </s><s>In the third place I will propoſe an ingenuous Fancy. </s><s>I remember that I have ſaid many 

<lb></lb>years ſince, that the unknown Probleme of the Tide might receive ſome light, admitting the Earths 

<lb></lb>Motion. </s><s>This Poſition of mine paſsing from one to another had found charitable Fathers that

<lb></lb>move. </s><s>I hope, that by theſe Conſider ations the World will come to know, that if other Nations have

<lb></lb>that made in part of the time, by the ſole part C B, it hinders

<lb></lb>re-aſſuming the ſame Figure which we uſed before, let us remem­

<lb></lb>ber that we did agree, that the Deſcendent by the inclination C

<lb></lb>acquired equal degrees of velocity in the terms B and A: now to 

<lb></lb>proceed, I ſuppoſe you will not ſcruple to grant, that upon ano­

<lb></lb>the motion of the deſcendent would be yet more ſlow than in the 

<lb></lb>plane A C. </s><s>So that it is not any whit dubitable, but that there 

<lb></lb>may be planes ſo little elevated above the Horizon A B, that the 

<lb></lb>moveable, namely the ſame ball, in any the longeſt time may 

<lb></lb>reach the point A, which being to move by the plane A B, an infi­

<lb></lb>nite time would not ſuffice: and the motion is made always more 

<lb></lb>ſlowly, by how much the declination is leſs. </s><s>It muſt be therefore 

<lb></lb>confeſt, that there may be a point taken upon the term B, ſo near 

<lb></lb>to the ſaid B, that drawing from thence to the point A a plane, 

<lb></lb>the ball would not paſs it in a whole year. </s><s>It is requiſite next 

<lb></lb>for you to know, that the <emph type="italics"></emph>impetus,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> namely the degree of velo­

<lb></lb>city the ball is found to have acquired when it arriveth at the 

<lb></lb>point A, is ſuch, that ſhould it continue to move with this ſelf-ſame

<pb xlink:href="065/01/024.jpg" pagenum="18"></pb>in as much more time as it was in coming by the inclining plane, it 

<lb></lb>would paſs double the ſpace of the plane inclined: namely (for

<lb></lb>tinuing to move uniformly with that degree of velocity which it 

<lb></lb>is found to have in its arriving at the term A, it ſhall paſs in an 

<lb></lb>hour a ſpace double the length D A; and becauſe (as we have 

<lb></lb>ſaid) the degrees of velocity acquired in the points B and A, by 

<lb></lb>the moveables that depart from any point taken in the perpendicu­

<lb></lb>lar C B, and that deſcend, the one by the inclined plane, the o­

<lb></lb>ther by the ſaid perpendicular, are always equal: therefore the 

<lb></lb>cadent by the perpendicular may depart from a term ſo near to B, 

<lb></lb>that the degree of velocity acquired in B, would not ſuffice (ſtill 

<lb></lb>maintaining the ſame) to conduct the moveable by a ſpace dou­

<lb></lb>ble the length of the plane inclined in a year, nor in ten, no nor

<lb></lb>that according to the ordinary courſe of nature a moveable, all

<lb></lb>clining plane with greater and greater tardity, according as the 

<lb></lb>inclination ſhall be leſs; ſo that in the end the tardity comes to be 

<lb></lb>infinite, which is, when the inclination concludeth in, and joyneth 

<lb></lb>to the horizontal plane; and if it be true likewiſe, that the de­

<lb></lb>gree of velocity acquired in ſome point of the inclined plane, is 

<lb></lb>equal to that degree of velocity which is found to be in the move­

<lb></lb>able that deſcends by the perpendicular, in the point cut by a

<lb></lb>ning plane; it muſt of neceſſity be granted, that the cadent de­

<lb></lb>parting from reſt, paſſeth thorow all the infinite degrees of tar­

<lb></lb>dity, and that conſequently, to acquire a determinate degree of 

<lb></lb>velocity, it is neceſſary that it move firſt by right lines, deſcend­

<lb></lb>ing by a ſhort or long ſpace, according as the velocity to be acqui­

<lb></lb>red, ought to be either leſs or greater, and according as the plane 

<lb></lb>on which it deſcendeth is more or leſs inclined; ſo that a plane 

<lb></lb>may be given with ſo ſmall inclination, that to acquire in it the 

<lb></lb>aſſigned degree of velocity, it muſt firſt move in a very great ſpace, 

<lb></lb>and take a very long time; whereupon in the horizontal plane, any 

<lb></lb>how little ſoever velocity, would never be naturally acquired,

<lb></lb>it, which towards the circumference of the Solar Circle,

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg145"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>Moon is manifeſtly like to the Earth in figure, which undoubtedly 

<lb></lb>is ſpherical, as may be neceſſarily concluded from the aſpect of its 

<lb></lb>ſurface, which is perfectly Orbicular, and the manner of its re­

<lb></lb>ceiving the light of the Sun, from which, if its ſurface were flat, 

<lb></lb>it would come to be all in one and the ſame time illuminated, and 

<lb></lb>likewiſe again in another inſtant of time obſcured, and not thoſe 

<lb></lb>parts firſt, which are ſituate towards the Sun, and the reſt ſucceſ­

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg147"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>matter to be moſt denſe and ſolid as the Earth is, which I clearly

<lb></lb>rectly reſembling our moſt ſharp and craggy mountains, of which 

<lb></lb>you ſhall there perceive ſome extend and run in ledges of an hun­

<lb></lb>dred miles long; others are contracted into rounder forms; and 

<lb></lb>there are alſo many craggy, ſolitary, ſteep and cliffy rocks. </s><s>But 

<lb></lb>that of which there are frequenteſt appearances, are certain Banks

<lb></lb>of ſeveral bigneſſes, and form ſundry figures, but for the moſt part 

<lb></lb>circular; many of which have in the midſt a mount raiſed pretty 

<lb></lb>high, and ſome few are repleniſhed with a matter ſomewhat ob­

<lb></lb>Fourthly, like as the ſurface of our Globe is diſtinguiſhed into two 

<lb></lb>principal parts, namely, into the Terreſtrial and Aquatick: ſo in 

<lb></lb>the Lunar ſurface we diſcern a great diſtinction of ſome great fields 

<lb></lb>more reſplendant, and ſome leſs: whoſe aſpect makes me believe, 

<lb></lb>that that of the Earth would ſeem very like it, beheld by any one 

<lb></lb>from the Moon, or any other the like diſtance, to be illuminated 

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg149"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg214"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>productions there are required ſo many variable aſpects of the Sun, 

<lb></lb>that without them they would all miſcarry: now the habitudes of

<lb></lb>Piece from C A to A D ſhould confer ſuch an inclination upon 

<lb></lb>the tranſverſe line C D, that by means thereof, the ball when it 

<lb></lb>cometh afterwards into the air ſhould be able to follow the courſe

<lb></lb>of the tranſverſe line C D, I believe it is much greater than you 

<lb></lb>take it to be, for I verily think that the velocity of the Earths mo­

<lb></lb>tion, not onely under the Equinoctial, but in our paralel alſo, is 

<lb></lb>greater than that of the ball whilſt it moveth in the Piece; ſo that 

<lb></lb>the interval C E would be abſolutely much bigger than the whole 

<lb></lb>length of the Piece, and the inclination of the tranſverſe line con­

<lb></lb>ſequently bigger than half a right angle: but be the velocity of 

<lb></lb>the Earth more, or be it leſs, in compariſon of the velocity of the 

<lb></lb>fire, this imports nothing; for if the velocity of the Earth be ſmall, 

<lb></lb>and conſequently the inclination of the tranſverſe line be little 

<lb></lb>alſo; there is then alſo need but of little inclination to make the

<lb></lb>word, if you do but attentively conſider, you will comprehend,

<lb></lb>much of little or great inclination, as is required to adjuſt the

<lb></lb>the bird flieth a great pace, therefore they ſhould aim their ſhot far 

<lb></lb>from the bird, anticipating its flight for a certain ſpace, and more 

<lb></lb>or leſs according to its velocity and the diſtance of the bird, that 

<lb></lb>ſo the bullet haſting directly to the mark aimed at, it might come 

<lb></lb>to arrive at the ſelf ſame time in the ſame point with its motion, 

<lb></lb>and the bird with its flight, and by that means one to encounter 

<lb></lb>the other: and asking one of them, if their practiſe was not ſo 

<lb></lb>to do; He told me, no; but that the ſlight was very eaſie and 

<lb></lb>certain, and that they took aim juſt in the ſame manner as if they 

<lb></lb>had ſhot at a bird that did ſit ſtill; that is, they made the flying 

<lb></lb>bird their mark, and by moving their fowling-piece they followed 

<lb></lb>her, keeping their aim ſtill full upon her, till ſuch time as they let 

<lb></lb>fly, and in this manner ſhot her as they did others ſitting ſtill. </s><s>It is 

<lb></lb>neceſſary therefore that that motion, though ſlow, which the fowl­

<lb></lb>ing-piece maketh in turning and following after the flight of the 

<lb></lb>bird do communicate it ſelf to the bullet alſo, and that it be joyned 

<lb></lb>with that of the fire; ſo that the ball hath from the fire the mo­

<lb></lb>tion directly upwards, and from the concave Cylinder of the barrel 

<lb></lb>the declination according to the flight of the Bird, juſt as was ſaid 

<lb></lb>before of the ſhot of a Canon; where the ball receiveth from the 

<lb></lb>fire a virtue of mounting upwards towards the Zenith, and from 

<lb></lb>the motion of the Earth its winding towards the Eaſt, and of both 

<lb></lb>maketh a compound motion that followeth the courſe of the

<lb></lb>wards, and return again downwards by the ſame line. </s><s>The hold­

<lb></lb>ing therefore of the gun continually directed towards the mark,

<lb></lb>in compariſon of the flight of the ſaid bird; whence me thinks it 

<lb></lb>ſhould follow, that that ſmall motion which the turning of the

<lb></lb>ſhall have run many feet; the Fiſhes in their water ſhall not ſwim 

<lb></lb>with more trouble towards the fore-part, than towards the hinder 

<lb></lb>part of the tub; but ſhall with equal velocity make to the bait 

<lb></lb>placed on any ſide of the tub; and laſtly, the flies and gnats 

<lb></lb>ſhall continue their flight indifferently towards all parts; nor 

<lb></lb>ſhall they ever happen to be driven together towards the ſide of

<lb></lb>ble that the mover and moved ſhould be totally the ſame thing: 

<lb></lb>And this is manifeſt, not onely in things that are moved by an ex­

<lb></lb>trinſick mover; but it is gathered alſo from the principles pro­

<lb></lb>pounded, that the ſame holdeth true in the natural motion depen­

<lb></lb>that all moveth, and all is moved; but its neceſſary in the thing

<lb></lb>great diſtance from the Pole, ſo that to us <emph type="italics"></emph>Septentrionals,<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> it did 

<lb></lb>never ſet, it was an eaſie matter with Aſtronomical inſtruments

<lb></lb>ſituate at different diſtances from the North, that is, different

<lb></lb>other fixed ſtars, its meridian altitudes taken in divers elevations 

<lb></lb>of the pole, ought neceſſarily to differ from each other with the 

<lb></lb>ſame variations that are found amongſt thoſe elevations them­

<lb></lb>ſelves; that is, for example, if the elevation of the ſtar above

<lb></lb>altitude was <emph type="italics"></emph>v. </s><s>gr.<emph.end type="italics"></emph.end> 45 degrees, the elevation of the ſame ſtar 

<lb></lb>ought to have been encreaſed 4 or 5 degrees in thoſe more Nor­

<lb></lb>grees. </s><s>But if the ſtars diſtance from the Earth was but very little, 

<lb></lb>in compariſon of that of the Firmament; its meridian altitudes 

<lb></lb>ought approaching to the North to encreaſe conſiderably more 

<lb></lb>than the polar altitudes; and by that greater encreaſe, that is, 

<lb></lb>by the exceſſe of the encreaſe of the ſtars elevation, above the 

<lb></lb>encreaſe of the polar elevation (which is called the difference of 

<lb></lb>Parallaxes) is readily calculated with a cleer and ſure method,

<lb></lb>they had in like manner erred in determining all thoſe things which 

<lb></lb>cannot be perfectly adjuſted without allowance for the Refracti­

<lb></lb>ons; amongſt which things one is the preciſe inveſtigation of the 

<lb></lb>Polar Altitudes, which are commonly taken from the two Meridi­

<lb></lb>which Altitudes will come to be altered by Refraction in the ſame 

<lb></lb>manner, juſt as thoſe of the new Star; ſo that the Polar Altitude 

<lb></lb>that is deduced from them, will prove to be defective, and to par­

<lb></lb>ſwering to your demands, I ſay, that I alſo have long thought

<lb></lb>armeth the Magnet, and the other that conjoyns it ſelf unto it. 

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg707"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>And firſt, we are certain, that the vertue and ſtrength of the ſtone 

<lb></lb>doth not augment by being armed, for it neither attracts at 

<lb></lb>greater diſtance, nor doth it hold an Iron the faſter, if between it, 

<lb></lb>and the arming or cap, a very fine paper, or a leaf of beaten gold, 

<lb></lb>be interpoſed; nay, with that interpoſition, the naked ſtone 

<lb></lb>takes up more Iron than the armed. </s><s>There is therefore no alte­

<lb></lb>ration in the vertue, and yet there is an innovation in the effect. 

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg708"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>And becauſe its neceſſary, that a new effect have a new cauſe, if 

<lb></lb>it be inquired what novelty is introduced in the act of taking up 

<lb></lb>with the cap or arming, there is no mutation to be diſcovered, but 

<lb></lb>in the different contact; for whereas before Iron toucht Load­

<lb></lb>ſtone, now Iron toucheth Iron. </s><s>Therefore it is neceſſary to con­

<lb></lb>clude, that the diverſity of contacts is the cauſe of the diverſity 

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg709"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>of effects. </s><s>And for the difference of contacts it cannot, as I ſee, 

<lb></lb>be derived from any thing elſe, ſave from that the ſubſtance of 

<lb></lb>the Iron is of parts more ſubtil, more pure, and more compact­





<pb xlink:href="065/01/381.jpg" pagenum="371"></pb>ed than thoſe of the Magnet, which are more groſſe, impure, and

<lb></lb>burniſhed, do ſo exactly conjoyn, that all the infinite points of 

<lb></lb>the one meet with the infinite points of the other; ſo that the 

<lb></lb>filaments, if I may ſo ſay, that collegate the two Irons, are many 

<lb></lb>more than thoſe that collegate the Magnet to the Iron, by reaſon 

<lb></lb>that the ſubſtance of the Magnet is more porous, and leſſe com­

<lb></lb>pact, which maketh that all the points and filaments of the Load­

<lb></lb>ſtone do not cloſe with that which it unites unto. </s><s>In the next

<lb></lb>and pure than the matter of the Loadſtone, is ſeen, in that one 

<lb></lb>may bring its edge to an extraordinary ſharpneſſe, ſuch as is that 

<lb></lb>of the Raſor, which can never be in any great meaſure effected in 

<lb></lb>a piece of Magnet. </s><s>Then, as for the impurity of the Magnet, and 

<lb></lb><arrow.to.target n="marg710"></arrow.to.target>

<lb></lb>its being mixed with other qualities of ſtone, it is firſt ſenſibly 

<lb></lb>diſcovered by the colour of ſome little ſpots, for the moſt part 

<lb></lb>white; and next by preſenting a needle to it, hanging in a 

<lb></lb>thread, which upon thoſe ſtonyneſſes cannot find repoſe, but

<lb></lb>bundance, which, for their ſmallneſſe, are imperceptible, that are 

<lb></lb>diſſeminated throughout the whole maſſe. </s><s>That which I ſay, 

<lb></lb>(namely, that the multitude of contacts that are made between 

<lb></lb>Iron and Iron, is the cauſe of the ſo ſolid conjunction) is con­

<lb></lb>firmed by an experiment, which is this, that if we preſent the 

<lb></lb>ſharpned point of a needle to the cap of a Magnet, it will ſtick 

<lb></lb>no faſter to it, than to the ſame ſtone unarmed: which can 

<lb></lb>proceed from no other cauſe, than from the equality of the con­

<lb></lb>tacts that are both of one ſole point. </s><s>But what then? </s><s>Let a

<lb></lb>Nail yet a little further, the Needle will forſake the Magnet;

<lb></lb>the point towards the Magnet; but if the eye be towards the 

<lb></lb>Loadſtone, in withdrawing the Nail the Needle will cleave to 

<lb></lb>the Magnet; and this, in my judgment, for no other reaſon,
