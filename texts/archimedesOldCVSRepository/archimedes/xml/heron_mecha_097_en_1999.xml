<s id="A18-1.01.01">We want to move a known load by means of a known force through the mechanism of cogwheels.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.02">For this purpose one builds a frame, similar to a box, in the longest parallel sides of which rest parallel axles at a space measured so that the cogs of the one mesh with the cogs of the others, as we are going to explain directly.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.03">Let this frame be a box, designated with &lt;abgd&gt;, in it let rest a light mobile axle, designated &lt;ez&gt;, on which is attached a cogwheel, the wheel &lt;hq&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.04">Let its diameter be, for instance, five times the diameter of the axle &lt;ez&gt;. But in order to explain our construction with an example let us assume the load to be pulled is one thousand talents and the moving force is five talents, that is the man or the boy who alone, without a machine, can move five talents.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.05">If we now insert the ropes fastened to the load through a hole in the side &lt;ab&gt; so they wind up on axle &lt;ez&gt;, by the rotation of cog &lt;hq&gt; and the winding up of the ropes the load can be moved.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.06">To make the cogwheel &lt;hq&gt; move, however, one needs two hundred talents of force, because the diameter of the cogwheel is five times the diameter of the axle, according to our assumption - this has been shown in the proofs of the five simple powers.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.07">We do not, however, have a force of 200 talents, since the force assumed by us is five talents; thus the cogwheel will not be moved.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.08">Let us now construct another axle, parallel to axle &lt;ez&gt;, namely the axle &lt;kl&gt;, and let a cogwheel, namely the cogwheel &lt;mn&gt;, be attached to it; let further the wheel &lt;hq&gt; also have cogs that mesh with the cogs of wheel &lt;mn&gt; and let another wheel be attached to the axle &lt;kl&gt;, namely &lt;co&gt;, whose diameter is five times the diameter of &lt;mn&gt;, so that one needs, in order to move the load through the wheel &lt;co&gt;, 40 talents of force, since a fifth of 200 talents is 40 talents.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.09">We further let the wheel &lt;co&gt; mesh with another wheel, namely the wheel &lt;px&gt;, which is attached to another axle, namely the axle &lt;fi&gt;, further let another cogwheel be attached to this axle, whose diameter is five times the diameter of &lt;px&gt;, namely the wheel &lt;ss&gt;, then the force that moves the load at the sign &lt;ss&gt; will be 8 talents; the force assumed by us is, however, only five talents.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.10">Let us therefore put in another cogwheel, namely the cogwheel &lt;tt'&gt;, whose diameter is double the diameter of wheel &lt;ss&gt;, and let it be attached to another axle, the axle &lt;h'd'&gt;, so that the wheel &lt;tt'&gt; needs four talents of force, so there is in this force a surplus of one talent, which one uses to overcome the resistance of the wheels that may occur.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.11">Our explanation illuminates: When the mover sets the wheel &lt;tt'&gt; in motion, the axle &lt;h'd'&gt; rotates and through its rotation the wheel &lt;ss&gt; rotates; therefore the axle &lt;fi&gt; rotates and the wheel &lt;px&gt; rotates; at the same time the wheel &lt;co&gt; and the axle &lt;kl&gt; rotate; therefore, the wheel &lt;mn&gt; rotates and the wheel &lt;mn&gt; sets the wheel &lt;hq&gt; in rotation, because of which also the axle &lt;ez&gt; rotates, the ropes wind up around the axle and the load is lifted.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.12">Thus we have, through a force of five talents, lifted a load in the amount of 1000 talents, by means of the mechanism just described. q.e.d.</s>
<s id="A18-1.01.13">Note: It is necessary that the axis IO goes out to I, and on it, the perpendicular I, is erected equal to the semi-diameter of wheel IP or more than it, and god knows better. TB (note on the margin, not translated by Nix/Schmidt)</s>

<s id="A18-1.02.01">2. On the wheels.</s>
<s id="A18-1.02.02">The wheels attached to an axle always move in one direction, namely the direction in which the axle moves.</s>
<s id="A18-1.02.03">The wheels that are resting on two axles and whose cogs mesh with each others', move in two different directions, so that the one goes to the right, the other to the left.</s>
<s id="A18-1.02.04">If both wheels are equal, the rotation of the one to the right entirely corresponds to the rotation of the other to the left; if they are, however, unequal, so that one is larger than the other, the smaller one rotates more often, until the larger one rotates once, according to their sizes.</s>
</p>
<p n="3">
<s id="A18-1.03.01">[3] After this has been made clear in this introduction, let us rotate two equal circles, namely &lt;hekd&gt; and &lt;zgqe&gt;, around their centers &lt;a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, while they touch at point &lt;e&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.02">If they now move from point &lt;e&gt; for the same time for half their extant, point &lt;e&gt; in this time runs through the arc &lt;ehd&gt; and reaches the point &lt;d&gt; by moving like the point &lt;g&gt; on the arc &lt;gqe&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.03">Then it can occur that points move in the same direction and that they move in opposite directions.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.04">The ones positioned on the same side move in opposite directions, the ones opposed to each other move in the same direction.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.05">It may occur however, that points that are described as being in opposite motion go in the same direction (both upward or both downward).For, when points move and their motion starts from one point, namely the point &lt;e&gt;, and we imagine two lines &lt;zaq&gt; and &lt;hbk&gt; perpendicular to the line &lt;gd&gt;, then the motion on the arc &lt;ez&gt; is the opposite of the motion on the arc &lt;eh&gt;, since the one goes to the right, the other to the left side.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.06">The motion can also occur in the same direction, if we imagine the distance of the points staying the same from &lt;zh&gt; (text &lt;zk&gt;).Likewise when the motion on the arc &lt;zg&gt; and &lt;hd&gt; towards &lt;g&gt; and &lt;d&gt; is balanced.We also have to assume the same for the arcs &lt;gq&gt;, &lt;dk&gt; and for the arcs &lt;qe&gt; and &lt;ke&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.07">We further say that they can move in the same direction.For we say that the points &lt;de&gt; move in the same direction (this time to the left), when point &lt;e&gt; moves on the arc &lt;ezg&gt; and point &lt;d&gt; on the arc &lt;dke&gt;, and their distance from points &lt;z&gt;, &lt;k&gt; as well as their approach to them remains the same, so the motion is still called opposite (because &lt;e&gt; moves up, then down, &lt;d&gt; down, then up).</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.08">Therefore the same and the opposite are just complementary and in any motion one has to distinguish between the same and the opposite.</s>
<s id="A18-1.03.09">This our explanation has to be observed with equal circles.As for different circles, we shall demonstrate it in the following.</s>
</p>
<p n="4">
<s id="A18-1.04.01">[4] On the different circles.Now let the circles be unequal; and let their centers lie on the two points &lt;a&gt; and &lt;b&gt;, further let the larger of the two circles be the one whose center lies on point &lt;a&gt;, then the order with these circles will not be perfect as with equal circles.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.02">Let us now assume two points that we let rotate from point &lt;e&gt; and let us make, to pose an example, the diameter &lt;ge&gt; twice the size of the diameter &lt;ed&gt;, then the arc &lt;ezg&gt; will be twice the arc &lt;ehd&gt;, for Archimedes has already proven this.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.03">Then in the same time that point &lt;e&gt; in its motion towards &lt;g&gt; runs along the arc &lt;ez&gt;, point &lt;e&gt; will run in the opposite direction along the arc &lt;ehd&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.04">Further in the same time that point &lt;e&gt;, starting at &lt;z&gt;, runs along the arc &lt;zg&gt;, point &lt;e&gt; will, starting at &lt;d&gt;, run along the arc &lt;dke&gt; and reach point &lt;e&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.05">Thus the point that runs along the arc &lt;ehdke&gt; will one time make the opposite motion to the point that runs along the arc &lt;ezg&gt;, the other time be equal to it.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.06">Further, in the same time that point &lt;g&gt; runs through the arc &lt;gqe&gt;, point &lt;e&gt; runs through the arc &lt;ehdke&gt;, partially in the same, partially in the opposite direction as &lt;g&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.04.07">If now the one arc is three times as large as the other one, or in any other relation to it, then we shall show that the moving points are moving partially in the same, partially in the opposite direction.</s>
</p>
<p n="5">
<s id="A18-1.05.01">[5] If we imagine a third constructed circle which touches the circle with the center &lt;b&gt;, so we shall prove for the third circle what we mentioned about the first one.For if the first circle is moving in the direction opposite from the second one, the second one however moves opposite to the third, then the motion of the first circle is the same as that of the third.</s>
<s id="A18-1.05.02">For if something is moving in the same manner as something else, this however moves in the opposite direction of a third thing, so is the first thing moving in the direction opposite to the third.</s>
<s id="A18-1.05.03">If further a fourth circle is present, we proceed after the same method.In general, what ensues from the three circles will occur with all circles whose number is odd and what ensues from the two circles takes place with all circles whose number is even.</s>
<s id="A18-1.05.04">But one not only sees with two and more circles that the motion is now equal, now opposite, but in one circle one sees the same point move now in one direction, now in its opposite.</s>
<s id="A18-1.05.05">For when the moving point starts moving at any point, it does not stop moving in the same direction until it has run through a semicircle; when it now runs through the second semicircle it moves in the direction opposite to it.</s>
</p>
<p n="6">
<s id="A18-1.06.01">[6] Further, the larger circles do not aloways move faster than the small ones, but sometimes the smaller ones are faster than the larger ones.For when the circles are attached to one axle the larger ones move faster than the smaller ones.</s>
<s id="A18-1.06.02">When, however, the circles are distant from one another, but on the same body, namely not on the same axle, as occurs with a wagon with many wheels, the smaller circles move faster than the large ones, because their locomotion is one and the same and each of them in the same time moves (the same distance); therefore the smaller circle has to make several rotations until the large one makes one, so therefore the smaller one is in a faster motion.</s>
</p>
<p n="7">
<s id="A18-1.07.01">[7] Sometimes however the motion of the smaller and the larger circles can be equally fast, even when the circles are attached to the same center and rotate around it.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.02">Let us assume two circles attached to the same center &lt;a&gt; and let a tangent to the larger circle be given, namely the line &lt;bb'&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.03">If we further connect the points &lt;a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, then line &lt;ab&gt; is perpendicular to line &lt;bb'&gt; and line &lt;bb'&gt; is parallel to line &lt;gg'&gt;; then line &lt;gg'&gt; is a tangent of the smaller circle.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.04">If we further draw through point &lt;a&gt; a line that is parallel to these lines, namely line &lt;aa'&gt;, then if we imagine the larger circle rolling on line &lt;bb'&gt;, the smaller circle will roll by running through the line &lt;gg'&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.05">When now the larger circle has made one rotation, we see that the smaller one also has made one rotation, so that the position of the circles is the position of those circles whose center is at &lt;a'&gt; and the position of line &lt;ab&gt; is that which is taken by line &lt;a'b'&gt;.Therefore line &lt;bb'&gt; equals line &lt;gg'&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.06">Line &lt;bb'&gt; however is the line on which the larger circle rolls when it makes one rotation and line &lt;gg'&gt; is the line on which the smaller circle rolls when it makes one rotation; thus the motion of the smaller circle is equally fast as that of the larger one, because line &lt;bb'&gt; equals line &lt;gg'&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.07">Things that run through the same distance in the same time, however, have equal speed and equal motion.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.08">One might think this sentence is absurd, since it is impossible that the circumference of the larger circle should equal the circumference of the smaller one.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.09">We now say that not only the circumference of the smaller circle has rolled on line &lt;gg'&gt;, but that the smaller circle also runs through the path of the larger one, thus we see that the smaller circle through two motions reaches the same speed as the larger one; then, if we imagine the larger circle rolling, the smaller one, however, not rolling, but only attached to the point &lt;g&gt;, then it will in the same time cover line &lt;gg'&gt;; then the center &lt;a&gt; covers in this time line &lt;aa'&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-1.07.10">This however equals the lines &lt;bb'&gt; and &lt;gg'&gt;; thus the continuous rolling of the smaller circle does not make any difference in the motion and as a consequence the length of the distance of the larger circle is the same as that covered by the small circle; for we see that the center, without rolling, covers the same distance, due to the motion the large circle is in.</s>
</p>
<p n="8">
<s id="A18-1.08.01">[8] As for the case that a point that is moving in two motions of constant speed can follow unequal lines, we are going to prove that now.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.02">Let us assume a rectangle, namely &lt;abgd&gt;, and let the line &lt;ad&gt; be a diagonal; further let the point &lt;a&gt; run in steady motion on the line &lt;ab&gt; and let the line move in steady motion on the two lines &lt;ag&gt;, &lt;bd&gt;, so that it is always parallel to line &lt;gd&gt;; also let the time in which point &lt;a&gt; runs to &lt;b&gt; be equal to the time in which line &lt;ab&gt; reaches &lt;gd&gt;; thus I say that point &lt;a&gt; in a certain time covers two unequal lines.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.03">Proof for this: If line &lt;ab&gt; moves for a certain time and is placed on line &lt;ez&gt;, then the point moving on line &lt;ab&gt; in the same time comes to rest on line &lt;ez&gt; and a constant relation sets in.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.04">The relation between line &lt;ag&gt; and line &lt;ab&gt;, i.e., with line &lt;gd&gt;, is, namely, equal to the relation of line &lt;ae&gt; with the line that lies between point &lt;e&gt; and the point moving on it.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.05">Line &lt;ag&gt;, however, is to line &lt;gd&gt; as &lt;ae&gt; is to &lt;eh&gt;.Thus the point moving on line &lt;ab&gt; after &lt;h&gt; falls on the line &lt;ad&gt;, which is the diagonal.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.06">Similarly we prove that the point running on line &lt;ab&gt; constantly moves forward on line &lt;ad&gt; and is at the same time moving on lines &lt;ad&gt; and &lt;ab&gt;.The two lines &lt;ad&gt; and &lt;ab&gt; are, however, different; thus, the point moving forward in steady motion covers unequal lines in the same time.</s>
<s id="A18-1.08.07">But, as I said, the motion of the point on line &lt;ab&gt; is simple, its motion on the diagonal &lt;ad&gt; however is derived from the motion of &lt;ab&gt; on the two lines &lt;ag&gt; and &lt;bd&gt; and the motion of &lt;a&gt; on line &lt;ab&gt;.Thus the one point &lt;a&gt; covers in steady motion two unequal lines. q.e.d.</s>

<s id="A18-1.09.04">Let the known line be in a known ratio to another one and let us assume the mean proportional* between the two known lines, then this is the line sought; for if the lines are proportional among each other, then the ratio of the first to the third equals the ratio of the similar figures that are described above the first and the second according to the similarity.</s>

<s id="A18-1.11.01">[11] How to find two mean proportionals to two given lines, however, we want to explain now with the aid of an instrument, whereby we do not need solid figures; and we want to show the easiest method for this.</s>
<s id="A18-1.11.02">Let the two given lines be the lines &lt;ab&gt; and &lt;bg&gt;; one is perpendicular to the other one and let the two be the lines for which we want to find the two mean proportionals.</s>

<s id="A18-1.11.04">Let the position of the ruler be &lt;ebz&gt; and the two lines &lt;eh&gt; and &lt;hz&gt; be equal; then I say that the two lines &lt;az&gt; and &lt;ge&gt; are the two mean proportionals to &lt;ab&gt; and &lt;bg&gt;, &lt;ab&gt; being the first, &lt;za&gt; the second, &lt;ge&gt; the third and &lt;bg&gt; the fourth proportional.</s>
<s id="A18-1.11.05">Proof: because the quadrangle &lt;abgd&gt; is a rectangle, the four lines &lt;dh&gt;, &lt;ha&gt;, &lt;hb&gt; and &lt;hg&gt; are equal; and because line &lt;hd&gt; equals line &lt;ha&gt;, moreover the line &lt;hz&gt; is drawn,</s>

<s id="A18-1.24.12">That loads suspended in this manner remain balanced with one another in the inclination, Archimedes has proven in his works on balance in figures on which levers are used.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.13">Suspensions and supports show the same phenomena, because the suspension and the support of a force (or: and the support according to the force imposed?) are the same, for the supports that a load is put on are the ones that support the load.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.14">Such supports can be very numerous, even unlimited in number.As for the center of inclination, it is a single point in each of the bodies, towards which the lines that are perpendicular (to the horizon) from the points of suspension incline.Sometimes the centers of inclination also lie outside of the substance of an individual body, as is the case for wheels and rings.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.15">Now, that the lines of suspension meet at a common point will become clear to us if we imagine a plane standing perpendicular on the horizon and the same intersecting any body according to the balance.For we see that the body is divided by the plane into two halves; thus it goes through the body.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.16">If we now imagine another plane that intersects the body like that plane, then it penetrates it like that plane and the two planes intersect in one line.For if the line of intersection did not go through the point of suspension, then it would show that the same bodies would be in balance and not in balance.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.17">Let us now apply this conclusion to the supports.Let us imagine a body resting on a line that is perpendicular to a plane and let the body rest in balance of its parts on this line.If now this line is extended, then it goes through the body.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.18">For if the extended line falls outside of the body, then also the plane put through it falls outside of the same; that is, as we have just seen, impossible.Thus the line goes through the body and divides it into two parts that remain balanced.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.19">If we now assume as point of balance one that is different from this point, then we see here the same as with the first one, namely, that the line drawn through that point goes through the center of the body, so that the two lines are distant from one another.If now two planes are put through them, then those do not intersect; for one can put through two lines two planes that do not intersect.Thus here occurs the same as in the first case; thus it is not possible.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.20">From that you see that the planes intersect and the lines meet, so that they fall in one plane.If now this plane is pulled towards the surface of the body, then it makes, according to the points of intersection, a line.Then there is a third point falling outside of this line.</s>
<s id="A18-1.24.21">If we now assume this point also to be a point of balance, on which the body remains balanced, and draw a supporting line through this point, then this line, according to what we have said already, when it is drawn, will meet those two lines, through which the plane has been put, but not another point, except their point of intersection.For if any line meets two intersecting lines, but it lies on a different plane, then it meets them at their point of intersection.If however its meeting with the two does not occur at their point of intersection, then necessarily one part of the line lies on one plane and the rest on another one.Thus all lines that serve suspension unite at one point, namely the one that is called the point of inclination or center of gravity.</s>

<s id="A18-2.02.03">For, since the first thing that one needed if one wanted to move a body of excessive weight was to lift it off the ground in its motion, but one did not have any hold on it, to grip it, since all parts of its base were lying on the ground, so one necessarily thought of this procedure, made below the body a small pit in the ground, took a long [piece of] wood, put one end of it into that pit and pressed the other one downward; so the load rose.</s>

<s id="A18-2.03.05">But if we remove the rope from the load, tie one of its ends to a firm crossbeam, put the other one over a pulley that is attached to the middle of the load, and pull the rope, then it is easier to move that load.</s>

<s id="A18-2.05.08">We can also divide the side of the cylinder into any number of equal parts and describe a screw thread on each of them, so that many threads are formed on the cylinder and the cylinder becomes a screw.</s>

<s id="A18-2.05.17">Now we insert spokes into these holes and with them turn the screw, then the Tylos rises because of its motion in the groove, that is in the screw, and at the same time the rope rises, lifting the load that is fastened to it.</s>

<s id="A18-2.07.05">If we now suspend at the two points &lt;b&gt; and &lt;g&gt; equal weights, namely &lt;h&gt; and &lt;z&gt;, then it is clear that the circles do not incline to any side, since the weights &lt;z&gt; and &lt;h&gt; are equal and the spaces &lt;ba&gt; and &lt;ag&gt; are also equal, so &lt;bg&gt; is a scale beam that can be set in motion around the point of suspension, namely point &lt;a&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-2.07.06">If we now shift the weight at &lt;g&gt; and suspend it at &lt;e&gt;, then the load &lt;z&gt; will sink and set the circles in rotation.</s>
<s id="A18-2.07.07">If we however increase weight &lt;q&gt;, then it will again keep the balance of weight &lt;z&gt; and load &lt;q&gt; then relates to load &lt;z&gt; like the distance &lt;ba&gt; to the distance &lt;ae&gt; and we thus imagine the line &lt;be&gt; as a balance that can be set in motion around the point of suspension, namely point &lt;a&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-2.07.08">Archimedes has proven this in his work on the balancing of inclination.</s>
<s id="A18-2.07.09">From that it is evident that it is possible to move an immense bulk with a small force.</s>
<s id="A18-2.07.10">For if one has two circles around the same center and the bigger load is on any arc of the smaller one, the smaller on any arc of the larger one, if however the ratio of the line starting from the center of the larger circle to the one starting from the center of the smaller one is greater than the ratio of the big load to the small force that moves it, then the small force counterbalances the big load.</s>

<s id="A18-2.08.07">Let the lever be the line &lt;ab&gt; and the load to be moved by it, namely &lt;g&gt;, at point &lt;a&gt;, the moving force at point &lt;b&gt;, the stone [block] under the lever, on which it moves, at point &lt;d&gt; and let &lt;bd&gt; be greater than the line &lt;da&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-2.08.08">If we now lift the end of the lever that is at &lt;b&gt;, so that the lever arm rises above the stone [block], around which the lever rotates, then the load &lt;g&gt; moves towards the other side.</s>
<s id="A18-2.08.09">Then point &lt;b&gt; describes a circle around the center &lt;d&gt; and the point &lt;a&gt; around the same center a smaller circle than the one described by point &lt;b&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-2.08.10">If now line &lt;bd&gt; relates to &lt;da&gt; like the load &lt;g&gt; to the force at &lt;b&gt;, then the load &lt;g&gt; keeps the balance to the force &lt;b&gt;.</s>
<s id="A18-2.08.11">If the ratio &lt;bd&gt; : &lt;da&gt; is greater than that of the load to the force, then the force has the superior weight over the load, because two circles exist around the same center, the load is at the arc of the smaller circle, and the moving force is at the arc of the larger one.</s>

<s id="A18-2.13.05">If somebody now unties the one end of the rope tied at &lt;k&gt; and stands there himself and holds the rope, then he carries half the load and the whole load is twice the force that holds it.</s>
<s id="A18-2.13.06">From that it is evident that from the firm support at the tied end of the rope another force, which is equivalent to the one holding the other end of the rope, also pulls the load.</s>

<s id="A18-2.13.08">Consequently one can call the rope that is folded and divided into two parts and tightened simple and double pull.</s>
<s id="A18-2.13.09">Therefore it is clear now that the other end of the rope has to be fastened to a firm crossbeam and not to the load given for lifting, because a certain force from that firm support keeps the balance of the moving force and helps it with moving the load.</s>
<s id="A18-2.13.10">Thus it turns out that the load keeps the balance of a force equal to it if one end of the rope is tied to the load; if however the other end is fastened to a firm crossbeam, then the force keeps the balance of a load twice as big and the load can be moved by a lesser force than the first time.</s>

<s id="A18-2.16.02">First let us start by explaining what shows in screw threads.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.03">Thus we say: if we want to construct a screw, we take a strong hard [piece of] wood of the length corresponding to our purposes; let the part we want to make into a screw be turned and its density be even in all parts, so that its surface is a cylinder, and let us draw on its surface one side of the cylinder.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.04">Let us now divide this side into equal parts, corresponding to the height of the screw groove and let us assume in a plane two straight lines, one of which is perpendicular to the other one, and make one of them equal to the circumference of the cylinder, the other one according to the height of the screw groove, connect the two end points of the two lines through a line opposite to the right angle and make from thin brass a triangle equal (congruent) to this triangle, of such thinness that we can bend it as we want.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.05">After doing this, we put the side that is equal to the height of the screw groove on the first of the equal spaces that we have divided up on the side of the cylinder, then we wind the thin brass triangle around the cylindrical [piece of] wood and let the remaining acute angle of the triangle reach the right angle of the brass figure, because the baseline of the triangle equals the circumference of the cylinder.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.06">Then we tack together the two angles and draw the screw thread according to the line opposite the right angle.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.07">After that we turn the triangle to the second space and put the height of the triangle on the second space.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.08">In the same manner as before we draw also the second screw thread in immediate connection with the first one.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.09">We proceed in the same manner until we have drawn all spaces of the cylindrical [piece of] wood.</s>
<s id="A18-2.16.10">But since we needed, in using the screw, to put the [piece of] wood called Tylos into the first depression of the screw thread, and it is the one that lifts the load, thus this [piece of] wood rises at the rotation of the screw and the load rises with it.</s>
</p>
<p n="17">
<s id="A18-2.17.01">17 We have however to imagine the screw just as a twisted wedge, because the triangle which determines the screw thread has the form of a wedge; its head is the side that represents the height of the screw thread and the acute angle of the wedge is the remaining angle of the triangle, in which is the [piece of] wood called Tylos. Therefore the screw is a twisted, wound up wedge that does not have an effect by striking, but by its rotation. Turning here takes the place of the striking of a wedge, so it lifts the load. By lifting the load it has the opposite effect to the wedge, because the wedge only has an effect by penetrating into the inside and so moving the load, while the load remains in its place; the screw however is a twisted wedge that lifts the load towards itself while remaining in its place.</s>
<s id="A18-2.17.02">As it has been proven for the wedge that the one with the smaller angle moves the load by means of a lesser force than the one that moves the load by means of a wedge with a larger angle, we have to say as well for the screw in which the spaces between the screw threads are smaller that it moves the load easier than the screw in which the spaces between the threads are larger, because the smaller space causes a smaller angle. Therefore the screw whose threads are steeper moves the load by means of a bigger force, while the shallow screw moves the load by means of a smaller force.</s>

<s id="A18-2.19.06">If however the screw grooves in the screw threads are very steep, so that they are almost parallel to the side of the cylinder, then the [piece of] wood called Tylos holds back the rotation of the screw when a heavy load is suspended from it or a great force presses it, and causes a rotation opposite to the first one. From this it is evident that the screw can set the [piece of] wood called Tylos in motion as well as it can be set in motion by this [piece of] wood; it will move the [piece of] wood when the screw thread consists of threads that are close to each other; when the screw stops rotating the same remains in its position and the load remains suspended from it.</s>
<s id="A18-2.19.07">If, however, the screw threads are very steep and the Tylos does not stand still when the rotation of the screw stops, then it is this [piece of] wood which moves the screw, because, if a rope is attached to the place of the screw that does not have a thread and a weight is tied to this rope and the screw thread is very steep, we lift the weight too when we lift the [piece of] wood called Tylos; when we stop lifting the [piece of] wood, however, the weight is still and remains hanging; for this [piece of] wood resists the screw thread, if this thread is almost parallel to the side of the cylinder.</s>

<s id="A18-2.34.08">Why is the pulling of a wagon in sand hard for draught animals?</s>

<s id="A18-2.34.26">Why does a shot from the center of the string propel the arrow into a great distance?</s>

<s id="A18-2.34.33">Because, if one's knee is brought into a smaller distance (form one end) than the center, so that one of the two parts is shorter than the other one, then it is a balance divided into two unequal parts, which is why the hand that is further from the knee has the superior weight over the one closer to it.</s>

<s id="A18-2.34.37">Because in the long [piece of] wood great force is distributed over its parts so that the whole has the superior weight over its solid part, on which it rises.</s>
<s id="A18-2.34.38">Therefore, here the same phenomenon occurs as in a short [piece of] wood, when from its ends something is suspended that presses it down.</s>
<s id="A18-2.34.39">Thus the increase in length of the [piece of] wood corresponds to the weight that pulls down the shorter [piece of] wood. </s>

<s id="A18-2.34.44">In both cases the force is the same but the division of the pliers in its nail causes the hand to have the greater strength than the tooth; for it is a lever, at the greater part of which is the hand, and the space of the pliers makes the moving of the tooth easier.</s>
<s id="A18-2.34.45">For the root of the tooth is that around which the lever moves.</s>
<s id="A18-2.34.46">But since the space of the pliers is greater than the root of the tooth, around which something big moves, the hand outweighs the force resting in the root of the tooth.</s>

<s id="A18-2.34.52">But if we pull the balance to one of the two sides, then we lift a load, because the drop of the one scale pushes the other one up, so that its motion is not natural, I mean the motion upward of a load; for the natural motion is easy, namely the attraction downward of a weight.</s>

<s id="A18-3.02.06">If, however, that beam is not strong enough in itself, we have to consider the amount of the load that we want to lift, so that the force of the load does not become greater than the force of that support.</s>
<s id="A18-3.02.07">Thus we put the support perpendicular on a [piece of] wood in which it can move, and tie to the top of this support three or four ropes, pull them towards solid, firm supports and fasten them to them.</s>
<s id="A18-3.02.08">Then we attach to the end of the support pulleys that are tied to it with ropes, and fasten the ropes of the pulleys to the load that we want to lift.</s>

<s id="A18-3.02.10">If one now wants to bring a stone onto a wall or to any place, one unties the rope from one of the firm supports that hold the supporting beam that the pulleys are attached to, indeed on the side opposite to the one to which one wants to bring the stone, and the beam inclines towards that side; then one slowly lowers the rope on the pulley to the place, where one wants to put the stone.</s>
<s id="A18-3.02.11">If, however, one cannot incline the supporting beam that the pulleys are attached to so much as to let the lifted load reach the intended place, then we attach rollers underneath it, on which we let it run, or we drive it with levers so far, until we bring it to the intended place.</s>

<s id="A18-3.08.06">Let there be a ring or a hole at their top; then we put each of the two pegs into one side of the hollow and bring their inclined part into the inclined bulge, make a third peg of iron that we insert between the first two so it keeps them from shifting.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.07">Let the third peg also be drilled through at its upper end with a hole corresponding to the hole of the first two pegs.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.08">Then we insert into the three holes an axle, one of whose ends is thicker.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.09">Now the three pegs fill the hollow &lt;ezhq&gt; and the inclined (parts) of two pegs are in the bulge that is on both sides of the bed of the hollow, while the third fills the space between the first two; thus the three pegs look like a single body.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.10">Hereupon we fasten the ropes leading to a block and tackle to the axle that goes through the three pegs.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.11">Let there be on the upper part of the machine, by means of which we lift the load, a block and tackle parallel to the one attached to the stone; if we lead the ropes through it and tighten [them], the stone rises, because the middle peg does not let go of the two other ones whose inclined parts are stuck in the stone.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.12">Then one lifts it until it is opposite the place where we want to insert it, and lets it settle in this place.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.13">When the stone rests in its place the axle is taken out and the middle peg and then the two pegs with inclined sides are removed; hereupon we prepare another stone and proceed with it as before.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.14">In this procedure one has to take care not to use too hard iron, so it does not break; but one also has to beware of too soft [iron], so it does not curve and bend because of the weight of the stone, but one uses medium [iron], not too hard and not too soft.</s>
<s id="A18-3.08.15">One should also watch for a bend or fold in the iron, or a crack that could befall it during the work, for a fault in it is very dangerous, not only because the stone might fall, but also because it hits the workers when it falls.</s>

<s id="A18-3.09.04">Therefore one uses on the mountain, in the place where one wants to transport the stone [block] downhill, two tracks that one possibly levels off, and one takes two four-wheeled wagons, one of which one puts in the highest position of the track that one wants to transport the stone [block] on, the other one in the lowest position of the second track.</s>
<s id="A18-3.09.05">Then one attaches pulleys to a firm post between the two tracks, leads from the wagon that carries the stone [block] ropes over the pulleys and makes them go to the lower wagon.</s>
<s id="A18-3.09.06">This lower wagon one loads with small rocks that result from the cutting of the big block, until it is loaded with a weight (a little) less than that of the stone [block] that is to be transported down.</s>
<s id="A18-3.09.07">Hereupon one hitches up to this wagon draught animals that pull it upward and through the gradual climbing of this wagon the big stone [block] also moves easily and gradually downward.</s>

<s id="A18-3.13.05">The load is the net that is wound around the grapes to be pressed, and the moving force is the stone [block] that is suspended from the end of the pressing beam, called Lithos.</s>

<s id="A18-3.14.02">We proceed like this: We take a block and tackle and attach one pulley to the end of the Oros, the other one to the stone [block] (and lead a rope over the pulleys).</s>
<s id="A18-3.14.03">To the stone [block] we furthermore attach a crossbeam above the pulley, which is attached to the [piece of] wood called Oros (in order to suspend the stone [block] from the pressing beam, when it is lifted by means of the block and tackle).</s>
<s id="A18-3.14.04">Then we lead that rope to a shaft with the wheel, rotate the wheel, so that the rope winds up around the shaft and the stone [block] rises.</s>
</p>
<p n="15">
<s id="A18-3.15.01">15 We have yet another method to lower the [piece of] wood called Oros and to lift the stone [block] called Lithos.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.02">For the stiffness of the ropes causes a hindrance for the lowering of the [piece of] wood and the lifting of the stone [block], because the rope, if it is stiff, does not run over the pulleys, upward when lifting the stone [block] and downward when lowering the beam.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.03">When lifting the stone [block] we also have to use long spokes, in order to rotate the shaft with them.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.04">We are, however, when the grapes to be pressed that are lying under the beam, are very many, or the people who turn the shaft that the rope is on are of greater number, not safe from breaking individual spokes, so that (the stone [block]) falls down and so an accident happens to them or so that they (the spokes) slip out of the hole, so that (the stone [block]) also falls and the same accident would happen to them.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.05">So one has found a different method for which no rope is necessary, which is easier and safer.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.06">Its description is the following.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.07">We use a square body of wood that looks like a brick* and attach it underneath the beam called Oros in the place where the rope was.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.08">The one of its parts that is directed upward we make curved and on both sides of the firm support we attach impediments (?) that are fastened to the beam called Oros, so that this brick does not run further than is necessary, but still can move to both sides.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.09">Then we lift the pressing beam as high as possible, in order to put the grapes under it, measure the distance between the brick and the stone [block], take half of that or a little more and make according to this length an evenly thick, lentil-shaped screw.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.10">But let the screw thread on the one side not go to the end of the screw wood; but on the other side the thread has to reach the end of the screw wood.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.11">The protruding part of the wood we make square and cut into this square a hollow, called Tormos.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.12">That is a circular hole, which is drilled into the end of the [piece of] wood, so that this [piece of] wood can be joined with the [piece of] wood (the brick), with which it is to be connected.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.13">Then we add this Tormos to one of the sides of the brick that are lying under the pressing beam, take iron cross nails, insert their ends into this hole and nail the rest of them to the brick.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.14">Now we use an iron axle, which we insert into this Tormos, let it go to the brick and fasten it to it, so that it increases the strength of the bond with the brick.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.15">Hereupon we take another square piece of strong hard wood, of the same length as the screw; let its width, which is determined by one of the sides of the square of its base, be as much larger as the diameter of the screw cylinder, so that we can insert this cylinder into the interior of this square [piece of] wood.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.16">Then we split it lengthwise, make a round, canal-like groove into each of the two parts, in order to make from it  a nut, cut the screw thread, so that the bolt can be inserted.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.17">Then we (re)connect the two parts, so that they become one piece.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.18">The thread has also in the nut wood to go on one side to the end of the [piece of] wood; on the other end one leaves it undrilled, solid.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.19">If we now insert the end of the screw into the end of the hollowed [piece of] wood, whose thread goes to its outermost (edge), and the screw is turned, then it goes completely into the hollowed [piece of] wood, until it disappears entirely.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.20">When we have done this, we cut at the end of this [piece of] wood that is hollowed on the inside on its neck at a short distance from the end a circle (a), and put an iron ring (c) on it, as one does with wagon axles.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.21">Then we carve into the stone [block] a hole (c), so wide, that the end of this [piece of] wood (a, d) fits inside and we can easily rotate it inside.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.22">Now we insert the end of the [piece of] wood into this hole and attach iron hooks (f, f) to it (the stone [block]), which prevent the [piece of] wood from slipping out of the hollow in the stone [block].</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.23">To the circle that is carved into the end of the [piece of] wood we also attach an iron ring (d), so that it can be rotated more easily.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.24">Above this end that is set into the stone [block] we make two holes opposite to each other, from which protrude the four ends of two spokes.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.25">When we have done this and want to use the beam called Oros, we approach the two ends of the screw and the [piece of] wood that is hollowed inside to one another.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.26">Then the four spokes are turned, until the screw penetrates into the hollow, the beam is pushed down, the stone [block] rises and so everything under the beam is pressed out.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.27">When the stone [block] has been lowered so far that it sits on the ground, we turn in the opposite (direction), so the beam rises, while the stone [block] remains lying.</s>
<s id="A18-3.15.28">This procedure is strong and sound, with a secure outcome (safe) and without much effort.</s>

<p n="16">
<s id="A18-3.16.01">16 Some have thought of inventing different kinds of pressing tools; instead of the net that was wound around the grapes to be pressed and the baskets, into which one puts the olives after an incision (?) has been made on them, and that one brings under the Oros, they have made an instrument from wood, that is called Galeagra.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.02">This one fills with any [kind of] material, puts it under the beam called Oros and lowers the beam down on it.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.03">Through this one gets a wide space for what one wants to press and the work is made easier.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.04">The manufacture of the Galeagra occurs in two ways.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.05">One of them is assembled and completed according to the following procedure.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.06">One takes wood of strong and hard consistency and makes from it slats in the length of the instrument one wants to make.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.07">Let their width measure two spans and their thickness six fingers.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.08">Then we carve on both ends of each slat, on both sides, after leaving six fingers wide free, a notch in the upper part and let it penetrate into the depth of the slat for a quarter of its thickness.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.09">The same we do on the lower side, so that the rest of the thickness of the wood is half.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.10">The notches in the slats have to be regular, so that one fits into the other.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.11">Then we assemble the slats so that from the assembling of all an equilateral, square, box-like frame is formed.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.12">The inner joins between the slats have to be wide, so that the fluids drain quickly.</s>
<s id="A18-3.16.13">In this tool the [piece of] wood that is lying on top of the grapes and the boards that are stacked above it, do not have to be very thick, because, when the grapes are pressed, (by putting on new boards), depending on the amount of what has already been pressed out, they jut out beyond the slats so that those do not become a hindrance.</s>
</p>
<p n="17">
<s id="A18-3.17.01">17 As now for the other Galeagra, the connection of its walls*) with one another is established by three crossbeams on each of them.</s>
<s id="A18-3.17.02">On the sides of these three crossbeams there has to be a protrusion that is fitted with a notch extending to the middle of its thickness, so that the four walls are firmly joined, when they are assembled.</s>
<s id="A18-3.17.03">Also in this tool the joins have to be wide and on top of the uppermost board a piece of wood has to be put, which, according to what was just said, protrudes on top, so that the pressing beam does not touch part of the grapes, but the wood block drops to the bottom of the Galeagra.</s>

<s id="A18-3.18.01">18 Now we want to discuss the manufacture of the presses that press strongly and powerfully, and we want to state the difference that exists between the tools already mentioned and the following ones, which are among the strongest and most perfect that exist.</s>
<s id="A18-3.18.02">First we explain the difference between them and then we describe their manufacture.</s>
<s id="A18-3.18.03">So we say that the beam called Oros is nothing but a lever that is pressed down by a weight.</s>
<s id="A18-3.18.04">The weight that presses on it is located on the one of its ends that is raised off the ground.</s>

<s id="A18-3.18.07">Therefore one has to repeat the turning and pressing from time to time.</s>
<s id="A18-3.18.08">With the beam called Oros, however, the stone [block] alone, when it is suspended and then released, exerts the pressure, and a constant repetition of the pressing is not necessary.</s>
<s id="A18-3.18.09">That is the difference between the tools.</s>

<s id="A18-3.19.04">Their manufacture is done in the way that we are going to explain now.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.05">We take a square [piece of] wood of six spans of length; let its width be no less than two feet, and its thickness no less than one foot.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.06">Let this [piece of] wood be of a strong kind, not too soft and not too dry, but of medium (quality).</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.07">We call it a "table".</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.08">We now put the table flat down and drill on its two edges, in equal distance, two deep, round holes.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.09">Into each hole we put two locking wooden bars (b, b) that protrude into the depth of the table.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.10">Let their two ends be arcs that meet, so that a small circle is formed, which is smaller than the drilled circular holes.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.11">Let these two locking wooden bars be cut obliquely, so that, when they are inserted, they stay firm and do not give way.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.12">Then we take two hard, square, ruler-straight [pieces of] wood, of equal thickness and width; one of their heads we leave, for an adequate space, square.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.13">We take the edges of the remaining part of the two [pieces of] wood and curve them with a file and construct on them a screw of even thickness.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.14">To the end of the screw wood that we have left square we attach a disc with four holes, into which we insert four spokes.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.15">Let run around the other end of the two [pieces of] wood a rough circular cut that is removed from the end as far as the round hole, that we have drilled into the table (d), is deep.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.16">Let the diameter of this circle equal half the diameter of the circle of the base of the screw.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.17">When this has happened, we insert the end (a) of the screw, in which is the carved circle, into the round hole in the table.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.18">Then we drive the blocking woods (b, b), that we have made [with wedges (c, c)], until they penetrate into the carved circle and are stuck in it and thus do not let the screw slip out.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.19">In the same manner we proceed with the screw that goes to the other end of the table.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.20">Now we take a long, square [piece of] wood of the length of the lower [piece of] wood, into which the screws are inserted.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.21">In this [piece of] wood there are two circles that go into the wood and through to the other side, in the same position as the two circular hollows, in which the ends of the screw are sitting.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.22">Let there be a screw thread on the interior of these two circular openings, so that they form the nuts, so that, when the two screws are turned, the [piece of] wood drops and rises in the same way when the screws are turned to the other side.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.23">How one manufactures the nut, however, we are going to explain in the following.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.24">The length and thickness of this [piece of] wood has, as I said, to have the measurements of length and thickness of the table; its width has to be one quarter less [than the width of the table].</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.25">Hereupon we make a square, right-angled foot for the table, whose lower part looks like a step and whose length is a little greater than the width of the table, so that the entire tool firmly stands on it.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.26">We have to give the middle of this foot an adequate groove and the middle of the table with a tenon corresponding to the groove and insert it into that, so that it sits very firmly.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.27">Then we set up on the table, between the two screws, four interconnected walls of thin boards, that are less than one finger thick; let the length and width of the square between these boards be such that, when the Galeagra comes into its center, there remains a free space between the two, surrounding the Galeagra, in which the fluid flows. </s>
<s id="A18-3.19.28">In the center of the table we have to make a pit, as wide as the base of the Galeagra that touches the table, i.e., it has to fit into it and we insert the Galeagra into this pit.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.29">Then we put a thick board on top that fills it (width-wise) and on top of it a piece of wood of lesser length and width than the board, but so thick that it fills the Galeagra (depth-wise).</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.30">Then we turn the screws by means of the spokes that are on the discs, until the [piece of] wood, in which are the nuts, drops to the piece of wood.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.31">Then the piece of wood is pressed and the piece of wood presses the board inside the Galeagra and presses out the body in the Galeagra and the fluid drains.</s>
<s id="A18-3.19.32">Then one turns the screw towards the other side, so that the [piece of] wood rises, the piece of wood is removed and the object to be pressed is exchanged, until all of its fluid is out.</s>

<s id="A18-3.20.03">Let the nut be in the center of this [piece of] wood.</s>
<s id="A18-3.20.04">Then we insert the screw into this hole and turn it by means of the spokes that are in the disc, until the screw drops to the board that has been laid on top of the Galeagra, presses it, and the fluid drains.</s>
<s id="A18-3.20.05">One has to repeat the pressing a number of times, until there is no fluid left in the body to be pressed.</s>
<s id="A18-3.20.06">There still are many other kinds of presses, describing which does not appear good to us, however, because their use is frequent and usual among the people, although in effect they are inferior to the ones mentioned by us.</s>

<p n="21">
<s id="A18-3.21.01">21 The nut now is manufactured in the following way.</s>

<s id="A18-3.21.05">On the other side we remove by turning the amount of the thickness of the screw grooves, so that the [piece of] wood becomes like an evenly thick peg (e, e).</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.06">Then we draw the diameter of the base of the [piece of] wood and divide it into three equal parts.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.07">In one of the two dividing points we erect a perpendicular on the diameter.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.08">Then we draw from the end (points) of this line that is perpendicular to the diameter, on the entire length of the peg, two straight lines (ty, uz).</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.09">We achieve this by putting the peg on a straight board and furrowing it with pliers, until we reach the thread.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.10">Then we carefully use a fine saw and saw it through to the thread.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.11">Then we detach the marked third (utzy) from the peg and carve into the center of the two remaining parts a canal-like groove (fghi) on the entire length, half as deep as the remaining thickness.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.12">Then we take an iron rod (lknm) and turn it according to the screw threads.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.13">Hereupon we attach it to the peg (ee), in which is the groove, and let its (blunt) end approach the thread (of wood ending in u), after having firmly connected the two pieces (the sawed off one and the hollowed one), so that one adheres to the other and there remains absolutely no space between them.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.14">Then we take a small wedge (opqrvw), insert it into the canal-like groove and hit it, until it drives out the iron rod and falls between the two parts.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.15">Having done this, we insert the screw into a drilled [piece of] wood (&lt;z&gt;, &lt;z&gt;), in which is a completely straight hole measuring the same as the thickness of the screw (dd).</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.16">Then we drill into the walls of this wide hole small holes, placed side by side, insert into them small, oblique plugs (&lt;h&gt;) and let these penetrate so far until they mesh with the thread of the screw.*) </s>
<s id="A18-3.21.17">Then we take the [piece of] wood (T), into which we want to drill the nut thread, drill a hole (&lt;ee&gt;) corresponding to the screw peg (ee) into it and connect this [piece of] wood with the one into which we have inserted the screw, by two posts that we fasten completely.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.18">Then we insert the peg (&lt;g&gt;), in which is the wedge, into the hole (&lt;ee&gt;), which is in the [piece of] wood (T) that is to be drilled to [form] a nut thread, drill into the upper end (&lt;b&gt;) of the screw holes, into which we insert spokes, and turn it, until it (the peg &lt;g&gt;) penetrates into the wood.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.19">We do not stop turning it up and down and driving the wedge  again and again,**) until the  nut thread is drilled as we intended.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.20">Then we have drilled the nut threads.</s>
<s id="A18-3.21.21">and this is the shape, and with its completion the book is completed (TB) </s>
