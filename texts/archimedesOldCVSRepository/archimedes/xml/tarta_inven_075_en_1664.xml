<lb/>greate&longs;t part of woods are lighter, or le&longs;s grave than the water; he 
<lb/>therefore that &longs;hall build a Ship or other Ve&longs;&longs;el meerly of wood,

<lb/>its a thing very clear, that all that &longs;ame Body, compounded of wood 
<lb/>and of water, would be much lighter than if it were all only of water 
<lb/>without wood: Such a compound Body therefore being le&longs;s grave 
<lb/>than the water, its nece&longs;&longs;ary (for the rea&longs;ons above produced) that 
<lb/>a part of the &longs;ame remain above the Surface of the water.</s></p><p type="main">

<s>And if the &longs;aid Ship or Bark &longs;hall be built (as it is u&longs;ual) with 
<lb/>Bolts, Nailes, and other Materials of Iron, and that &longs;uch Iron&shy;
<lb/>works be not of &longs;uch quantity, as to make that Body compounded 
<lb/>of wood and Iron, graver than the water, but that it continue &longs;till 
<lb/>le&longs;s grave than the water (as I judge all Ships and Barks to be;) The 
<lb/>&longs;ame will follow as did before, namely, that filling the &longs;aid Ship 
<lb/>with water, as full as is po&longs;ible, it cannot by any means go to the 
<lb/>bottom If then a Ship or other Ve&longs;&longs;el being wholly fill'd with 
<lb/>water, cannot be thereby &longs;unk to the bottom; It is a thing evident, 
<lb/>that if &longs;uch a Ship or Ve&longs;&longs;el &longs;hall be totally fill'd with a Matter 
<lb/>lighter than the water; not only its totall &longs;inking under that weight <pb xlink:href="075/01/007.jpg" pagenum="485"/>will be impo&longs;&longs;ible, but al&longs;o its floating in &longs;ome part above the Sur&shy;
<lb/>face of the water will be nece&longs;&longs;ary: And &longs;o much the greater part 
<lb/>&longs;hall be vi&longs;ible above the water, by how much the Matter of the 
<lb/>Lading, is lighter than the water.</s></p><p type="main">

<s>Therefore, if all the Cargo of a Ship (for in&longs;tance) Buts of Oyl, 
<lb/>and that no other Matters of a graver Nature than water were intro&shy;
<lb/>duced, and that the &longs;aid Ship &longs;hould by &longs;ome Accident be filled 
<lb/>up with water, it is not only manife&longs;t that the Ship cannot be there&shy;
<lb/>by &longs;unk to the bottom, but that a part thereof mu&longs;t nece&longs;&longs;arily float 
<lb/>above the Surface of the water: Becau&longs;e all that Compo&longs;ition of 
<lb/>Wood, Water and Oyl, would be lighter than if it had been all 
<lb/>&longs;imply of water. </s><s>The very &longs;ame would follow, if the Cargo had 
<lb/>been &longs;oley of Wine, Wax, Camphor, Spices, or the like Matters, 
<lb/>lighter than the water. </s><s>But becau&longs;e the Merchandizes that fraight 
<lb/>Ships, or other Ve&longs;&longs;els, are &longs;ome (&longs;pecifically) graver, and &longs;ome 
<lb/>(&longs;pecifically) lighter than the water: (The graver are all forts of 
<lb/>Mettals, as Iron, Tinn, Lead, Bra&longs;s, Copper, Silver, Gold, and infi&shy;
<lb/>nite other Species of Commodities; likewi&longs;e the per&longs;ons of Men, 
<lb/>Stones, Balla&longs;ts, and the like:) And that al&longs;o there are &longs;ome &longs;orts of 
<lb/>Commodities that chance to differ very little in Gravity from the 
<lb/>water: Therefore I conclude, that as oft as any Ship accidentally 
<lb/>is fill'd with water, and &longs;o &longs;inks by degrees to the bottom, it is ne&shy;
<lb/>ce&longs;&longs;ary to grant that all the Compo&longs;ition, namely, of the Fraight, 
<lb/>of the Ve&longs;&longs;el, and of the water that entered into it, is more grave, 
<lb/>than if the compo&longs;ition had been all &longs;imply of water, by the rea&longs;ons 
<lb/>before alledg'd.</s></p><p type="main">

<s>And therefore in &longs;uch a ca&longs;e things graver than the water, mu&longs;t 
<lb/>of nece&longs;&longs;ity exceed in force tho&longs;e that be lighter: and by how much 
<lb/>things graver than the water, exceed the lighter, &longs;o much the more 
<lb/>Force will be required to recover &longs;uch a Ship or other Ve&longs;&longs;el being 
<lb/>&longs;unk, and on the contrary, &longs;o much le&longs;s Force will be required, 
<lb/>when the Ma&longs;s of the Materials more grave than the water, &longs;hall 
<lb/>not differ much from the Ma&longs;s of the le&longs;s grave: provided the Re&shy;
<lb/>covery be undertaken in &longs;ome &longs;hort time after the Ship &longs;hall be &longs;unk, 
<lb/>For if the Ship lie many dayes under water, the delay will intro. 
<lb/></s><s>duce many difficulties: One will be, that it will con&longs;olidate with 
<lb/>and dock or work it &longs;elf farther into the Mudd or Sand, which will 
<lb/>not a little hinder its Recovery; and again, the water will continu&shy;
<lb/>ally carry into the &longs;aid Ship, Ouze, Mudd, and Sand, which Mat&shy;
<lb/>ter is much graver than the water, whereby the Ship is continually 
<lb/>made graver as to the water, than it was at the beginning when it 
<lb/>was fir&longs;t &longs;ubmerg'd. </s><s>And moreover the corruptible Matters, which 
<lb/>are by nature lighter than the water, will corrupt, and corrupting 
<lb/>will change into other earthy &longs;ub&longs;tances much graver than the 


<pb xlink:href="075/01/008.jpg" pagenum="486"/>water: in&longs;omuch that at the length, it ought to be pre&longs;uppo&longs;ed in 
<lb/>order to the recovery of the &longs;aid Ship, as if it were &longs;olely laden 
<lb/>with Mire, Dirt, and Sand: which doing, you will not be deceived 
<lb/>in the operation, that is to &longs;ay, preparing and working with a Force 
<lb/>equivalent to that its Gravity. </s><s>The way to know how to prepare

<s>Now to give beginning to the bu&longs;ine&longs;s propo&longs;ed, I &longs;ay, that 
<lb/>in the Recovery of a Foundred Ship laden, or any other la&shy;

<lb/>e&longs;pecially the&longs;e three great Ob&longs;tructions. </s><s>The fir&longs;t difficulty is, how 
<lb/>to imbreech and grapple it with &longs;uch, and &longs;o many Ropes, as may 
<lb/>&longs;uffice to bear it up; for if this either by ill chance cannot be done 
<lb/>(whether through its being in a place two deep, or too far dockt in 
<lb/>the Mudd or Sand) all our other labour will be fru&longs;trate and vain.</s></p><p type="main">
<s>The &longs;econd difficulty, when once it is grappled, is how with dex&shy;
<lb/>terity to &longs;eperate it from the bottom of the Sea; and this difficulty 
<lb/>will be much greater, the Ship being in a Miry or Sandy bottom, 
<lb/>than if it &longs;hall be in a Stony place; and it &longs;hall be al&longs;o a greater 
<lb/>difficulty to &longs;eperate it from a very deep bottom, than from a Shal&shy;
<lb/>low; (alwayes &longs;uppo&longs;ing that the two bottoms be both alike, name&shy;
<lb/>ly, either both Stony or both Sandy;) and al&longs;o far greater &longs;hall the 
<lb/>&longs;aid difficulty be in a Ship long &longs;unk, than in one newly four dered; 
<lb/>(as we have already &longs;aid in the precedent Explanation:) But when 
<lb/>&longs;he is once water-born, or &longs;eperated from the bottom, its an ca&longs;ie 
<lb/>matter to rai&longs;e her up to the Surface of the water; for then &longs;he &longs;hall 
<lb/>not be a little aleviated in her Gravity: But the truth is, the draw&shy;
<lb/>ing of it after wards above the Superficies of the water, is no very ca&shy;
<lb/>&longs;ie matter, but is extream hard to be done; and this is the third

<lb/>were very ob&longs;cure, it is manife&longs;t that &longs;o little a light as that &longs;poke 
<lb/>of in the precedent Explanation would hardly &longs;erve. </s><s>And therefore 
<lb/>if you would convey thither one much bigger, you may do it &longs;eve&shy;
<lb/>rall wayes, of which one is this. </s><s>Take nine ounces of refined Salt&shy;
<lb/>peter, &longs;ix ounces (Greek weight) of Brim&longs;tone that is clear and 
<lb/>tran&longs;parent, three ounces of Camphire refined, and one ounce of 
<lb/>Ma&longs;tick; and beat all the&longs;e things &longs;everally, not very &longs;mall; and 
<lb/>when you have beaten them, mix them all together in an Earthen 
<lb/>Pan; and when they are well mingled, put thereto three pounds of 
<lb/>common Gunpowder, and then remingle them very well together; 
<lb/>and afterwards put therein four ounces of oyl of Stone, and mix all 
<lb/>very well; and this done, take a Cartredge thereof, and give fire to 
<lb/>it; and if it burn too &longs;lowly, put a little more Gunpowder to it, 
<lb/>but if it burn too vehemently and &longs;uddenly, add thereto more oyl. 
<lb/></s><s>Put this Compo&longs;ition, after this, into a little Bag of double Canvis, 
<lb/>of &longs;uch a widene&longs;&longs;e, that when all the mixture is out, therein it may 
<lb/>be as broad, as high, and cram the Compo&longs;ition hard down into the 
<lb/>Bag; and then with very good Pack thread &longs;ew up the mouth of the 
<lb/>Sack, cutting away the &longs;uperfluous Canvas. </s><s>Then winde a good 
<lb/>hempen cord round about it very hard every way, reducing it to the 
<lb/>form of a round Ball, and after it is very well bound and &longs;wathed a&shy;
<lb/>bout many &longs;everall times, you mu&longs;t melt Brim&longs;tone into a great Ve&longs;&shy;
<lb/>&longs;el, and when it is melted, roll the &longs;aid Ball therein &longs;o, as that it may 
<lb/>be covered all over with a cru&longs;t of Brim&longs;tone. </s><s>And this being done 


<pb xlink:href="075/01/038.jpg" pagenum="516"/>affix a piece of Lead unto the Ball by an iron Wire, and make it ve&shy;
<lb/>ry fa&longs;t, and frame in the top of the Ball a Bow or Noo&longs;e with the 
<lb/>&longs;aid Wire, and to that fa&longs;ten a long Rope, and then in the oppo&longs;ite 
<lb/>place where the Lead is fixed, make an hole with an iron rod into 
<lb/>the middle of the Ball, and &longs;top that hole with a little fine Gunpow&shy;
<lb/>der, holding it &longs;u&longs;pended by the Rope: and when you would have 
<lb/>that Light de&longs;cend into the bottome of the Sea or Gulph, goe to the 
<lb/>place, and give fire to the little hole, and when it is inkindled, let 
<lb/>down the Ball and Lead, lengthwayes, almo&longs;t to the bottome, where 
<lb/>he &longs;hall be that would find the thing &longs;unk, and you &longs;hall find that 
<lb/>the &longs;aid fire will illuminate very much round about the &longs;aid bottom, 
<lb/>and &longs;hall la&longs;t a long time, and more or le&longs;s, according to the hole 
<lb/>made in the Ball. 'Tis to be noted, that the Ball is to be held over 
<lb/>the head of him that diveth, for that the &longs;moke proceeding from it 
<lb/>will much ob&longs;cure the Waters above it, &longs;o as that it will give Light 
<lb/>only downwards; and this fire will be a dreadful &longs;ight unto the Fi&longs;h, 
<lb/>&longs;o that they will fly from &longs;o new a &longs;pectacle.</s></p><p type="head">
