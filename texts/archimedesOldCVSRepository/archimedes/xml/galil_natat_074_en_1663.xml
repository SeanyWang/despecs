<lb/></s><s>I replied, that any piece of Ice, of what&longs;oever Figure, &longs;wims upon 
<lb/>the Water, a manife&longs;t &longs;igne, that its being never &longs;o flat and broad, 
<lb/>hath not any part in its floating: and added, that it was a manife&longs;t

<lb/>to the botome of the Water, &longs;uddenly return to flote atoppe, which

<lb/>Forme, unable to penetrate the Re&longs;i&longs;tance of the <emph type="italics"/>Medium,<emph.end type="italics"/> that 
<lb/>would be altogether impo&longs;&longs;ible; I concluded therefore, that the Figure 
<lb/>was in &longs;ort a Cau&longs;e of the Natation or Submer&longs;ion of Bodies, 
<lb/>but the greater or le&longs;&longs;e Gravity in re&longs;pect of the Water: and there&shy;
<lb/>fore all Bodyes heavier than it of what Figure &longs;oever they be, indiffe&shy;
<lb/>rently go to the bottome, and the lighter, though of any figure, float

<lb/>wi&longs;e, were induced to that beliefe, by &longs;eeing how that diver&longs;ity 
<lb/>of Formes or Figures, greatly altereth the Velo&longs;ity, and Tardity 
<lb/>of Motion; &longs;o that Bodies of Figure broad and thin, de&longs;cend 
<lb/>far more lea&longs;urely into the Water, than tho&longs;e of a more compacted 
<lb/>Figure, though both made of the &longs;ame Matter: by which &longs;ome 
<lb/>might be induced to believe that the Dilatation of the Figure might 
<lb/>reduce it to &longs;uch amplene&longs;&longs;e that it &longs;hould not only retard but wholly 
<lb/>impede and take away the Motion, which I hold to be fal&longs;e. </s><s>Upon
