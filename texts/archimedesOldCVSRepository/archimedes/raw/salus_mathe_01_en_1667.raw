S^{t.} JOHN DENHAM
Knight of the Noble Order of the
BATH,
And Surveyor General of his Ma^{ties} Works, &amp;c.</head>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>I humbly begge your Pardon for
bringing this Book under your Pro-
tection. Were it a Work of my
own, or I any thing but the Tran$la-
tour, I should ma$ter my Thoughts to a meaner
Dedication; But being a Collection of $ome of
the greate$t Ma$ters in the World, and never
made English till now, I conceived I might
$ooner procure their Welcome to a per$on $o
eminent for Noble Candor, as well as for all
tho$e Intellectual Excellencies wherewith
Your Rich Soulis known to be furnished. I
re$olv'd to be as kind to this Book as I could,
<foot>and</foot>
<pb>
and $eriou$ly con$idering which way to effect
it, I at la$t concluded to prefix Your Name,
whom His Maje$ty and all his Subjects, (who
have a higher Sen$e and Judgement of Excel-
lent Parts) know be$t able to defend my Im-
perfections. And yet I confe$s there's one
thing makes again$t me, which is your eminent
Integrity and great Affection to Truth, where-
by my Lap$esin a Work of this Nature might
ju$tly de$pair of Shelter, but that the Excel-
lency of Your Native Candor $trives for Pre-
dominancy over all Your great Abilities. For
'tis all-mo$t impo$$ible to think what Your
Matchle$s Wit is not able to Conquer, would
Your known Mode$ty but give leave: there-
fore <I>Galileus, Kepler,</I> and tho$e other worthies
in Learning are now brought before You in
English Habit, having chang'd their Latine,
Italian and French, whereby they were almo$t
Strangers to our Nation, unle$s to $uch as You,
who $o perfectly ma$ter the Originals. I know
you have $o much and great imployment for
His Maje$ty, and his good Subjects that I shall
not robb you of another Minutes lo$s; be$ides
the liberty of $ub$cribing my Self;</P>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P><I>Your Honours</I></P>
<P>Mo$t Humble
and
Mo$t obedient Servant</P>
<P>THOMAS SALUSBURY.</P>
<pb>
<P>READER,</P>
<P>Mathematical Learning <I>(to $peak nothing touching the nece$sity &amp; delight thereof) hath bin $o $paring-
ly imparted to our Countrymen in their native Engli$h, e$pecially the nobler and $ublimer part,
that in Compliance with the</I> Solicitations <I>of $everal of my noble and learned Friends, and the</I> Incli-
nations <I>of $uch as are Mathematically di$po$ed, more e$pecially tho$e, who either want Time or
Patience to look into the vulgar and un$tudied Languages, I did adventure upon this Work of Collecting &amp; Tran$-
lating from among$t the excellent Pieces that are $o abounding in the Italian and French Tongues, $ome of tho$e
that my own ob$ervation and the intimation of Friends were mo$t u$efull and de$ired, and with all mo$t wanting
in their Own.</I></P>
<P><I>I was, indeed, at fir$t $eriou$ly Con$cious, and am now, by experience, fully convinced how di$proportionate the
weight of the Enterprize is to the weakne$s of the Vndertaker, but yet the Pa$sion I ever had to be $ub$ervient to
my Friends and Compatriots in their Inqui$ition after the$e Sublime Studies, and a Patience which I owe to the
Flegme that is predominant in my Con$titution, joyned with a nine-years conver$ence in the$e Languages, as al$o an
unhappy and long Vacation that the per$ecutions of the late Tyrants gave me from more advantagious employ-
ments $o prevailed with me, that I re$olved to improve even my very Confinement to $erve tho$e Friends, whom, as
the Times then $tood, I could not $ee.</I></P>
<P><I>The Book being for Subject and De$ign intended chiefly for Gentlemen, I have hin as carele$s of u$ing a $tudied
Pedantry in my Style; as careful in contriving a plea$ant and beautiful Impre$$ion. And when I had con$idered
the hazard, and computed the charge of the undertaking, I found it to exceed the ability of a private Pur$e, e$pe-
cially of mine, that had bin $o lately emptied by the hand of violent enemies, and perfidious friends; not to
make mention here of the Sums that a Loyal Reflexion upon my Princes Affairs had at the $ame time drawn
from me; and judg'd that the most $afe, ea$y, and rea$onable way was to invite tho$e Per$ons who had appeared
de$irous of the Book, to be contributary to their own Contentment, by $ub$cribing towards the charge of this Pu-
blication.</I></P>
<P><I>And for the better management of the Work, I joyned to my $elf a Printer, who$e Genius having rendered
him Mathematical, and my overtures of profit having intere$$ed his diligence, I was induced to promi$e my $elf a
more than common A$$i$tance from him: and at his door I with rea$on lay all mi$carriages that concerns his
Profe$$ion in the Bu$ine$s.</I></P>
<P><I>In this Work I found more than ordinary Encouragement from that publick $pirited Per$on the Reverend and
Learned Dr.</I> Thomas Barlow, <I>Provo$t of Queens Colledge Oxford, and</I> Margaret <I>Profe$$or in that Vniver-
$ity, as al$o from tho$e two able Mathematicians and my Reall Friends Major</I> Miles Symner, <I>and Mr.</I> Robert
Wood <I>of Trinity Colledge</I> Dublin, <I>and $ome few others who$e Mode$ty hath expre$ly enjoin'd me a concealment
of their Names.</I></P>
<P><I>Well, at length I have got to the end of my fir$t Stage; and if I have not rid Po$t, let my excu$e be that my long
$tay for my Warrant cau$ed me to $et out late; and being ill mounted, and in a road full of rubbs, I could not with
any $afety go fa$ter; but hope to get it up in the next Stage, for in that I intend to $hift my Hor$es.</I></P>
<P><I>The names of tho$e Authors and Treatices which I judged would mo$t grace our Language, and gratify Stu-
dents, are particularly expre$t in the General Title of the two Tomes. Di$tinct Tomes they are as con$i$ting of
$everat Pieces: Collections I call them, becau$e they have bin $o publi$hed, di$per$t, and worn out of Print, that
they very rarely meet in one hand: and Tran$lations I own them to be, as not pretending to any thing more than
the di$po$ure and conver$ion of them: tho$e Tracts only excepted which compo$e the $econd Part of the $econd
Tome.</I></P>
<P><I>The fir$t Book which offers it $elf to your view in this Tome is that $ingular and unimitable Piece of Rea$on
and Demon$tration the Sy$teme of</I> Galilco. <I>The $ubject of it is a new and Noble port of A$tronomy, to wit the
Doctrine and Hypothe$is of the Mobility of the carth and the Stability of the Sun; the Hi$tory whereof I $hall
hereafter give you at large in the Life of that famous Man. Only this by the by; that the Reader may not wonder
why the$e Dialogues found $o various entertainment in Italy (for he cannot but have heard that though they have
been with all veneration valued, read &amp; applauded by the Iudicious yet they were with much dete$tation per$ecuted,
$uppre$$ed &amp; exploded by the Super$titious) I am to tell him that our Author having a$$igned his intimate Friends</I>
Salviati <I>and</I> Sagredo <I>the more $ucce&szlig;full Parts of the Challenger, and Moderater, he made the famous Commen-
tator</I> Simplicius <I>to per$onate the Peripatetick. The Book coming out, and Pope</I> Urban <I>the</I> VIII. <I>taking his Ho-
nour to be concern'd as having in his private Capacity bin very po$itive in declaiming against the Samian Philo-
$ophy, and now (as he $uppo$ed) being ill delt with by</I> Galilco <I>who had $ummed up all his Arguments, and pur
them into the mouth of</I> Simplicius; <I>his Holine$s thereupon conceived an implacable Di$plea$ure against our Au-
thor, and thinking no other revenge $ufficient, he employed his Apo$tolical Authority, and deals with the Con$i$tory
to condemn him and pro$cribe his Book as Heretical; pro$tituting the Cen$ure of the Church to his private revenge.
This was</I> Galilco's <I>fortune in</I> Italy: <I>but had I not rea$on to hope that the Engli$h will be more ho$pitable, on the
account of that Principle which induceth them to be civil to (I $ay not to dote on) Strangers, I $hould fear to be
charged with imprudence for appearing an Interpreter to that great Philo$opher. And in this confidence I $hall
forbear to make any large Exordium concerning him or his Book: &amp; the rather in regard that $uch kind of Gau-
deries become not the Gravity of the Subject; as al$o knowing how much (coming from me) they must fall $hort of
the Merits of it, or him: but principally becau$e I court only per$ons of Judgement &amp; Candor, that can di$tingui$h
between a Native Beauty, and $purious Verni$h. This only let me premi$e, though more to excu$e my weakne$s in
the menaging, than to in$inuate my ability in accompli$hing this $o arduous a Task, that the$e profound Dialogues
have bin found $o unea$y to Tran$late, that neither affectation of Novelty could induce the French, nor the
Tran$lating humour per$wade the Germans to undertake them. This difficulty, as I conceived, was charged either
upon the Intricacy of this manner of Writing, or upon the $ingular Elegance in the $tile of</I> Galilco, <I>or el$e upon the</I>
<foot>^{*} 2 <I>mi$car-</I></foot>
<pb>
<I>mi$carriage of the unfortunate</I> Mathias Berneggeius <I>who fir$t attempted to turn them into Latine for the benefit
of the Learned World.</I></P>
<P><I>I $hall not pre$ume to Cen$ure the Cen$ure which the Church of Rome pa$t upon this Doctrine and its A$$ectors.
But, on the contrary, my Author having bin indefinite in his di$cour$e, I $hall forbear to exa$perate, and attempt
to reconcile $uch per$ons to this Hypothe$is as devout e$teem for Holy Scripture, and dutifull Re$pect to Canonical
Injunctions hath made to $tand off from this Opinion: and therefore for their $akes I have at the end of the Dia-
logues by way of $upplement added an Epi$tle of</I> Galilco <I>to Her Most Serene Highne$s</I> Chri$tina Lotharinga <I>the
Grand Dutche$$e Mother of</I> Tu$cany; <I>as al$o certain Ab$tracts of</I> John Kepler, <I>Mathematician to two Empe-
rours, and</I> Didacus &agrave; Stunica <I>a famous Divine of Salam<*>nca, with an Epi$tle of</I> Paulo Antonio Fo$carini <I>a learn-
ed Carmelite of Naples, that $hew the Authority of Sacred Scripture in determining of Philo$ophical and Natu-
ral Controver$ies: hoping that the ingenious &amp; impartial Reader will meet with full $atisfaction in the $ame.
And lea$t what I have $poken of the prohibiting of the$e Pieces by the Inqui$ition may deterre any $crupulous
per$on from reading of them, I have purpo$ely in$erted the Imprimatur by which that Office licenced them. And
for a larger account of the Book or Author, I refer you to the Relation of his Life, which $hall bring up the Reare
in the Second Tome.</I></P>
<P><I>What remains of this, is that Excellent Di$cour$e of D.</I> Benedetto Ca$telli Abbate di San Benedetto Aloy$io,
<I>concerning the Men$uration of Running waters, with other Treati$es of that Learned Prelate, &amp; of the Superin-
tendent</I> Cor$ini. <I>Some may alledge, and I doe confe$s that I promi$ed to publi$h the Life of</I> Galilco <I>in this place:
But the great mi$carriages of Letters from $ome Friends in Italy and el$e where, to whom I am a Debtor for $e-
veral Remarques, &amp; from whom I daily expect yet greater Helps concerning the Hi$tory of that famous Per$onage:
the$e di$appointments, I $ay, joyned with the undeniable Reque$t of $ome Friends, who were impatient to $ee</I> Ca$telli
<I>in Engli$h, together with a con$ideration of the di$proportionate Bulk that would otherwi$e have bin betwixt the
two Volumes, per$waded me to this exchange. This deviation from my Promi$e I hope is Venial, and for the ex-
plating of it I plead Supererrogation: having in each Tome made $o large Aditions (though to my great ex-
pen$e) that they make <*>er a third part more than I $tood by promi$e bound to Publi$h. That this is $o will appearby
comparing the Contents I here prefix with the Adverti$ment I formerly Printed. For not to mention tho$e Epitomes
of</I> Kepler <I>and</I> &agrave; Stunica, <I>the whole $econd and following Books of</I> Ca$tclli, <I>were not come to my hands at the time of
my penning that Paper; yet knowing how imperfect the Volume would be without them, they being partly a $up-
plement to the Theoremes and Problemes which the Abbot had formerly Printed, and partly experiments that
had procured him and his Doctrine a very great Reputation, knowing this I $ay, I apprehended a nece$$ity of pu-
bli$hing them with the re$t: and hope that if you think not the $ervice I have done therein worth your acknowledge-
ment, you will yet at lea$t account the encrea$e of my expence a $ufficient extenuation of the Tre$pa$s that tho$e
Additions have forced me to commit upon your Patience in point of Time.</I></P>
<P><I>As for the $econd Tome, I have only this to a$$ure the Generous Readers; 1 that I am very confident I $hall
be much more punctual in publi$hing that, than (for the rea$ons above related.) I was able to be in $etting forth
this: 2 that they $hall not be abu$ed in advancing of their moneys, (as hath bin u$ed in the like ca$e) by $elling
the remaining Copyes at an under rate; and <*> that I have a very great care that no di$e$teem may by my means a-
ri$e unto this way of publi$hing Books, for that it is of excellent u$e in u$hering Great and Co$tly Volumes into
the World.</I></P>
<P><I>To $ay nothing of the di$advantages of Tran$lations in general, this of mine doubtle$s is not without it's Er-
rours, and over$ights: but tho$e of the Printer di$counted, I hope the re$t may be allowed me upon the $core of</I> Hu-
man Imbecilitic. <I>The truth is, I have a$$umed the Liberty to note the Mi$takes in the Florid Ver$ion of</I> Bernegge-
rus <I>in the Margent, not $o much to reproach him, as to convince tho$e who told me that they accounted my pains
needle$s, having his Latine Tran$lation by them. The like they $aid of the whole two Tomes: but they thereby cau$ed
me to question their Under$tanding or Veracity. For $ome of the Books were yet never extant: As for in$tance;
the Mcchanicks of Mon$ieur</I> Des Cartes, <I>a Manu$cript which I found among$t the many other Rarities that en-
rich the well-cho$en Library of my Learned and Worthy Friend Dr.</I> Charles Scarburgh; <I>the Experiments of Gra-
vity, and the Life of</I> Galileo, <I>both my own: Others were included in Volumes of great price, or $o di$per$ed that
they were not to be purcha$ed for any money; as tho$e of</I> Kepler, &agrave; Stunica, Archimedes, Tartaglia, <I>and the Mecha-
nicks of</I> Galileo: <I>And the remainder, though ea$yer to procure, were harder to be under$tood; as</I> Tartaglia <I>his notes
on</I> Archimedes, Torricellio <I>his Doctrine of Projects,</I> Galileo <I>his Epi$tle to the Dutche$$e of</I> Tu$cany, <I>and above all
his Dialogues</I> de Motu; <I>(never till now done into any Language) which were $o intermixt of Latine and Italian,
that the difficulty of the Stile, joyned with the intricatne$$e of the Subject rendered them Unplea$ant, if not wholly
Vnintelligible, to $uch as were not ab$olute Ma$ters of both the Tongues.</I></P>
<P><I>To conclude; according to the entertainment that you plea$e to afford the$e Collections, I $hall be encouraged to
proceed with the Publication of a large Body of Hydrography; declaring the Hi$tory, Art, Lawes, and Apendages
of that Princely Study of Navigation, wherein I have omitted nothing of note that can be found either in</I> Dud-
ley, Fournier, Aurigarius, Nonius, Snellus, Mar$ennus, Bay$ius, Mori$etu<*> Blondus, Wagoner, <I>abroad, or learnt
amongst our Mariners at home, touching the Office of an Admiral, Commander, Pilot, Modelli$t, Shipwright,
Gunner, &amp;c.</I></P>
<P><I>But order requiring that I $hould di$charge my fir$t Obligation before I contract a $econd; I $hall detein you no
longer in the Portall, but put you into po$$e$$ion of the Premi$es,</I></P>

<P>Though the difference between Men and other
living Creatures be very great, yet happly he that

worth athou$and, when as a thou$and are not worth one.</I> This difference
hath dependence upon the different abilities of their Intelle-
ctuals; which I reduce to the being, or not being a Philo$o-
pher; in regard that Philo$ophy as being the proper food of
$uch as live by it, di$tingui$heth a Man from the common E$-
$ence of the Vulgar in a more or le$s honourable degree accord-
ing to the variety of that diet. In this $ence he that hath the
highe$t looks, is of highe$t quality; and the turning over of
the great Volume of Nature, which is the proper Object of
Philo$ophy is the way to make one look high: in which Book,
although what$oever we read, as being the Work of Al-
mighty God, is therefore mo$t proportionate; yet notwith-
$tanding that is more ab$olute and noble wherein we more
plainly de$erne his art and skill. The <I>Con$titution</I> of the <I>Vnivers,</I>
among all Phy$ical points that fall within Humane Compre-
hen$ion, may, in my opinion, be preferred to the Precedency:
for if that in regard of univer$al extent it excell all others, it
ought as the Rule and Standard of the re$t to goe before
them in Nobility. Now if ever any per$ons might challenge

<head>THE AUTHOR'S
INTRODUCTION.</head>
<P>Judicious Reader,</P>
<P><I>There was publi$hed $ome years $ince in</I> Rome <I>a $alutiferous Edict, that, for
the obviating of the dangerous Scandals of the pre$ent Age, impo$ed a $ea-
$onable Silence upon the Pythagorean Opinion of the Mobility of the Earth.
There want not $uch as unadvi$edly affirm, that that Decree was not the produ-
ction of a $ober Scrutiny, but of an ill informed Pa$sion; &amp; one may hear $ome mut-
ter that Con$ultors altogether ignorant of A$tronomical Ob$ervations ought not
to clipp the Wings of Speculative Wits with ra$h Prohibitions. My zeale can-
not keep $ilence when I hear the$e incon$iderate complaints. I thought fit, as being thoroughly ac-
quainted with that prudent Determination, to appear openly upon the Theatre of the World as a Wit-
ne$s of the naked Truth. I was at that time in</I> Rome; <I>and had not only the audiences, but applauds of
the mo$t Eminent Prelates of that Court; nor was that Decree Publi$hed without Previous Notice given
me thereof. Therefore it is my re$olution in the pre$ent ca$e to give Foraign Nations to $ee that this
point is as well under stood in</I> Italy, <I>and particularly in</I> Rome, <I>as Tran$alpine Diligence can imagine
it to be: and collecting together all the proper Speculations that concern the</I> Copernican Sy$teme,
<I>to let them know, that the notice of all preceded the Cen$ure of the</I> Roman Court; <I>and that there
proceed from this Climate not only Doctrines for the health of the Soul, but al$o ingenious Di$coveries
for the recreating of the Mind.</I></P>
<P><I>To this end I have per$onated the</I> Copernican <I>in this Di$cour$e; proceeding upon an Hypothe$is
purely Mathematical; $triving by all artificial wayes to repre$ent it Superiour, not to that of the Im-
mobility of the Earth ab$olutely, but according as it is mentioned by $ome, that retein no more, but the
name of</I> Peripateticks, <I>and are content, without going farther, to adore Shadows, not philo$ophizing
with requi$it caution, but with the $ole remembrance of four</I> Principles, <I>but badly under $tood.</I></P>
<P><I>We $hall treat of three principall heads. Fir$t I will endeavour to $hew that all Experiments that can
be made upon the Earth are in$ufficient means to conclude it's Mobility, but are indifferently applicable
to the Earth moveable or immoveable: and I hope that on this occa$ion we $hall di$cover many ob$er-
vable pa$$ages unknown to the Ancients. Secondly we will examine the C&oelig;le$tiall</I> Ph&oelig;nomena
<I>that make for the</I> Copernican Hypothe$is, <I>as if it were to prove ab$olutely victorious; adding by the
way certain new Ob$ervations, which yet $erve only for the A$tronomical Facility, not for Natural
Nece&szlig;ity. In the third place I will propo$e an ingenuous Fancy. I remember that I have $aid many
years $ince, that the unknown Probleme of the Tide might receive $ome light, admitting the Earths
Motion. This Po$ition of mine pa$sing from one to another had found charitable Fathers that
adopted it for the I$$ue of their own wit. Now, becau$e no $tranger may ever appear that defending him-
$elf with our armes $hall charge us with want of caution in $o principal an Accident, I have thought
good to lay down tho$e probabilities that would render it credible, admitting that the Earth did
move. I hope, that by the$e Con$ider ations the World will come to know, that if other Nations have
Navigated more than we, we have not $tudied le$s than they; &amp; that our returning to a$$ert the Earths
Stability, and to take the contrary only for a Mathematical</I> Capriccio, <I>proceeds not from inadvertency
of what others have thought thereof, but (had we no other inducements) from tho$e Rea$ons that Pic-
ty, Religion, the Knowledge of the Divine Omnipotency, and a con$ciou$ne$s of the incapacity of mans
Vnder$tanding dictate unto us.</I></P>
<foot>^{*} 3 <I>With</I></foot>
<pb>
<P><I>With all I conceived it very proper to expre$s the$e conceits by way of Dialogue, which, as not being
bound up to the riggid ob$ervance of Mathematical Laws, gives place al$o to Digre$sions that are
$ometimes no le$s curious than the principal Argument.</I></P>
<P><I>I chanced to be $everal years $ince, at $everal times, in the Stupendious Citty of</I> Venice, <I>where I
conver$ed with</I> Signore Giovan France$co Sagredo <I>of a Noble Extraction, and piercing wit. There
came thither from</I> Florence <I>at the $ame time</I> Signore Filippo Salviati, <I>who$e lea$t glory was the Emi-
nence of his Blood, and Magnificence of his E$tate: a $ublime Wit that fed not more hungerly upon
any plea$ure than on elevated Speculations. In the company of the$e two I often di$cour$ed of the$e
matters before a certain Peripatetick Philo$opher who $eemed to have no geater ob$tacle in under$tand-
ing of the Truth, than the Fame he had acquired by Ari$totelical Interpretations.</I></P>
<P><I>Now, $eeing that inexorable Death hath deprived</I> Venice <I>and</I> Florence <I>of tho$e two great Lights in
the very Meridian of their years, I did re$olve, as far as my poor ability would permit, to perpetuate
their lives to their honour in the$e leaves, bringing them in as Interlocutors in the pre$ent Controver$y.
Nor $hall the Honest Peripatetick want his place, to whom for his exce$sive affection to wards the Com-
mentaries of</I> Simplicius, <I>I thought fit, without mentioning his own Name, to leave that of the Author
he $o much re$pected. Let tho$e two great Souls, ever venerable to my heart, plea$e to accept this pu-
blick Monument of my never dying Love; and let the remembr ance of their Eloquence a$si$t me in
delivering to Po$terity the Con$ider ations that I have promi$ed.</I></P>
<P><I>There ca$ually happened (as was u$uall) $everal di$cour$es at times between the$e Gentlemen, the
which had rather inflamed than $atisfied in their wits the thir$t they had to be learning; whereupon
they took a di$creet re$olution to meet together for certain dayes, in which all other bu$ine$s $et a$ide,
they might betake them$elves more methodically to contemplate the Wonders of God in Heaven, and in
the Earth: the place appointed for their meeting being in the Palace of the Noble</I> Sagredo, <I>after the
due, but very $hort complements</I>; Signore Salviati <I>began in this manner.</I></P>

<P>It was our ye$terdayes re$olution, and a-
greement, that we $hould to day di$cour$e
the mo$t di$tinctly, and particularly we
could po$$ible, of the natural rea$ons, and
their efficacy that have been hitherto al-
ledged on the one or other part, by the
maintainers of the Po$itions, <I>Aristotelian,</I>
and <I>Ptolomaique</I>; and by the followers
<marg>Copernicus <I>repu-
teth the earth &oelig;
Globe like to a Pla-
net.</I></marg>
of the <I>Copernican Sy$teme</I>: And becau$e
<I>Copernicus</I> placing the Earth among the moveable Bodies of Hea-
ven, comes to con$titute a Globe for the $ame like to a Planet; it
would be good that we began our di$putation with the examina-
tion of what, and how great the energy of the <I>Peripateticks</I> ar-
guments is, when they demon$trate, that this <I>Hypothe$is</I> is impo$-
<foot>A fible</foot>
<p n=>2</p>
$ible: Since that it is nece$$ary to introduce in Nature, $ub$tances
<marg><I>C&oelig;le$tial $ub$tan-
ces that are inalte-
rable, and Elemen-
tary that be alte-
rable, are nece$$ary
in the opinion of</I>
Ari$totle.</marg>
different betwixt them$elves, that is, the C&oelig;le$tial, and Elementa-
ry; that impa$$ible and immortal, this alterable and corruptible.
Which argument <I>Ari$totle</I> handleth in his book <I>De C&oelig;lo,</I> in$inu-
ating it fir$t, by $ome di$cour$es dependent on certain general a$-
$umptions, and afterwards confirming it with experiments and per-
ticular demon$trations: following the $ame method, I will pro-
pound, and freely $peak my judgement, $ubmitting my $elf to
your cen$ure, and particularly to <I>Simplicius,</I> a Stout Champion
and contender for the <I>Ari$totelian</I> Doctrine.</P>
<marg>Ari$totle <I>maketh
the World perfect,
becau$e it hath the
threefold demen$i-
on.</I></marg>
<P>And the fir$t Step of the <I>Peripatetick</I> arguments is that, where <I>A-
ri$totle</I> proveth the integrity and perfection of the World, telling
us, that it is not a $imple line, nor a bare $uperficies, but a body
adorned with Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity; and becau$e
there are no more dimen$ions but the$e three; The World having
them, hath all, and having all, is to be concluded perfect. And
again, that by $imple length, that magnitude is con$tituted, which
is called a Line, to which adding breadth, there is framed the Su-
perficies, and yet further adding the altitude or profoundity, there
re$ults the Body, and after the$e three dimen$ions there is no
pa$$ing farther, $o that in the$e three the integrity, and to $o $peak,
totality is terminated, which I might but with ju$tice have requi-
red <I>Ari$totle</I> to have proved to me by nece$$ary con$equences, the
rather in regard he was able to do it very plainly, and $peedily.</P>
<P>SIMPL. What $ay you to the excellent demon$trations in the
<marg>Ari$totles <I>demon-
$trations to prove
the dimen$ions to be
three and no more.</I></marg>
2. 3. and 4. Texts, after the definition of <I>Continual</I>? have you it
not fir$t there proved, that there is no more but three dimen$ions,
for that tho$e three are all things, and that they are every where?
And is not this confirmed by the Doctrine and Authority of the
<marg><I>The number three
celebrated among $t
the</I> Pythagorians</marg>
<I>Pythagorians,</I> who $ay that all things are determined by three, be-
ginning, middle, and end, which is the number of All? And where
leave you that rea$on, namely, that as it were by the law of Na-
ture, this number is u$ed in the $acrifices of the Gods? And why
being $o dictated by nature, do we atribute to tho$e things that
are three, and not to le$$e, the title of all? why of two is it $aid
both, and not all, unle$s they be three? And all this Doctrine you
have in the $econd Text. Afterwards in the third, <I>Ad pleniorem</I>
<marg>Omne, Totum &amp;
Perfectum.</marg>
<I>$cientiam,</I> we read that <I>All,</I> the <I>Whole,</I> and <I>Perfect,</I> are formally
one and the $ame; and that therefore onely the <I>Body,</I> among$t
magnitudes is perfect: becau$e it is determined by three, which is
All, and being divi$ible three manner of waies, it is every way di-
vi$ible; but of the others, $ome are dividible in one manner, and
$ome in two, becau$e according to the number a$$ixed, they have
their divi$ion and continuity, and thus one magnitude is continu-
<marg>Or Solid.</marg>
ate one way, another two, a third, namely the Body, every way.
<foot>More-</foot>
<p n=>3</p>
Moreover in the fourth Text; doth he not after $ome other Do-
ctrines, prove it by another demon$tration? <I>Scilicet,</I> That no tran-
$ition is made but according to $ome defect (and $o there is a tran-
$ition or pa$$ing from the line to the $uperficies, becau$e the line is
defective in breadth) and that it is impo$$ible for the perfect to
want any thing, it being every way $o; therefore there is no tran-
$ition from the Solid or Body to any other magnitude. Now
think you not that by all the$e places he hath $ufficiently proved,
how that there's no going beyond the three dimen$ions, Length,
Breadth, and Thickne$s, and that therefore the body or $olid,
which hath them all, is perfect?</P>
<P>SALV. To tell you true, I think not my $elf bound by all the$e
rea$ons to grant any more but onely this, That that which hath
beginning, middle, and end, may, and ought to be called perfect: But
that then, becau$e beginning, middle, and end, are Three, the num-
ber Three is a perfect number, and hath a faculty of conferring
<I>Perfection</I> on tho$e things that have the $ame, I find no inducement
to grant; neither do I under$tand, nor believe that, for example,
of feet, the number three is more perfect then four or two, nor do
I conceive the number four to be any imperfection to the Ele-
ments: and that they would be more perfect if they were three.
Better therefore it had been to have left the$e $ubtleties to the
<I>Rhetoricians,</I> and to have proved his intent, by nece$$ary demon$tra-
tion; for $o it behoves to do in demon$trative $ciences.</P>
<P>SIMPL. You $eem to $corn the$e rea$ons, and yet it is all the
Doctrine of the <I>Pythagorians,</I> who attribute $o much to numbers;
and you that be a <I>Mathematician,</I> and believe many opinions in
the <I>Pythagorick</I> Philo$ophy, $eem now to contemn their My-
$teries.</P>
<P>SALV. That the <I>Pythagorians</I> had the $cience of numbers in
high e$teem, and that <I>Plato</I> him$elf admired humane under$tand-
ing, and thought that it pertook of Divinity, for that it under-
<marg>Plato <I>held that
humane under-
$tanding partook
ofaivi<*>ity, becau$e
it understood num-
bers.</I></marg>
$tood the nature of numbers, I know very well, nor $hould I be
far from being of the $ame opinion: But that the My$teries for
which <I>Pythagoras</I> and his $ect, had the Science of numbers in $uch
veneration, are the follies that abound in the mouths and writings
<marg><I>The My$tery of</I>
Pythagorick <I>num-
bers fabulous.</I></marg>
of the vulgar, I no waies credit: but rather becau$e I know that they,
to the end admirable things might not be expo$ed to the con-
tempt, and $corne of the vulgar, cen$ured as $acrilegious, the pub-
<marg>De Papyrio p &aelig;-
textato, <I>Gellius</I> <*>
2. 3.</marg>
li$hing of the ab$truce properties of Numbers, and incommen-
$urable and irrational quantities, by them inve$tigated; and di-
vulged, that he who di$covered them, was tormented in the other
World: I believe that $ome one of them to deter the common
$ort, and free him$elf from their inqui$itivene$s, told them that the
my$teries of numbers were tho$e trifles, which afterwards did $o
<foot>A 2 $pread</foot>
<p n=>4</p>
$pread among$t the vulgar; and this with a di$cretion and $ubtlety
re$embling that of the prudent young man, that to be freed
from the importunity of his inqui$itive Mother or Wife, I know
not whether, who pre$$ed him to impart the $ecrets of the Senate,
contrived that $tory, which afterwards brought her and many o-
ther women to be derided and laught at by the $ame Senate.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will not be of the number of tho$e who are over curi-
ous about the <I>Pythagorick</I> my$teries; but adhering to the point
in hand; I reply, that the rea$ons produced by <I>Ari$totle</I> to prove
the dimen$ions to be no more than three, $eem to me conclu-
dent, and I believe, That had there been any more evident demon-
$trations thereof, <I>Ari$totle</I> would not have omitted them.</P>
<P>SAGR. Put in at lea$t, if he had known, or remembred any more.
But you <I>Salviatus</I> would do me a great plea$ure to alledge unto
me $ome arguments that may be evident, and clear enough for me
to comprehend.</P>
<P>SALV. I will; and they $hall be $uch as are not onely to be ap-
prehended by you, but even by <I>Simplicius</I> him$elf: nor onely
to be comprehended, but are al$o already known, although hap-
ly unob$erved; and for the more ea$ie under$tanding thereof,
we will take this Pen and Ink, which I $ee already prepared for
<marg><I>A Geometrical de-
mon$tration of the
triple dimen$ion.</I></marg>
$uch occa$ions, and de$cribe a few figures. And fir$t we will note
[Fig. 1. <I>at the end of this Dialog.</I>] the$e two points AB, and draw
from the one to the other the curved lines, ACB, and ADB, and the
right line A B, I demand of you which of them, in your mind, is
that which determines the di$tance between the terms AB, &amp; why?</P>
<P><I>S</I>AGR. I $hould $ay the right line, and not the crooked, as well
becau$e the right is $horter, as becau$e it is one, $ole, and deter-
minate, whereas the others are infinit, unequal, and longer; and my
determination is grounded upon that, That it is one, and certain.</P>
<P>SALV. We have then the right line to determine the length be-
tween the two terms; let us add another right line and parallel to
AB, which let be CD, [<I>Fig.</I> 2.] $o that there is put between them a
$uperficies, of which I de$ire you to a$$ign me the breadth, therefore
departing from the point A, tell me how, and which way you will
go, to end in the line C D, and $o to point me out the breadth com-
prehended between tho$e lines; let me know whether you will
terminate it according to the quantity of the curved line A E, or
the right line A F, or any other.</P>
<P>SIMPL. According to the right A F, and not according to the
crooked, that being already excluded from $uch an u$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. But I would take neither of them, $eeing the right line
A F runs obliquely; But would draw a line, perpendicular to C
D, for this $hould $eem to me the $horte$t, and the propere$t of
infinite that are greater, and unequal to one another, which may be
<foot>pro-</foot>
<p n=>5</p>
produced from the term A to any other part of the oppo$ite line
C D.</P>
<P>SALV. Your choice, and the rea$on you bring for it in my judg-
ment is mo$t excellent; $o that by this time we have proved that
the fir$t dimen$ion is determined by a right line, the $econd name-
ly the breadth with another line right al$o, and not onely right,
but withall, at right-angles to the other that determineth the
length, and thus we have the two dimen$ions of length and
breadth, definite and certain. But were you to bound or termi-
nate a height, as for example, how high this Roof is from the pave-
ment, that we tread on, being that from any point in the Roof,
we may draw infinite lines, both curved, and right, and all of di-
ver$e lengths to infinite points of the pavement, which of all the$e
lines would you make u$e of?</P>
<P>SAGR. I would fa$ten a line to the Seeling, and with a plummet
that $hould hang at it, would let it freely di$tend it $elf till it
$hould reach well near to the pavement, and the length of $uch a
thread being the $treighte$t and $horte$t of all the lines, that could
po$sibly be drawn from the $ame point to the pavement, I would
$ay was the true height of this Room.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well, And when from the point noted in the pave-
ment by this pendent thread (taking the pavement to be levell
and not declining) you $hould produce two other right lines, one
for the length, and the other for the breadth of the $uperficies of
the$aid pavement, what angles $hould they make with the $aid
thread?</P>
<P>SAGR. They would doubtle$s meet at right angles, the $aid
lines falling perpendicular, and the pavement being very plain and
levell.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore if you a$$ign any point, for the term from whence
to begin your mea$ure; and from thence do draw a right line, as
the terminator of the fir$t mea$ure, namely of the length, it will
follow of nece$$ity, that that which is to de$ign out the largene$s
or breadth, toucheth the fir$t at right-angles, and that that which is
to denote the altitude, which is the third dimen$ion, going from the
$ame point formeth al$o with the other two, not oblique but right
angles, and thus by the three perpendiculars, as by three lines, one,
certain, and as $hort as is po$$ible, you have the three dimen$ions
A B length, A C breadth, and A D height; and becau$e, clear it
is, that there cannot concurre any more lines in the $aid point, $o
as to make therewith right-angles, and the dimen$ions ought to
be determined by the $ole right lines, which make between them-
$elves right-angles; therefore the dimen$ions are no more but
three, and that which hath three hath all, and that which hath all,
is divi$ible on all $ides, and that which is $o, is perfect, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>

may not I protract another line underneath, unto the point A,
that may be perpendicular to the re$t?</P>
<P>SALV. You can doubtle$s, at one and the $ame point, make no
more than three right lines concurre, that con$titute right angles
between them$elves.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $ee what <I>Simplicius</I> means, namely, that $hould the
$aid D A be prolonged downward, then by that means there might
be drawn two others, but they would be the $ame with the fir$t
three, differing onely in this, that whereas now they onely touch,
then they would inter$ect, but not produce new dimen$ions.</P>

<P>SIMPL. I will not $ay that this your argument may not be con-
cludent; but yet this I $ay with <I>Ari$totle,</I> that in things natural
it is not alwaies nece$$ary, to bring <I>Mathematical</I> demon$trations.</P>
<P>SAGR. Grant that it were $o where $uch proofs cannot be had,
yet if this ca$e admit of them, why do not you u$e them? But it
would be good we $pent no more words on this particular, for I
think that <I>Salviatus</I> will yield, both to <I>Ari$totle,</I> and you, with-
out farther demon$tration, that the World is a body, and perfect,
yea mo$t perfect, as being the greate$t work of God.</P>
<P>SALV. So really it is, therefore leaving the general contempla-

to</I> Ari$totle, <I>C&oelig;le-
$tial and Elemen-

tion of the whole, let us de$cend to the con$ideration of its parts,
which <I>Ari$totle,</I> in his fir$t divi$ion, makes two, and they very diffe-
rent and almo$t contrary to one another; namely the C&oelig;le$tial,
and Elementary: that ingenerable, incorruptible, unalterable, un-
pa$$ible, &amp;c. and this expo$ed to a continual alteration, mutati-
on, &amp;c. Which difference, as from its original principle, he de-
rives from the diver$ity of local motions, and in this method he
proceeds.</P>
<P>Leaving the $en$ible, if I may $o $peak, and retiring into the
Ideal world, he begins Architectonically to con$ider that nature
being the principle of motion, it followeth that natural bodies be
<marg><I>Local motion of
three kinds, right,
circular, &amp; mixt.</I></marg>
indued with local motion. Next he declares local motion to be
of three kinds, namely, circular, right, and mixt of right and cir-
cular: and the two fir$t he calleth $imple, for that of all lines the
<marg><I>Circular, and
$treight motions
are $imple, as pro-
ceeding by $imple
lines.</I></marg>
circular, and right are onely $imple; and here $omewhat re-
$training him$elf, he defineth anew, of $imple motions, one to be
circular, namely that which is made about the <I>medium,</I> and the
other namely the right, upwards, and downwards; upwards, that
which moveth from the <I>medium</I>; downwards, that which goeth to-
wards the <I>medium.</I> And from hence he infers, as he may by and ne-
<marg><I>Ad medium, &agrave; me-
dio, &amp; circa medi-
um.</I></marg>
ce$$ary con$equence, that all $imple motions are confined to the$e
three kinds, namely, to the <I>medium,</I> from the <I>medium,</I> and about
the <I>medium</I>; the which corre$ponds $aith he, with what hath been
$aid before of a body, that it al$o is perfected by three things, and $o
<foot>is</foot>
<p n=>7</p>
is its motion. Having confirmed the$e motions, he proceeds $aying,
that of natural bodies $ome being $imple, and $ome compo$ed of
them (and he calleth $imple bodies tho$e, that have a principle
of motion from nature, as the Fire and Earth) it follows that
$imple motions belong to $imple bodies, and mixt to the com-
pound; yet in $uch $ort, that the compounded incline to the part
predominant in the compo$ition.</P>
<P>SAGR. Pray you hold a little <I>Salviatus,</I> for I find $o many
doubts to $pring up on all $ides in this di$cour$e, that I $hall be
con$trained, either to communicate them if I would attentively
hearken to what you $hall add, or to take off my attention from
the things $poken, if I would remember objections.</P>
<P>SALV. I will very willingly $tay, for that I al$o run the $ame
hazard, and am ready at every $tep to lo$e my $elf whil$t I $ail be-
tween Rocks, and boi$terous Waves, that make me, as they $ay, to
lo$e my <I>Compa$s</I>; therefore before I make them more, propound
your difficulties.</P>
<marg><I>The definition of
Nature, either im-
perfect, or un$ea$o-
nable, produced by</I>
Ari$totle.</marg>
<P>SAGR. You and <I>Ari$totle</I> together would at fir$t take me a
little out of the $en$ible World, to tell me of the <I>Architecture,</I>
wherewith it ought to be fabricated; and very appo$itly begin to
tell me, that a natural body is by nature moveable, nature being
(as el$ewhere it is defined) the principle of motion. But here I
am $omewhat doubtfull why <I>Ari$totle</I> $aid not that of natural bo-
dies, $ome are moveable by nature, and others immoveable, for
that in the definition, nature is $aid to be the principle of Motion,
and Re$t; for if natural bodies have all a principle of motion,
either he might have omitted the mention of Re$t, in the definiti-
on of nature: or not have introduced $uch a definition in this place.
Next, as to the declaration of what <I>Ari$totle</I> intends by $imple
motions, and how by Spaces he determines them, calling tho$e $im-
ple, that are made by $imple lines, which are onely the right, and
<marg><I>The Helix about
the Cylinder may
be $aid to be a $im-
ple line.</I></marg>
circular, I entertain it willingly; nor do I de$ire to tenter the
in$tance of the Helix, about the Cylinder; which in that it is in e-
very part like to it $elf, might $eemingly be numbred among $im-
ple lines. But herein I cannot concurre, that he $hould $o re-
$train $imple motions (whil$t he $eems to go about to repeat the
$ame definition in other words) as to call one of them the motion
about the <I>medium,</I> the others <I>Sur$um &amp; Deor$um,</I> namely up-
wards and downward; which terms are not to be u$ed, out of the
World fabricated, but imply it not onely made, but already in-
habited by us; for if the right motion be $imple, by the $implicity
of the right line, and if the $imple motion be natural, it is made on
every $ide, to wit, upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards, to
the right, to the left, and if any other way can be imagined, pro-
vided it be $traight, it $hall agree to any $imple natural body; or
<foot>if</foot>
<p n=>8</p>
if not $o, then the $uppo$ion of <I>Ari$totle</I> is defective. It appears
<marg>Ari$totle <I>accom-
modates the rules of</I>
Architecture <I>to
the frame of the
World, and not the
frame to the rules.</I></marg>
moreover that <I>Ari$totle</I> hinteth but one circular motion alone to
be in the World, and con$equently but one onely Center, to
which alone the motions of upwards and downwards, refer. All
which are apparent proofs, that <I>Ari$totles</I> aim is, to make white
black, and to accommodate <I>Architectur<*></I> to the building, and not
to modle the building according to the precepts of <I>Arthitecture:</I>
for if I $hould $ay that Nature in Univer$al may have a thou-
$and Circular Motions, and by con$equence a thou$and Cen-
ters, there would be al$o a thou$and motions upwards, and
downwards. Again he makes as hath been $aid, a $imple motion,
and a mixt motion, calling $imple, the circular and right; and
mixt, the compound of them two: of natural bodies he calls $ome
$imple (namely tho$e that have a natural principle to $imple mo-
tion) and others compound: and $imple motions he attributes
to $imple bodies, and the compounded to the compound; but by
compound motion he doth no longer under$tand the mixt of right
and circular, which may be in the World; but introduceth a mixt
motion as impo$$ible, as it is impo$$ible to mixe oppo$ite motions
made in the $ame right line, $o as to produce from them a motion
partly upwards, partly downwards; and, to moderate $uch an ab-
$urdity, and impo$$ibility, he a$$erts that $uch mixt bodies move
<marg><I>Right motion, $ome-
times $imple, ard
$ometimes mixt ac-
cording to</I> Ari$t.</marg>
according to the $imple part predominant: which nece$$itates
others to $ay, that even the motion made by the $ame right line is
$ometimes $imple, and $ometimes al$o compound: $o that the $im-
plicity of the motion, is no longer dependent onely on the $im-
plicity of the line.</P>
<P>SIMPL. How? Is it not difference $ufficient, that the $imple and
ab$olute are more $wift than that which proceeds from predomi-
nion? and how much fa$ter doth a piece of pure Earth de$cend,
than a piece of Wood?</P>
<P>SAGR. Well, <I>Simplicius</I>; But put ca$e the $implicity for this
cau$e was changed, be$ides that there would be a hundred thou-
$and mixt motions, you would not be able to determine the $im-
ple; nay farther, if the greater or le$$e velocity be able to alter
the $implicity of the motion, no $imple body $hould move with a
$imple motion; $ince that in all natural right motions, the veloci-
ty is ever encrea$ing, and by con$equence $till changing the $impli-
city, which as it is $implicity, ought of con$equence to be immu-
table, and that which more importeth, you charge <I>Ari$totle</I> with
another thing, that in the definition of motions compounded, he
hath not made mention of tardity nor velocity, which you now
in$ert for a nece$$ary and e$$ential point. Again you can draw
no advantage from this rule, for that there will be among$t the
mixt bodies $ome, (and that not a few) that will move $wiftly,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>9</p>
and others more $lowly than the $imple; as for example, Lead, and
Wood, in compari$on of earth; and therefore among$t the$e mo-
tions, which call you the $imple, and which the mixt?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I would call that $imple motion, which is made by a
$imple body, and mixt, that of a compound body.</P>
<P>SAGR. Very well, and yet <I>Simplicius</I> a little before you $aid,
that the $imple, and compound motions, di$covered which were
mixt, and which were $imple bodies; now you will have me by
$imple and mixt bodies, come to know which is the $imple, and
which is the compound motion: an excellent way to keep us igno-
rant, both of motions and bodies. Moreover you have al$o a little
above declared, how that a greater velocity did not $uffice, but
you $eek a third condition for the definement of $imple motion, for
which <I>Ari$totle</I> contented him$elf with one alone, namely, of the
$implicity of the Space, or <I>Medium</I>: But now according to you,
the $imple motion, $hall be that which is made upon a $imple line,
with a certain determinate velocity, by a body $imply moveable.
Now be it as you plea$e, and let us return to <I>Ari$totle,</I> who defi-
neth the mixt motion to be that compounded of the right, and cir-
cular, but produceth not any body, which naturally moveth with
$uch a motion.</P>
<P>SALV. I come again to <I>Ari$totle,</I> who having very well, and
Methodically begun his di$cour$e, but having a greater aim to
re$t at, and hit a marke, predefigned in his minde, then that to
which his method lead him, digre$$ing from the purpo$e, he comes
to a$$ert, as a thing known and manife$t, that as to the motions
directly upwards or downwards, they naturally agree to Fire, and
Earth; and that therefore it is nece$$ary, that be$ides the$e bodies,
which are neer unto us, there mu$t be in nature another, to which
the circular motion may agree: which $hall be $o much the more
excellent by how much the circular motion is more perfect, then the
$treight, but how much more perfect that is than this, he deter-
mines from the greatne$s of the circular lines perfection above the
<marg><I>The circular line
perfect, according
to</I> Ari$totle, <I>and
but the right im-
perfect, and why.</I></marg>
right line; calling that perfect, and this imperfect; imperfect, be-
cau$e if infinite it wanteth a termination, and end: and if it be fi-
nite, there is yet $omething beyond which it may be prolonged.
This is the ba$is, ground work, and ma$ter-$tone of all the Fabrick
of the <I>Aristotelian</I> World, upon which they $uper$truct all their
other properties, of neither heavy nor light, of ingenerable incor-
ruptible, exemption from all motions, $ome onely the local, &amp;c.
And all the$e pa$$ions he affirmeth to be proper to a $imple body
that is moved circularly; and the contrary qualities of gravity,
levity, corruptibility, &amp;c. he a$$igns to bodies naturally moveable
in a $treight line, for that if we have already di$covered defects in
the foundation, we may rationally que$tion what $oever may far-
<foot>B ther</foot>
<p n=>10</p>
ther built thereon. I deny not, that this which <I>Ari$totle</I> hitherto
hath introduced, with a general di$cour$e dependent upon univer-
$al primary principles, hathbeen $ince in proce$s of time, re-inforced
with particular rea$ons, and experiments; all which it would be
nece$$ary di$tinctly to con$ider and weigh; but becau$e what hath
been $aid hitherto pre$ents to $uch as con$ider the $ame many and
no $mall difficulties, (and yet it would be nece$$ary, that the pri-
mary principles and fundamentals, were certain, firm, and e$tabli$h-
ed, that $o they might with more confidence be built upon) it
would not be ami$s, before we farther multiply doubts, to $ee if
haply (as I conjecture) betaking our $elves to other waies, we may
not light upon a more direct and $ecure method; and with better
con$idered principles of Architecture lay our primary fundamen-
tals. Therefore $u$pending for the pre$ent the method of <I>Ari$to-
tle,</I> (which we will re-a$$ume again in its proper place, and parti-
cularly examine;) I $ay, that in the things hitherto affirmed by
<marg><I>The world is $up-
po$ed by the Au-
thor to be perfectly
ordinate.</I></marg>
him, I agree with him, and admit that the World is a body enjoy-
ing all dimen$ions, and therefore mo$t perfect; and I add, that as
$uch, it is nece$$arily mo$t ordinate, that is, having parts between
them$elves, with exqui$ite and mo$t perfect order di$po$ed; which
a$$umption I think is not to be denied, neither by you or any
other.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Who can deny it? the fir$t particular (of the worlds
dimen$ions) is taken from <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf, and its denominati-
on of ordinate $eems onely to be a$$umed from the order which it
mo$t exactly keeps.</P>
<marg><I>Streight motion
impo$$ible in the
world exactly or-
dinate.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. This principle then e$tabli$hed, one may immediately
conclude, that if the entire parts of the World $hould be by their
nature moveable, it is impo$$ible that their motions $hould be
right, or other than circular; and the rea$on is $ufficiently ea$ie,
and manife$t; for that what$oever moveth with a right motion,
changeth place; and continuing to move, doth by degrees more
and more remove from the term from whence it departed, and
from all the places thorow which it $ucce$$ively pa$$ed; and if
$uch motion naturally $uited with it, then it was not at the be-
ginning in its proper place; and $o the parts of the World were
not di$po$ed with perfect order. But we $uppo$e them to be per-
fectly ordinate, therefore as $uch, it is impo$$ible that they $hould
by nature change place, and con$equently move in a right moti-
<marg><I>Right motion by

on. Again, the right motion being by nature infinite, for that
the right line is infinite and indeterminate, it is impo$$ible that
<marg><I>Motion by a right
line naturally im-
po$$ible.</I></marg>
any moveable can have a natural principle of moving in a right
line; namely toward the place whither it is impo$$ible to arrive,
<marg><I>Nature attempts
not things impo$$i-
ble to be effected.</I></marg>
there being no pr&aelig;-$inite term; and nature, as <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
$aith well, never attempts to do that which can never be done,
<foot>nor</foot>
<p n=>11</p>
nor e$$aies to move whither it is impo$$ible to arrive. And if any
one $hould yet object, that albeit the right line, and con$equent-
ly the motion by it is producible <I>in infinitum,</I> that is to $ay, is in-
terminate; yet neverthele$s Nature, as one may $ay, arbitrarily
hath a$$igned them $ome terms, and given natural in$tincts to
its natural bodies to move unto the $ame; I will reply, that this
<marg><I>Right motion might
perhaps be in the
fir$t Chaos.</I></marg>
might perhaps be fabled to have come to pa$s in the fir$t Chaos,
where indi$tinct matters confu$edly and inordinately wandered;
to regulate which, Nature very appo$itely made u$e of right mo-
<marg><I>Right motion is

tions, by which, like as the well-con$tituted, moving, di$dorder
them$elves, $o were they which were before depravedly di$po$ed
by this motion ranged in order: but after their exqui$ite di$tribu-
tion and collocation, it is impo$$ible that there $hould remain na-
tural inclinations in them of longer moving in a right motion,
from which now would en$ue their removal from their proper and
natural place, that is to $ay, their di$ordination; we may there-
fore $ay that the right motion $erves to conduct the matter to erect
the work; but once erected, that it is to re$t immoveable, or if
<marg><I>Mundane bodies
moved in the be-
ginning in a right
line, and after-
wards circularly?
according to</I> Plato.</marg>
moveable, to move it $elf onely circularly. Unle$s we will $ay
with <I>Plato,</I> that the$e mundane bodies, after they had been made
and fini$hed, were for a certain time moved by their Maker, in a
right motion, but that after their attainment to certain and de-
terminate places, they were revolved one by one in Spheres, pa$-
$ing from the right to the circular motion, wherein they have
been ever $ince kept and maintained. A $ublime conceipt, and
<marg>* Thus doth he co-
vertly and mode$t-
ly $tile him$elfe

work.</marg>
worthy indeed of <I>Plato</I>: upon which, I remember to have heard
our common friend the ^{*}<I>Lyncean Academick</I> di$cour$e in this man-
ner, if I have not forgot it. Every body for any rea$on con$titu-
ted in a $tate of re$t, but which is by nature moveable, being $et
<marg><I>A moveable be-
ing in a $tate of
re$t, $hall not move
unle$s it have an

at liberty doth move; provided withal, that it have an inclina-
tion to $ome particular place; for $hould it $tand indifferently af-
fected to all, it would remain in its re$t, not having greater in-
ducement to move one way than another. From the having of
this inclination nece$$arily proceeds, that it in its moving $hall con-
<marg><I>The moveable ac-
celerates its moti-
on, going towards
the place whither
it hath an inclina-
tion.</I></marg>
tinually increa$e its acceleration, and beginning with a mo$t $low
motion, it $hall not acquire any degree of velocity, before it
$hall have pa$$ed thorow all the degrees of le$s velocity, or grea-
ter tardity: for pa$$ing from the $tate of quiet (which is the in-
<marg><I>The moveable pa$-
$ing from re$t, go-
eth thorow all the
degrees of tardity.</I></marg>
finite degree of tardity of motion) there is no rea$on by which
it $hould enter into $uch a determinate degree of velocity, before
it $hall have entred into a le$s, and into yet a le$s, before it entred
into that: but rather it $tands with rea$on, to pa$s fir$t by tho$e
degrees neare$t to that from which it departed, and from tho$e to
the more remote; but the degree from whence the moveable
<marg><I>Re$t the in$inioe
degree of tardity.</I></marg>
began to move, is that of extreme tardity, namely of re$t.
<foot>B 2 Now</foot>
<p n=>12</p>
<marg><I>The moveable doth
not accelerate, $ave
only as it approach-

Now this acceleration of motion is never made, but when the
moveable in moving acquireth it; nor is its acqui$t other than an
approaching to the place de$ired, to wit, whither its natural in-
clination attracts it, and thither it tendeth by the $horte$t way;
namely, by a right line. We may upon good grounds therefore
$ay, That Nature, to confer upon a moveable fir$t con$tituted in
re$t a determinate velocity, u$eth to make it move according to
<marg><I>Nature, to intro-
duce in the move-
able a certain de-
gree of velocity,
made it move in a
right line.</I></marg>
a certain time and $pace with a right motion. This pre$uppo$ed,
let us imagine God to have created the Orb <I>v. g.</I> of <I>Jupiter,</I> on
which he had determined to confer $uch a certain velocity, which
it ought afterwards to retain perpetually uniform; we may with
<I>Plato</I> $ay, that he gave it at the beginning a right and accelerate
motion, and that it afterwards being arrived to that intended de-
<marg><I>Vniform velocity
convenient to the
circular motion.</I></marg>
gree of velocity, he converted its right, into a circular motion,
the velocity of which came afterwards naturally to be uniform.</P>
<P>SAGR. I hearken to this Di$cour$e with great delight; and I
believe the content I take therein will be greater, when you have
$atisfied me in a doubt: that is, (which I do not very well com-
prehend) how it of nece$$ity en$ues, that a moveable departing
<marg><I>Betwixt re$t, and
any a$$igned degree
of velocity, infinite
degrees of le$s ve-
locity interpo$e.</I></marg>
from its re$t, and entring into a motion to which it had a natural
inclination, it pa$$eth thorow all the precedent degrees o$ tardity,
comprehended between any a$$igned degree of velocity, and the
$tate of re$t, which degrees are infinite? $o that Nature was not
able to confer them upon the body of <I>Jupiter,</I> his circular moti-
on being in$tantly created with $uch and $uch velocity.</P>
<marg><I>Nature doth not
immediately con-
fer a determinate
degree of velocity,
howbeit $he could.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. I neither did, nor dare $ay, that it was impo$$ible for
God or Nature to confer that velocity which you $peak of, imme-
diately; but this I $ay, that <I>de facto</I> $he did not doit; $o that the
doing it would be a work extra-natural, and by confequence mi-
raculous.</P>
<P>SAGR. Then you believe, that a $tone leaving its re$t, and en-
tring into its natural motion towards the centre of the Earth, pa$-
$eth thorow all the degrees of tardity inferiour to any degree of
velocity?</P>
<P>SALV. I do believe it, nay am certain of it; and $o certain,
that I am able to make you al$o very well $atisfied with the truth
thereof.</P>
<P>SAGR. Though by all this daies di$cour$e I $hould gain no
more but $uch a knowledge, I $hould think my time very well
be$towed.</P>
<P>SALV. By what I collect from our di$cour$e, a great part of
your $cruple lieth in that it $hould in a time, and that very $hort,
pa$s thorow tho$e infinite degrees of tardity precedent to any ve-
locity, acquired by the moveable in that time: and therefore be-
fore we go any farther, I will $eek to remove this difficulty, which
<foot>$hall</foot>
<p n=>13</p>
$hall be an ea$ie task; for I reply, that the moveable pa$$eth by
the afore$aid degrees, but the pa$$age is made without $taying in
<marg><I>The moveable de-

any of them; $o that the pa$$age requiring but one $ole in$tant
of time, and every $mall time containing infinite in$tants, we $hall
not want enough of them to a$$ign its own to each of the infinite
degrees of tardity; although the time were never $o $hort.</P>
<P>SAGR. Hitherto I apprehend you; neverthele$s it is very much

<P>SALV. You may $ay, nor yet in a year, nor in ten, no nor in a
thou$and; as I will endeavour to $hew you, and al$o happily with-
out your contradiction, to $ome $ufficiently $imple que$tions that
I will propound to you. Therefore tell me if you make any que-
$tion of granting that, that that ball in de$cending goeth increa-
$ing its <I>impetus</I> and velocity.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am mo$t certain it doth.</P>
<P>SALV. And if I $hould $ay that the <I>impetus</I> acquired in any
place of its motion, is $o much, that it would $uffice to re-carry
it to that place from which it came, would you grant it?</P>
<P>SAGR. I $hould con$ent to it without contradiction, provided al-
waies, that it might imploy without impediment its whole <I>impetus</I>
in that $ole work of re-conducting it $elf, or another equal toit, to
<marg><I>The ponderous mo-

that $elf-$ame height as it would do, in ca$e the Earth were bored
thorow the centre, and the Bullet fell a thou$and yards from the
$aid centre, for I verily believe it would pa$s beyond the centre,
a$cending as much as it had de$cended; and this I $ee plainly in
the experiment of a plummet hanging at a line, which removed
from the perpendicular, which is its $tate of re$t, and afterwards
let go, falleth towards the $aid perpendicular, and goes as far be-
yond it; or onely $o much le$s, as the oppo$ition of the air, and
line, or other accidents have hindred it. The like I $ee in the wa-
ter, which de$cending thorow a pipe, re-mounts as much as it had
de$cended.</P>
<P>SALV. You argue very well. And for that I know you will not
$cruple to grant that the acqui$t of the <I>impetus</I> is by means of the
receding from the term whence the moveable departed, and its ap-
proach to the centre, whither its motion tendeth; will you $tick
to yeeld, that two equal moveables, though de$cending by divers
lines, without any impediment, acquire equal <I>impetus,</I> provided
that the approaches to the centre be equal?</P>
<foot>SAGR</foot>
<p n=>14</p>
<P>SAGR. I do not very well under$tand the que$tion.</P>
<P>SALV. I will expre$s it better by drawing a Figure: therefore
I will $uppo$e the line A B [in <I>Fig.</I> 3.] parallel to the Horizon,
and upon the point B, I will erect a perpendicular B C; and after
that I adde this $launt line C A. Under$tanding now the line C
A to be an inclining plain exqui$itely poli$hed, and hard, upon
which de$cendeth a ball perfectly round and of very hard matter,
and $uch another I $uppo$e freely to de$cend by the perpendicular
C B: will you now confe$s that the <I>impetus</I> of that which de-
$cends by the plain C A, being arrived to the point A, may be
equal to the <I>impetus</I> acquired by the other in the point B, after
the de$cent by the perpendicular C B?</P>
<marg><I>The impetuo$ity of
moveables equally
approaching to the

<P>SAGR. I re$olutely believe $o: for in effect they have both the
$ame proximity to the centre, and by that, which I have already
granted, their impetuo$ities would be equally $ufficient to re-carry
them to the $ame height.</P>
<P>SALV. Tell me now what you believe the $ame ball would do
put upon the Horizontal plane A B?</P>
<marg><I>Vpon an horizon-
tall plane the move-
able lieth $till.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. It would lie $till, the $aid plane having no declination.</P>
<P>SALV. But on the inclining plane C A it would de$cend, but
with a gentler motion than by the perpendicular C B?</P>
<P>SAGR. I may confidently an$wer in the affirmative, it $eem-
ing to me nece$$ary that the motion by the perpendicular C B
$hould be more $wift, than by the inclining plane C A; yet ne-
verthele$s, i$ this be, how can the Cadent by the inclination ar-
rived to the point A, have as much <I>impetus,</I> that is, the $ame de-
gree of velocity, that the Cadent by the perpendicular $hall have
in the point B? the$e two Propo$itions $eem contradictory.</P>
<marg><I>The veloeity by the

nation.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. Then you would think it much more fal$e, $hould I
$ay, that the velocity of the Cadents by the perpendicular, and
inclination, are ab$olutely equal: and yet this is a Propo$ition
mo$t true, as is al$o this that the Cadent moveth more $wiftly by
the perpendicular, than by the inclination.</P>
<P>SAGR. The$e Propo$itions to my ears $ound very har$h: and
I believe to yours <I>Simplicius</I>?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have the $ame $en$e of them.</P>
<P>SALV. I conceit you je$t with me, pretending not to compre-
hend what you know better than my $elf: therefore tell me <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> when you imagine a moveable more $wift than ano-
ther, what conceit do you fancy in your mind?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I fancie one to pa$s in the $ame time a greater $pace
than the other, or to move equal $paces, but in le$$er time.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well: and for moveables equally $wift, what's
your conceit of them?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I fancie that they pa$s equal $paces in equal times.</P>
<foot>SALV-</foot>
<p n=>15</p>
<P>SALV. And have you no other conceit thereof than this?</P>
<P>SIMPL. This I think to be the proper definition of equal mo-
tions.</P>
<marg><I>Velocities are $aid
to be equal, when
the $paces pa$$ed
are proportionate to
their time.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. We will add moreover this other: and call that equal
velocity, when the $paces pa$$ed have the $ame proportion, as the
times wherein they are pa$t, and it is a more univer$al definition.</P>
<P>SALV. It is $o: for it comprehendeth the equal $paces pa$t in
equal times, and al$o the unequal pa$t in times unequal, but pro-
portionate to tho$e $paces. Take now the $ame Figure, and apply-
ing the conceipt that you had of the more ha$tie motion, tell me
why you think the velocity of the Cadent by C B, is greater
than the velocity of the De$cendent by C A?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I think $o; becau$e in the $ame time that the Cadent
$hall pa$s all C B, the De$cendent $hall pa$s in C A, a part le$s
than C B.</P>
<P>SALV. True; and thus it is proved, that the moveable moves
more $wiftly by the perpendicular, than by the inclination. Now
con$ider, if in this $ame Figure one may any way evince the o-
ther conceipt, and finde that the moveables were equally $wift
by both the lines C A and C B.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I $ee no $uch thing; nay rather it $eems to contradict
what was $aid before.</P>
<P>SALV. And what $ay you, <I>Sagredus</I>? I would not teach you
what you knew before, and that of which but ju$t now you pro-
duced me the definition.</P>
<P>SAGR. The definition I gave you, was, that moveables may
be called equally $wift, when the $paces pa$$ed are proportional
to the times in which they pa$$ed; therefore to apply the defini-
tion to the pre$ent ca$e, it will be requi$ite, that the time of de-
$cent by C A, to the time of falling by C B, $hould have the
$ame proportion that the line C A hath to the line C B; but I
under$tand not how that can be, for that the motion by C B is
$wifter than by C A.</P>
<P>SALV. And yet you mu$t of nece$$ity know it. Tell me a little,
do not the$e motions go continually accelerating?</P>
<P>SAGR. They do; but more in the perpendicular than in the
inclination.</P>
<P>SALV. But this acceleration in the perpendicular, is it yet not-
with$tanding $uch in compari$on of that of the inclined, that
two equal parts being taken in any place of the $aid perpendicu-
lar and inclining lines, the motion in the parts of the perpendicu-
lar is alwaies more $wift, than in the part of the inclination?</P>
<P>SAGR. I $ay not $o: but I could take a $pace in the inclinati-
on, in which the velocity $hall be far greater than in the like $pace
taken in the perpendicular; and this $hall be, if the $pace in the
<foot>perpen-</foot>
<p n=>16</p>
perpendicular $hould be taken near to the end C, and in the in-
clination, far from it.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ee then, that the Propo$ition which $aith, that
the motion by the perpendicular is more $wift than by the incli-
nation, holds not true univer$ally, but onely of the motions,
which begin from the extremity, namely from the point of re$t:
without which re$triction, the Propo$ition would be $o deficient,
that its very direct contrary might be true; namely, that the mo-
tion in the inclining plane is $wifter than in the perpendicular:
for it is certain, that in the $aid inclination, we may take a $pace
pa$t by the moveable in le$s time, than the like $pace pa$t in the
perpendicular. Now becau$e the motion in the inclination is in
$ome places more, in $ome le$s, than in the perpendicular; there-
fore in $ome places of the inclination, the time of motion of the
moveable, $hall have a greater proportion to the time of the motion
of the moveable, by $ome places of the perpendicular, than the
$pace pa$$ed, to the $pace pa$$ed: and in other places, the pro-
portion of the time to the time, $hall be le$s than that of the
$pace to the $pace. As for example: two moveables departing
from their quie$cence, namely, from the point C, one by the per-
pendicular C B, [in <I>Fig.</I> 4.] and the other by the inclination C A,
in the time that, in the perpendicular, the moveable $hall have
pa$t all C B, the other $hall have pa$t C T le$$er. And therefore
the time by C T, to the time by C B (which is equal) $hall have
a greater proportion than the line C T to C B, being that the
<I>$ame</I> to the <I>le$s,</I> hath a greater proportion than to the <I>greater.</I>
And on the contrary, if in C A, prolonged as much as is requi-
$ite, one $hould take a part equal to C B, but pa$t in a $horter
time; the time in the inclination $hall have a le$s proportion to
the time in the perpendicular, than the $pace to the $pace. If
therefore in the inclination and perpendicular, we may $uppo$e
$uch $paces and velocities, that the proportion between the $aid
$paces be greater and le$s than the proportion of the times; we
may ea$ily grant, that there are al$o $paces, by which the times
of the motions retain the $ame proportion as the $paces.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am already freed from my greate$t doubt, and con-
ceive that to be not onely po$$ible, but nece$$ary, which I but
now thought a contradiction: but neverthele$s I under$tand not
as yet, that this whereof we now are $peaking, is one of the$e
po$$ible or nece$$ary ca$es; $o as that it $hould be true, that the
time of de$cent by C A, to the time of the fall by C B, hath the
$ame proportion that the line C A hath to C B; whence it may
without contradiction be affirmed, that the velocity by the incli-
nation C A, and by the perpendicular C B, are equal.</P>
<P>SALV. Content your $elf for this time, that I have removed
<foot>your</foot>
<p n=>17</p>
your incredulity; but for the knowledge of this, expect it at
$ome other time, namely, when you $hall $ee the matters concer-
ning local motion demon$trated by our <I>Academick</I>; at which
time you $hall find it proved, that in the time that the one movea-
ble falls all the $pace C B, the other de$cendeth by C A as far
as the point T, in which falls the perpendicular drawn from the
point B: and to find where the $ame Cadent by the perpendi-
cular would be when the other arriveth at the point A, draw from
A the perpendicular unto C A, continuing it, and C B unto the
interfection, and that $hall be the point $ought. Whereby you
$ee how it is true, that the motion by C B is $wifter than by the
inclination C A ($uppo$ing the term C for the beginning of the
motions compared) becau$e the line C B is greater than C T,
and the other from C unto the inter$ection of the perpendicular
drawn from A, unto the line C A, is greater than C A, and
therefore the motion by it is $wifter than by C A But when we
compare the motion made by all C A, not with all the motion
made in the $ame time by the perpendicular continued, but with
that made in part of the time, by the $ole part C B, it hinders
not, that the motion by C A, continuing to de$cend beyond, may
arrive to A in $uch a time as is in proportion to the other time,
as the line C A is to the line C B. Now returning to our fir$t
purpo$e; which was to $hew, that the grave moveable leaving
its quie$cence, pa$$eth defcending by all the degrees of tardity,
precedent to any what$oever degree of velocity that it aequireth,
re-a$$uming the $ame Figure which we u$ed before, let us remem-
ber that we did agree, that the De$cendent by the inclination C
A, and the Cadent by the perpendicular C B, were found to have
acquired equal degrees of velocity in the terms B and A: now to
proceed, I $uppo$e you will not $cruple to grant, that upon ano-
ther plane le$s $teep than A C; as for example, A D [in <I>Fig.</I> 5.]
the motion of the de$cendent would be yet more $low than in the
plane A C. So that it is not any whit dubitable, but that there
may be planes $o little elevated above the Horizon A B, that the
moveable, namely the $ame ball, in any the longe$t time may
reach the point A, which being to move by the plane A B, an infi-
nite time would not $uffice: and the motion is made always more
$lowly, by how much the declination is le$s. It mu$t be therefore
confe$t, that there may be a point taken upon the term B, $o near
to the $aid B, that drawing from thence to the point A a plane,
the ball would not pa$s it in a whole year. It is requi$ite next
for you to know, that the <I>impetus,</I> namely the degree of velo-
city the ball is found to have acquired when it arriveth at the
point A, is $uch, that $hould it continue to move with this $elf-$ame
degree uniformly, that is to $ay, without accelerating or retarding;
<foot>C in</foot>
<p n=>18</p>
in as much more time as it was in coming by the inclining plane, it
would pa$s double the $pace of the plane inclined: namely (for
example) if the ball had pa$t the plane D A in an hour, con-
tinuing to move uniformly with that degree of velocity which it
is found to have in its arriving at the term A, it $hall pa$s in an
hour a $pace double the length D A; and becau$e (as we have
$aid) the degrees of velocity acquired in the points B and A, by
the moveables that depart from any point taken in the perpendicu-
lar C B, and that de$cend, the one by the inclined plane, the o-
ther by the $aid perpendicular, are always equal: therefore the
cadent by the perpendicular may depart from a term $o near to B,
that the degree of velocity acquired in B, would not $uffice ($till
maintaining the $ame) to conduct the moveable by a $pace dou-
ble the length of the plane inclined in a year, nor in ten, no nor
in a hundred. We may therefore conclude, that if it be true,
that according to the ordinary cour$e of nature a moveable, all
external and accidental impediments removed, moves upon an in-
clining plane with greater and greater tardity, according as the
inclination $hall be le$s; $o that in the end the tardity comes to be
infinite, which is, when the inclination concludeth in, and joyneth
to the horizontal plane; and if it be true likewi$e, that the de-
gree of velocity acquired in $ome point of the inclined plane, is
equal to that degree of velocity which is found to be in the move-
able that de$cends by the perpendicular, in the point cut by a
parallel to the Horizon, which pa$$eth by that point of the incli-
ning plane; it mu$t of nece$$ity be granted, that the cadent de-
parting from re$t, pa$$eth thorow all the infinite degrees of tar-
dity, and that con$equently, to acquire a determinate degree of
velocity, it is nece$$ary that it move fir$t by right lines, de$cend-
ing by a $hort or long $pace, according as the velocity to be acqui-
red, ought to be either le$s or greater, and according as the plane
on which it de$cendeth is more or le$s inclined; $o that a plane
may be given with $o $mall inclination, that to acquire in it the
a$$igned degree of velocity, it mu$t fir$t move in a very great $pace,
and take a very long time; whereupon in the horizontal plane, any
how little $oever velocity, would never be naturally acquired,
$ince that the moveable in this ca$e will never move: but the

motion by the horizontal line, which is neither declined or incli-
ned, is a circular motion about the centre: therefore the circu-
lar motion is never acquired naturally, without the right motion
precede it; but being once acquired, it will continue perpetually
with uniform velocity. I could with other di$cour$es evince and
demon$trate the $ame truth, but I will not by $o great a digre$-
fion interrupt our principal argument: but rather will return to
it upon $ome other occa$ion; e$pecially $ince we now a$$umed the
<foot>$ame</foot>
<p n=>19</p>
$ame, not to $erve for a nece$$ary demon$tration, but to adorn a
<I>Platonick</I> Conceit; to which I will add another particular ob$er-
vation of our <I>Academick,</I> which hath in it $omething of admira-
ble. Let us $uppo$e among$t the decrees of the divine <I>Architect,</I>
a purpo$e of creating in the World the$e Globes, which we be-
hold continually moving round, and of a$$igning the centre of
their conver$ions; and that in it he had placed the Sun immoveable,
and had afterwards made all the $aid Globes in the $ame place,
and with the intended inclinations of moving towards the Centre,
till they had acquired tho$e degrees of velocity, which at fir$t $ee-
med good to the $ame Divine Minde; the which being acquired,
we la$tly $uppo$e that they were turned round, each in his Sphere
retaining the $aid acquired velocity: it is now demanded, in
what altitude and di$tance from the Sun the place was where the
$aid Orbs were primarily created; and whether it be po$$ible that
they might all be created in the $ame place? To make this inve-
$tigation, we mu$t take from the mo$t skilfull A$tronomers the
magnitude of the Spheres in which the Planets revolve, and like-
wi$e the time of their revolutions: from which two cognitions is
gathered how much (for example) <I>Jupiter</I> is $wifter than <I>Sa-
turne</I>; and being found (as indeed it is) that <I>Jupiter</I> moves more
$wiftly, it is requi$ite, that departing from the $ame altitude, <I>Ju-
piter</I> be de$cended more than <I>Saturne,</I> as we really know it is, its
Orbe being inferiour to that of <I>Saturne.</I> But by proceeding for-
wards, from the proportions of the two velocities of <I>Jupiter</I> and
<I>Saturne,</I> and from the di$tance between their Orbs, and from the
proportion of acceleration of natural motion, one may finde in
what altitude and di$tance from the centre of their revolutions,
<marg><I>The magnitude of
the Orbs, and the
velocity of the mo-
tion of the Planets,
an$wer proportion-
ably, as if de$cend-
ed from the $ame
place.</I></marg>
was the place from whence they fir$t departed. This found out,
and agreed upon, it is to be $ought, whether <I>Mars</I> de$cending
from thence to his Orb, the magnitude of the Orb, and the ve-
locity of the motion, agree with that which is found by calcula-
tion; and let the like be done of the <I>Eartb,</I> of <I>Venus,</I> and of
<I>Mercury</I>; the greatne$s of which Spheres, and the velocity of
their motions, agree $o nearly to what computation gives, that it
is very admirable.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have hearkened to this conceit with extreme delight;
and, but that I believe the making of the$e calculations truly
would be a long and painfull task, and perhaps too hard for me
to comprehend, I would make a trial of them.</P>
<P>SALV. The operation indeed is long and difficult; nor could
I be certain to finde it $o readily; therefore we $hall refer it to an-
other time, and for the pre$ent we will return to our fir$t propo-
$al, going on there where we made digre$$ion; which, if I well
remember, was about the proving the motion by a right line of no
<foot>C 2 u$e,</foot>
<p n=>20</p>
u$e, in the ordinate parts of the World; and we did proceed to
$ay, that it was not $o in circular motions, of which that which is
made by the moveable in it $elf, $till retains it in the $ame place,
<marg><I>Finite and termi-
nate circular mo-
tions di$order not
the parts of the
World.</I></marg>
and that which carrieth the moveable by the circumference of a
circle about its fixed centre, neither puts it $elf, nor tho$e about it
in di$order; for that $uch a motion primarily is finite and terminate
(though not yet fini$hed and determined) but there is no point
<marg><I>In the circular mo-
tion, every point in
the circumference
is the begining and
end.</I></marg>
in the circumference, that is not the fir$t and la$t term in the cir-
culation; and continuing it in the circumference a$$igned it, it
leaveth all the re$t, within and without that, free for the u$e of
others, without ever impeding or di$ordering them. This being
a motion that makes the moveable continually leave, and con-
<marg><I>Circular motion
onely is uniform.</I></marg>
tinually arrive at the end; it alone therefore can primarily be u-
niform; for that acceleration of motion is made in the moveable,
when it goeth towards the term, to which it hath inclination;
and the retardation happens by the repugnance that it hath to
leave and part from the $ame term; and becau$e in circular mo-
tion, the moveable continually leaves the natural term, and con-
tinually moveth towards the $ame, therefore, in it, the repug-
nance and inclination are always of equal force: from which e-
quality re$ults a velocity, neither retarded nor accelerated, <I>i. e.</I> an
uniformity in motion. From this conformity, and from the being
<marg><I>Circular motion
may be continued
perpetually.</I></marg>
terminate, may follow the perpetual continuation by $ucce$$ively
reiterating the circulations; which in an undeterminated line,
and in a motion continually retarded or accelerated, cannot na-

turally be. I $ay, naturally; becau$e the right motion which is
retarded, is the violent, which cannot be perpetual; and the ac-
celerate arriveth nece$$arily at the term, if one there be; and if
there be none, it cannot be moved to it, becau$e nature moves
not whether it is impo$$ible to attain. I conclude therefore, that
the circular motion can onely naturally con$i$t with natural bo-
dies, parts of the univer$e, and con$tituted in an excellent di$po-
$ure; and that the right, at the mo$t that can be $aid for it, is
<marg><I>Right motion a$-

a$$igned by nature to its bodies, and their parts, at $uch time as
they $hall be out of their proper places, con$tituted in a depraved
di$po$ition, and for that cau$e needing to be redured by the $hort-
e$t way to their natural $tate. Hence, me thinks, it may ratio-
nally be concluded, that for maintenance of perfect order among $t
the parts of the World, it is nece$$ary to $ay, that moveables are
moveable onely circularly; and if there be any that move not
<marg><I>Re$t onely, and
circular motion are
apt to con$erve or-
der.</I></marg>
circularly, the$e of nece$$ity are immoveable: there being no-
thing but re$t and circular motion apt to the con$ervation of or-
der. And I do not a little wonder with my $elf, that <I>Ari$totle,</I>
who held that the Terre$trial globe was placed in the centre of
the World, and there remained immoveable, $hould not $ay, that
<foot>of</foot>

<P>SALV. The mo$t that you can pretend from this your Di$-

Earth removed from the whole, namely, from the place where

$it ratio totius &amp; partium</I>) $o it may be inferred, that the
Terre$trial Globe removed violently from the place a$$igned
<marg><I>It is que$tionable
whether de$cending
weights move in a
right line.</I></marg>
it by nature, it would return by a right line. This, as I have
$aid, is the mo$t that can be granted you, and that onely for want
of examination; but he that $hall with exactne$s revi$e the$e
things, will fir$t deny, that the parts of the Earth, in returning to
its whole, move in a right line, and not by a circular or mixt; and
really you would have enough to do to demon$trate the contra-
ry, as you $hall plainly $ee in the an$wers to the particular rea$ons
and experiments alledged by <I>Ptolomey</I> and <I>Ari$totle.</I> Secondly,
If another $hould $ay that the <I>parts</I> of the Earth, go not in their
motion towards the Centre of the World, but to unite with its
<I>Whole,</I> and that for that rea$on they naturally incline towards the
centre of the Terre$trial Globe, by which inclination they con-
$pire to form and pre$erve it, what other <I>All,</I> or what other Centre
would you find for the World, to which the whole Terrene
<marg><I>The Earth speri-
cal by the con$pi-
ration of its parts
to its Centre.</I></marg>
Globe, being thence removed, would $eek to return, that $o the
rea$on of the <I>Whole</I> might be like to that of its <I>parts</I>? It may be
added, That neither <I>Ari$totle,</I> nor you can ever prove, that the
Earth <I>de facto</I> is in the centre of the Univer$e; but if any Centre
<foot>may</foot>
<p n=>22</p>
<marg><I>The Sun more pro-
bably in the centre
of the Vniver$e,
than the Earth.</I></marg>
may be a$ligned to the Univer$e, we $hall rather find the Sun
placed in it, as by the $equel you $hall under$tand.</P>
<P>Now, like as from the con$entaneous con$piration of all the
parts of the Earth to form its whole, doth follow, that they with
<marg><I>Natural inclina-
tion of the parts of
all the globes of
the World to go to
their centre.</I></marg>
equal inclination concurr thither from all parts; and to unite
them$elves as much as is po$$ible together, they there $phelically
adapt them$elves; why may we not believe that the Sun, Moon,
and other mundane Bodies, be al$o of a round figure, not by o-
ther than a concordant in$tinct, and natural concour$e of all the
parts compo$ing them? Of which, if any, at any time, by any
violence were $eparated from the whole, is it not rea$onable to
think, that they would $pontaneou$ly and by natural in$tinct re-
turn? and in this manner to infer, that the right motion agreeth
with all mundane bodies alike.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Certainly, if you in this manner deny not onely the
Principles of Sciences, but manife$t Experience, and the Sen$es
them$elves, you can never be convinced or removed from any o-
pinion which you once conceit, therefore I will choo$e rather to
be $ilent (for, <I>contra negantes principia non e$t di$putandum</I>)
than contend with you. And in$i$ting on the things alledged by
you even now ($ince you que$tion $o much as whether grave move-
ables have a right motion or no) how can you ever rationally de-
<marg><I>The right motion
of grave bodies
manife$t to $en$e.</I></marg>
ny, that the parts of the Earth; or, if you will, that ponderous
matters de$cend towards the Centre, with a right motion; when-
as, if from a very high Tower, who$e walls are vcry upright and
perpendicular, you let them fall, they $hall de$cend gliding and
$liding by the Tower to the Earth, exactly in that very place
where a plummet would fall, being hanged by a line fa$tned above,
ju$t there, whence the $aid weights were let fall? is not this a
more than evident argument of the motions being right, and to-
<marg><I>Arguments of</I> A-
ri$totle, <I>to prove
that grave bodies
move with an in-
clination to arrive
at the centre of the
Vniver$e.</I></marg>
wards the Centre? In the $econd place you call in doubt, whe-
ther the parts of the Earth are moved, as <I>Ari$totle</I> affirms, to-
wards the Centre of the World; as if he had not rationally de-
mon$trated it by contrary motions, whil$t he thus argueth; The
motion of heavie bodies is contrary to that of the light: but the
motion of the light is manife$t to be directly upwards, namely,
towards the circumference of the World, therefore the motion of
the heavie is directly towards the Centre of the World: and it
<marg><I>Heavie bodies
move towards the
centre of the Earth</I>
per accidens.</marg>
happens <I>per accidens,</I> that it be towards the centre of the Earth,
for that this $triveth to be united to that. The $eeking in the
next place, what a part of the Globe of the Sun or Moon would
do, were it $eparated from its whole, is vanity; becau$e that there-
<marg><I>To $eek what
would follow upon
an impo$$ibility, is
folly.</I></marg>
by that is $ought, which would be the con$equence of an impo$$i-
bility; in regard that, as <I>Ari$totle</I> al$o demon$trates, the c&oelig;le$tial
bodies are impa$$ible, impenetrable, and infrangible; $o that $uch
<foot>a ca$e</foot>
<p n=>23</p>
a ca$e can never happen: and though it $hould, and that the $e-
<marg><I>C&oelig;le$tial bodies
neither heavie nor
light, according to</I>
Ari$totle.</marg>
parated part $hould return to its whole, it would not return as
grave or light, for that the $ame <I>Ari$totle</I> proveth, that the C&oelig;-
le$tial Bodies are neither heavie nor light.</P>
<P>SALV. With what rea$on I doubt, whether grave bodies move
by a right and perpendicular line, you $hall hear, as I $aid be-
fore, when I $hall examine this particular argument. Touching
the $econd point, I wonder that you $hould need to di$cover the
<I>Paralogi$m</I> of <I>Ari$totle,</I> being of it $elf $o manife$t; and that
you perceive not, that <I>Ari$totle</I> $uppo$eth that which is in que$ti-
on: therefore take notice.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Pray <I>Salviatus</I> $peak with more re$pect of <I>Ari$totle</I>:
for who can you ever per$wade, that he who was the fir$t, only,
and admirable explainer of the <I>Syllogi$tick</I> forms of demon$tration,
<marg>Ari$totle <I>cannot e-
quivocate, being
the inventer of</I> Lo-
gick.</marg>
of <I>Elenchs,</I> of the manner of di$covering <I>Sophi$ms, Paralogi$ms,</I> and
in $hort, of all the parts of <I>Logick,</I> $hould afterwards $o notoriou$ly
equivocate in impo$ing that for known, which is in que$tion? It
would be better, my Ma$ters, fir$t perfectly to under$tand him,
and then to try, if you have a minde, to oppo$e him.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Simplicius,</I> we are here familiarly di$cour$ing among
our $elves, to inve$tigate $ome truth; I $hall not be di$plea$ed
that you di$cover my errors; and if I do not follow the mind of
<I>Ari$totle,</I> freely reprehend me, and I $hall take it in good part.
Onely give me leave to expound my doubts, and to reply $ome-
thing to your la$t words, telling you, that <I>Logick,</I> as it is well
under$tood, is the Organe with which we philo$ophate; but as it
may be po$$ible, that an Arti$t may be excellent in making Or-
gans, but unlearned in playing on them, thus he might be a great
Logician, but unexpert in making u$e of <I>Logick</I>; like as we have
many that theorically under$tand the whole Art of Poetry, and
yet are unfortunate in compo$ing but meer four Ver$es; others
<marg>* A famous <I>Italian</I>
Painter.</marg>
enjoy all the precepts of <I>Vinci</I>^{*}, and yet know not how to paint
a Stoole. The playing on the Organs is not taught by them who
know how to make Organs, but by him that knows how to play
on them: Poetry is learnt by continual reading of Poets: Limn-
ing is learnt by continual painting and de$igning: Demon$tration
from the reading of Books full of demon$trations, which are the
Mathematical onely, and not the Logical. Now returning to our
purpo$e, I $ay, that that which <I>Ari$totle</I> $eeth of the motion of
light bodies, is the departing of the Fire from any part of the
Superficies of the Terre$trial Globe, and directly retreating from
it, mounting upwards; and this indeed is to move towards a
circumference greater than that of the Earth; yea, the $ame <I>A-
ri$totle</I> makes it to move to the concave of the Moon, but that
this circumference is that of the World, or concentrick to it, $o
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>24</p>
that to move towards this, is a moving towards that of the World,
that he cannot affirm, unle$s he $uppo$eth, That the Centre of the
<marg><I>Paralogi$m of</I> A-
ri$totle, <I>in proving
the Earth to be in
the Centre of the
World.</I></marg>
Earth, from which we $ee the$e light a$cendent bodies to depart,
be the $ame with the Centre of the World; which is as much as
to $ay, that the terre$trial Globe is con$tituted in the mid$t of the
World: which is yet that of which we were in doubt, and which
<I>Aristotle</I> intended to prove. And do you $ay that this is not a
<marg><I>The Paralogi$me
of</I> Ari$totle <I>another
way di$covered.</I></marg>
manife$t <I>Paralogi$m</I>?</P>
<P>SAGR. This Argument of <I>Ari$totle</I> appeared to me deficient
al$o, and <I>non</I>-concludent for another re$pect; though it were
granted, that that Circumference, to which the Fire directly mo-
veth, be that which includeth the World: for that in a circle,
not onely the centre, but any other point being taken, every move-
able which departing thence, $hall move in a right line, and to-
wards any what$oever part, $hall without any doubt go towards
the circumference, and continuing the motion, $hall al$o arrive
thither; $o that we may truly $ay, that it moveth towards the
circumference: but yet it doth not follow, that that which mo-
veth by the $ame line with a contrary motion, would go towards
the centre, unle$s when the point taken were the centre it $elf,
or that the motion were made by that onely line, which produced
from the point a$$igned, pa$$eth thorow the centre. So that to
$ay, that Fire moving in a right line, goeth towards the circumfe-
rence of the World, therefore the parts of the Earth which by
the $ame lines move with a contrary motion, go towards the cen-
tre of the World, concludeth not, unle$s then when it is pre-
$uppo$ed, that the lines of the Fire prolonged pa$s by the centre
of the World; and becau$e we know certainly of them, that they
pa$s by the centre of the Terre$trial Globe (being perpendicu-
lar to its $uperficies, and not inclined) therefore to conclude, it
mu$t be $uppo$ed, that the centre of the Earth is the $ame with
the centre of the World; or at lea$t, that the parts of the Fire
and Earth de$cend not, $ave onely by one $ole line which pa$$eth
by the centre of the World. Which neverthele$s is fal$e, and re-
pugnant to experience, which $heweth us, that the parts of
Fire, not by one line onely, but by infinite, produced from the
centre of the Earth towards all the parts of the World, a$cend
always by lines perpendicular to the Superficies of the Terre$tri-
al Globe.</P>
<P>SALV. You do very ingeniou$ly lead <I>Ari$totle</I> to the $ame in-
convenience, <I>Sagredus,</I> $hewing his manife$t equivoke; but
withal you add another incon$i$tency. We $ee the Earth to be
$pherical, and therefore are certain that it hath its centre, to which
we $ee all its parts are moved; for $o we mu$t $ay, whil$t their
motions are all perpendicular to the Superficies of the Earth; we
<foot>mean,</foot>
<p n=>25</p>
mean, that as they move to the centre of the Earth, they move to
their <I>Whole,</I> and to their Univer$al Mother: and we are $till far-
ther $o free, that we will $uffer our $elves to be per$waded, that
<marg><I>Grave bodies may
more rationally be
affirmed to tend to
the Centre of the
Earth, than of the
Vniver$e.</I></marg>
their natural in$tinct is, not to go towards the centre of the Earth,
but towards that of the Univer$e; which we know not where to
find, or whether it be or no; and were it granted to be, it is but
an imaginary point, and a nothing without any quality. As to
what <I>Simplicius</I> $aid la$t, that the contending whether the parts
of the Sun, Moon, or other c&oelig;le$tial Body, $eparated from their
<I>Whole,</I> $hould naturally return to it, is a vanity, for that the ca$e
is impo$$ible; it being clear by the Demon$trations of <I>Ari$totle,</I>
that the c&oelig;le$tial Bodies are impa$$ible, impenetrable, unparta-
<marg><I>The conditions and
attributes which
differ the c&oelig;le$tial
bodies from Ele-
mentary, depend on
the motions a$$ign-
ed them by</I> Ari$t.</marg>
ble, <I>&amp;c.</I> I an$wer, that none of the conditions, whereby <I>Aristo-
tle</I> di$tingui$heth the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies from Elementary, hath o-
ther foundation than what he deduceth from the diver$ity of the
natural motion of tho$e and the$e; in$omuch that it being deni-
ed, that the circular motion is peculiar to C&oelig;le$tial Bodies, and
affirmed, that it is agreeable to all Bodies naturally moveable, it
is behoofull upon nece$$ary con$equence to $ay, either that the
attributes of generable, or ingenerable, alterable, or unalterable,
partable, or unpartable, <I>&amp;c.</I> equally and commonly agree with
all worldly bodies, namely, as well to the C&oelig;le$tial as to the E-
lementary; or that <I>Ari$totle</I> hath badly and erroneou$ly dedu-
ced tho$e from the circular motion, which he hath a$$igned to C&oelig;-
le$tial Bodies.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This manner of argumentation tends to the $ubver$i-
on of all Natural Philo$ophy, and to the di$order and $ubver$ion
of Heaven and Earth, and the whole Univer$e; but I believe the
Fundamentals of the <I>Peripateticks</I> are $uch, that we need not
fear that new Sciences can be erected upon their ruines.</P>
<P>SALV. Take no thought in this place for Heaven or the Earth,
neither fear their $ubver$ion, or the ruine of Philo$ophy. As to
Heaven, your fears are vain for that which you your $elf hold
unalterable and impa$$ible; as for the Earth, we $trive to enoble
and perfect it, whil$t we make it like to the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies,
and as it were place it in Heaven, whence your Philo$ophers have
exiled it. Philo$ophy it $elf cannot but receive benefit from our
<marg><I>The di$putes and
contradictions of
Philo$ophers may
conduce to the
benefit of Philo$o-
phy.</I></marg>
Di$putes, for if our conceptions prove true, new Di$coveries will
be made; if fal$e, the fir$t Doctrine will be more confirmed.
Rather be$tow your care upon $ome Philo$ophers, and help and
defend them; for as to the Science it $elf, it cannot but improve.
And that we may return to our purpo$e, be plea$ed freely to pro-
duce what pre$ents it $elf to you in confirmation of that great dif-
ference which <I>Ari$totle</I> puts between the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies, and
the Elementary parts of the World, in making tho$e ingenerable,
<foot>D incor-</foot>
<p n=>26</p>
incorruptible, unalterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> and this corruptible, alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. I $ee not yet any need that <I>Ari$totle</I> hath of help,
$tanding as he doth $toutly and $trongly on his feet; yea not be-
ing yet a$$aulted, much le$s foiled by you. And what ward will
you choo$e in this combate for this fir$t blow? <I>Aristotle</I> writeth,
<marg>Ari$totles <I>di$cour$e
to prove the incor-
ruptibility of Hea-
ven.</I></marg>
that whatever is generated, is made out of a contrary in $ome
$ubject, and likewi$e is corrupted in $ome certain $ubject from a
<marg><I>Generation &amp; cor-
ruption is onely a-
mong$t contraries,
according to</I> Ari$t.</marg>
contrary into a contrary; $o that (ob$erve) corruption and ge-
neration is never but onely in contraries; If therefore to a C&oelig;-
le$tial Body no contrary can be a$$igned, for that to the circular
<marg><I>To the circular
motion no other
motion is contrary.</I></marg>
motion no other motion is contrary, then Nature hath done very
well to make that exempt from contraries, which was to be in-
generable and incorruptible, This fundamental fir$t confirmed,
it immediately followeth of con$equence, that it is inaugmenta-
ble, inalterable, impa$$ible, and finally eternal, and a propor-
<marg><I>Heaven an habi-
tation for the imm-
ortal Gods.</I></marg>
tionate habitation to the immortal Deities, conformable to the
opinion even of all men that have any conceit of the Gods. He
<marg><I>Immutability of
Heaven evident to
$ex$e.</I></marg>
afterwards confirmeth the $ame by $en$e; in regard, that in all
times pa$t, according to memory or tradition, we $ee nothing re-
moved, according to the whole outward Heaven, nor any of its
<marg><I>He proveth that
the circular motion
hath no contrary.</I></marg>
proper parts. Next, as to the circular motion, that no other is
contrary to it, <I>Aristotle</I> proveth many ways; but without reci-
ting them all, it is $ufficiently demon$trated, $ince fimple motions
are but three, to the <I>medium,</I> from the <I>medium,</I> and about the
<I>medium,</I> of which the two right, <I>$ur$um</I> and <I>deor$um,</I> are mani-
fe$tly contrary; and becau$e one onely hath onely one for con-
trary, therefore there re$ts no other motion which may be contra-
ry to the circular. You $ee the $ubtle and mo$t concluding di$-
cour$e of <I>Ari$totle,</I> whereby he proveth the incorruptibility of
Heaven.</P>
<P>SALV. This is nothing more, $ave the pure progre$s of <I>Ari$to-
tle,</I> by me hinted before; wherein, be$ides that I affirm, that the
motion which you attribute to the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies agreeth al$o
to the Earth, its illation proves nothing. I tell you therefore,
that that circular motion which you a$$ign to C&oelig;le$tial Bodies,
$uiteth al$o to the Earth, from which, $uppo$ing that the re$t of
your di$cour$e were concludent, will follow one of the$e three
things, as I told you a little before, and $hall repeat; namely,
either that the Earth it $elf is al$o ingenerable, and incorruptible,
as the C&oelig;le$tial bodies; or that the C&oelig;le$tial bodies are, like as
the Elementary generable, alterable &amp;c. or that this difference of
motion hath nothing to do with Generation and Corruption.
The di$cour$e of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and yours al$o contain many Propo$i-
tions not to be lightly admitted, and the better to examine them,
it will be convenient to reduce them to the mo$t ab$tracted and
<foot>di$tinct</foot>
<p n=>27</p>
di$tinct that can be po$$ible; and excu$e me <I>Sagredus,</I> if haply
with $ome tediou$ne$s you hear me oft repeat the $ame things,
and fancie that you $ee me rea$$ume my argument in the pub-
lick circle of Di$putations. You $ay Generation and Corrupti-
on are onely made where there are contraries; contraries
are onely among$t $imple natural bodies, moveable with contrary
motions; contrary motions are onely tho$e which are made by
a right line between contrary terms; and the$e are onely two,
that is to $ay, from the <I>medium,</I> and towards the <I>medium</I>; and
$uch motions belong to no other natural bodies, but to the <I>Earth,</I>
the <I>Fire,</I> and the other two Elements: therefore Generation
and Corruption is onely among$t the Elements. And becau$e
the third $imple motion, namely, the circular about the <I>medium,</I>
hath no contrary, (for that the other two are contraries, and one
onely, hath but onely one contrary) therefore that natural body
with which $uch motion agreeth, wants a contrary; and having
no contrary is ingenerable and incorruptible, &amp;c. Becau$e where
there is no contrariety, there is no generation or corruption, <I>&amp;c.</I>
But $uch motion agreeth onely with the C&oelig;le$tial bodies; there-
<marg><I>Its ea$ier to prove
the Earth to move,
than that corrupti-
on is made by con-
traries.</I></marg>
fore onely the$e are ingenerable, incorruptible, <I>&amp;c.</I> And to
begin, I think it a more ea$ie thing, and $ooner done to re$olve,
whether the Earth (a mo$t va$t Body, and for its vicinity to us,
mo$t tractable) moveth with a $peedy motion, $uch as its revo-
lution about its own axis in twenty four hours would be, than it
is to under$tand and re$olve, whether Generation and Corruption
ari$eth from contrariety, or el$e whether there be $uch things as
generation, corruption and contrariety in nature. And if you,
<I>Simplicius,</I> can tell me what method Nature ob$erves in working,
when $he in a very $hort time begets an infinite number of flies
from a little vapour of the Mu$t of wine, and can $hew me which
are there the contraries you $peak of, what it is that corrupteth,
and how; I $hould think you would do more than I can; for I
profe$s I cannot comprehend the$e things. Be$ides, I would ve-
ry gladly under$tand how, and why the$e corruptive contraries are
$o favourable to Daws, and $o cruel to Doves; $o indulgent to
Stags, and $o ha$ty to Hor$es, that they do grant to them many
more years of life, that is, of incorruptibility, than weeks to the$e.
Peaches and Olives are planted in the $ame $oil, expo$ed to the
$ame heat and cold, to the $ame wind and rains, and, in a word,
to the $ame contrarieties; and yet tho$e decay in a $hort time,
and the$e live many hundred years. Furthermore, I never was
thorowly $atisfied about this $ub$tantial tran$mutation ($till keep-
ing within pure natural bounds) whereby a matter becometh $o
transform'd, that it $hould be nece$$arily $aid to be de$troy'd, $o
that nothing remaineth of its fir$t being, and that another body
<foot>D2 quite</foot>
<p n=>28</p>
<marg><I>Bare tran$po$ition
of parts may repre-
$ent bodies under
diver$e asp cts.</I></marg>
quite differing there-from $hould be thence produced; and if I
fancy to my $elf a body under one a$pect, and by and by under
another very different, I cannot think it impo$$ible but that it may
happen by a $imple tran$po$ition of parts, without corrupting or
ingendring any thing a-new; for we $ee $uch kinds of Metamor-
pho$es dayly: $o that to return to my purpo$e, I an$wer you,
that ina$much as you go about to per$wade me that the Earth can
not move circularly by way of corruptibility and generability,
you have undertook a much harder task than I, that with argu-
ments more difficult indeed, but no le$s concluding, will prove
the contrary.</P>
<P>SAGR. Pardon me, <I>Salviatus,</I> if I interrupt your di$cour$e,
which, as it delights me much, for that I al$o am gravel'd with
the $ame doubts; $o I fear that you can never conclude the $ame,
without altogether digre$$ing from your chief de$ign: therefore
if it be permitted to proceed in our fir$t argument, I $hould think
that it were convenient to remit this que$tion of generation and
corruption to another di$tinct and $ingle conference; as al$o, if
it $hall plea$e you and <I>Simplicius,</I> we may do by other particular
que$tions which may fall in the way of our di$cour$e; which I
will keep in my mind to propo$e, and exactly di$cu$s them $ome
other time. Now as for the pre$ent, $ince you $ay, that if <I>Ari-
$totle</I> deny circular motion to the Earth in common with other
bodies C&oelig;le$tial, it chence will follow, that the $ame which be-
falleth the Earth, <*> to ito being generable, alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> will
hold al$o of Heaven, let us enquire no further if there be $uch
things in nature, as generation and corruption, or not; but let
us return to enquire what the Globe of the Earth doth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I cannot $uffer my ears to hear it que$tion'd, whether
generation and corruption be in <I>rerum natur&agrave;,</I> it being a thing
which we have continually before our eyes, and whereof <I>Ari$totle</I>
<marg><I>By denying Prin-
ciples in the Scien-
ces, any Paradox
may be maintain-
ed.</I></marg>
hath written two whole Books. But if you go about to deny the
Principles of Sciences, and que$tion things mo$t manife$t, who
knows not, but that you may prove what you will, and maintain
any <I>Paradox</I>? And if you do not dayly $ee herbs, plants, ani-
mals to generate and corrupt, what is it that you do $ee? Al$o,
do you not continually behold contrarieties contend together,
and the Earth change into Water, the Water turn to Air, the
Air into Fire, and again the Air to conden$e into Clouds, Rains,
Hails and Storms?</P>
<P>SAGR. Yes, we $ee the$e things indeed, and therefore will
grant you the di$cour$e of <I>Ari$totle,</I> as to this part of generation
and corruption made by contraries; but if I $hall conclude by
virtue of the $ame propo$itions which are granted to <I>Ari$totle,</I>
that the C&oelig;le$tial bodies them$elves are al$o generable and cor-
<foot>ruptible</foot>
<p n=>29</p>
ruptible, a$well as the Elementary, what will you $ay then?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will $ay you have done that which is impo$$ible to

<P>SAGR. Well then, if this be true, and it be al$o granted,
that C&oelig;le$tial Bodies are ingenerable and incorruptible; I prove
that of nece$$ity C&oelig;le$tial Bodies mu$t be generable and corru-
ptible.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This mu$t needs be a <I>Sophi$m.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Hear my Argument, and then cen$ure and re$olve it.
<marg><I>C&oelig;lestial Bodies
are generable and
corruptible, be-
cau$e they are in-
generable and in-
corruptible.</I></marg>
C&oelig;le$tial Bodies, for that they are ingenerable and incorruptible,
have in Nature their contraries, which are tho$e Bodies that be
generable and corruptible; but where there is contrariety, there
is al$o generation and corruption; therefore C&oelig;le$tial Bodies are
generable and corruptible.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Did I not $ay it could be no other than a <I>Sophi$m</I>?
This is one of tho$e forked Arguments called <I>Sorit&aelig;</I>: like that
<marg><I>The forked Syllo-
gi$m cal'd</I> <G>*cwri/h<*>hs.</G></marg>
of the <I>Cretan,</I> who $aid that all <I>Cretans</I> were lyars; but he as
being a <I>Cretan,</I> had told a lye, in $aying that the <I>Cretans</I> were ly-
ars; it followed therefore, that the <I>Cretans</I> were no lyars, and
con$equently that he, as being a <I>Cretan,</I> had $poke truth: And
yet in $aying the <I>Cretans</I> were lyars, he had $aid true, and com-
prehending him$elf as a <I>Cretan,</I> he mu$t con$equently be a lyar.
And thus in the$e kinds of <I>Sophi$ms</I> a man may dwell to eternity,
and never come to any conclu$ion.</P>
<P>SAGR. You have hitherto cen$ured it, it remaineth now that
you an$wer it, $hewing the fallacie.</P>
<P>SIMPL. As to the re$olving of it, and finding out its fallacie,
do you not in the fir$t place $ee a manife$t contradiction in it?
C&oelig;le$tial Bodies are ingenerable and incorruptible; <I>Ergo,</I> C&oelig;le-
$tial Bodies are generable and corruptible. And again, the con-
<marg><I>Among$t C&oelig;le$tial
Bodies there is no
contrariety.</I></marg>
trariety is not betwixt the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies, but betwixt the E-
lements, which have the contrariety of the Motions, <I>$ur$&ugrave;m</I> and
<I>deor$&ugrave;m,</I> and of levity and gravity; But the Heavens which move
circularly, to which motion no other motion is contrary, want
contrariety, and therefore they are incorruptible.</P>
<P>SAGR. Fair and $oftly, <I>Simplicius</I>; this contrariety whereby
you $ay $ome $imple Bodies become corruptible, re$ides it in the
$ame Body which is corrupted, or el$e hath it relation to $ome o-
other? I $ay, for example, the humidity by which a piece of Earth
<foot>is</foot>
<p n=>30</p>
is corrupted, re$ides it in the $ame Earth or in $ome other bodie,
which mu$t either be the Air or Water? I believe you will grant,
that like as the Motions upwards and downwards, and gravity
and levity, which you make the fir$t contraries, cannot be in the
$ame Subject, $o neither can moi$t and dry, hot and cold: you
mu$t therefore con$equently acknowledg that when a bodie cor-
<marg><I>Contraries which
are the cau$es of
corruption, re$ide
not in the $ame bo-
dy that corrupteth.</I></marg>
rupteth, it is occa$ioned by $ome quality re$iding in another con-
trary to its own: therefore to make the C&oelig;le$tial Body become
corruptible, it $ufficeth that there are in Nature, bodies that have
a contrariety to that C&oelig;le$tial body; and $uch are the Elements,
if it be true that corruptibility be contrary to incorruptibility.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This $ufficeth not, Sir; The Elements alter and cor-
rupt, becau$e they are intermixed, and are joyn'd to one another,
<marg><I>C&oelig;le$tial Bodies
touch, but are not
touched by the E-
lements.</I></marg>
and $o may exerci$e their contrariety; but C&oelig;le$tial bodies are
$eparated from the Elements, by which they are not $o much as
toucht, though indeed they have an influence upon the Elements.
It is requi$ite, if you will prove generation and corruption in C&oelig;-
le$tial bodies, that you $hew, that there re$ides contrarieties be-
tween them.</P>
<P>SAGR. See how I will find tho$e contrarieties between them.
The fir$t fountain from whence you derive the contrariety of the
Elements, is the contrariety of their motions upwards and down-
wards: it therefore is nece$$ary that tho$e Principles be in like
<marg><I>Gravity &amp; levity,
varity and den$ity,
are contrary qua-
lities.</I></marg>
manner contraries to each other, upon which tho$e motions de-
pend. and becau$e that is moveable upwards by lightne$s,
and this downwards by gravitv, it is nece$$ary that lightne$s and
gravity are contrary to each other: no le$s are we to believe tho$e
other Principles to be contraries, which are the cau$es that this is
heavy, and that light: but by your own confe$$ion, levity and
gravity follow as con$equents of rarity and den$ity; therefore
<marg><I>The $tars infinitely
$urpa$s the $ub-
$tance of the re$t of
Heaven in den$ity.</I></marg>
rarity and den$ity $hall be contraries: the which conditions or
affections are $o amply found in C&oelig;le$tial bodies, that you e-
$teem the $tars to be onely more den$e parts of their Heaven:
and if this be $o, it followeth that the den$ity of the $tars exceeds
that of the re$t of Heaven, by almo$t infinite degrees:
which is manife$t, in that Heaven is infinitely tran$parent, and
the $tars extremely opacous; and for that there are there above
no other qualities, but more and le$s den$ity and rarity, which
may be cau$es of the greater or le$s tran$parency. There being
then $uch contrariety between the C&oelig;leftial bodies, it is nece$$ary
that they al$o be generable and corruptible, in the $ame manner
as the Elementary bodies are; or el$e that contrariety is not the
<marg><I>Rarity &amp; den$ity
in C&oelig;le$tial bodies,
is different from
the rarity &amp; den-
$ity of the elements.</I></marg>
cau$e of corruptibility, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. There is no nece$$ity either of one or the other, for
that den$ity and rarity in C&oelig;le$tial bodies, are not contraries to
<foot>each</foot>
<p n=>31</p>
each other, as in Elementary bodies; for that they depend not
on the primary qualities, cold and heat, which are contraries; but
on the more or le$s matter in proportion to quantity: now much
and little, $peak onely a relative oppo$ition, that is, the lea$t of
oppo$itions, and which hath nothing to do with generation and
corruption.</P>
<P>SAGR. Therefore affirming, that den$ity and rarity, which a-
mong$t the Elements $hould be the cau$e of gravity and levity,
which may be the cau$es of contrary motions <I>$ur$&ugrave;m</I> and <I>deor-
$&ugrave;m,</I> on which, again, dependeth the contrarieties for generation
and corruption; it $ufficeth not that they be tho$e den$ne$$es and
rarene$$es which under the $ame quantity, or (if you will) ma$s
contain much or little matter, but it is nece$$ary that they be den$-
ne$$es and rarene$$es cau$ed by the primary qualities, hot and
cold, otherwi$e they would operate nothing at all: but if this be
$o, <I>Ari$totle</I> hath deceived us, for that he $hould have told it us at
<marg>Ari$totle <I>defective
in a$$igning the
cau$es why the ele-
ments are genera-
ble &amp; corruptible.</I></marg>
fir$t, and $o have left written that tho$e $imple bodies are gene-
rable and corruptible, that are moveable with $imple motions
upwards and downwards, dependent on levity and gravity, cau-
$ed by rarity and den$ity, made by much or little matter, by
rea$on of heat and cold; and not to have $taid at the $imple mo-
tion <I>$ur$&ugrave;m</I> and <I>deor$&ugrave;m</I>: for I a$$ure you that to the making
of bodies heavy or light, whereby they come to be moved with
contrary motions, any kind of den$ity and rarity $ufficeth, whe-
ther it proceed from heat and cold, or what el$e you plea$e; for
heat and cold have nothing to do in this affair: and you $hall
upon experiment find, that a red hot iron, which you mu$t grant
to have heat, weigheth as much, and moves in the $ame manner
as when it is cold. But to overpa$s this al$o, how know you but
that C&oelig;le$tial rarity and den$ity depend on heat and cold?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I know it, becau$e tho$e qualities are not among$t
C&oelig;le$tial bodies, which are neither hot nor cold.</P>
<P>SALV. I $ee we are again going about to engulph our $elves in
a bottomle$s ocean, where there is no getting to $hore; for this
is a Navigation without Compa$s, Stars, Oars or Rudder: $o that
it will follow either that we be forced to pa$s from Shelf to Shelf,
or run on ground, or to $ail continually in danger of being lo$t.
Therefore, if according to your advice we $hall proceed in our
main de$ign, we mu$t of nece$$ity for the pre$ent overpa$s this
general con$ideration, whether direct motion be nece$$ary in Na-
ture, and agree with $ome bodies; and come to the particular
demon$trations, ob$ervations and experiments; propounding in
the fir$t place all tho$e that have been hitherto alledged by <I>Ari-
$totle, Ptolomey,</I> and others, to prove the $tability of the Earth, en-
deavouring in the next place to an$wer them: and producing in
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>32</p>
the la$t place, tho$e, by which others may be per$waded, that the
Earth is no le$s than the Moon, or any other Planet to be num-
bered among$t natural bodies that move circularly.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $hall the more willingly incline to this, in that I am
better $atisfied with your Architectonical and general di$cour$e,
than with that of <I>Ari$totle,</I> for yours convinceth me without the
lea$t $cruple, and the other at every $tep cro$$eth my way with
$ome block. And I $ee no rea$on why <I>Simplicius</I> $hould not be
pre$ently $atisfied with the Argument you alledg, to prove that
there can be no $uch thing in nature as a motion by a right line,
if we do but pre$uppo$e that the parts of the Univer$e are di$po-
$ed in an excellent con$titution and perfect order.</P>
<P>SALV. Stay a little, good <I>Sagredus,</I> for ju$t now a way comes
into my mind, how I may give <I>Simplicius</I> $atisfaction, provided
that he will not be $o $trictly wedded to every expre$$ion of <I>A-
ri$totle,</I> as to hold it here$ie to recede in any thing from him. Nor
is there any que$tion to be made, but that if we grant the excel-
lent di$po$ition and perfect order of the parts of the Univer$e,
as to local $cituation, that then there is no other but the circular
motion, and re$t; for as to the motion by a right line, I $ee not
how it can be of u$e for any thing, but to reduce to their natural
con$titution, $ome integral bodies, that by $ome accident were re-
mov'd and $eparated from their whole, as we $aid above.</P>
<P>Let us now con$ider the whole Terre$trial Globe, and enquire
the be$t we can, whether it, and the other Mundane bodies are to
con$erve them$elves in their perfect and natural di$po$ition. It
is nece$$ary to $ay, either that it re$ts and keeps perpetually im-
moveable in its place; or el$e that continuing always in its place,
it revolves in its $elf; or that it turneth about a Centre, moving
<marg>Ari$t. <I>&amp;</I> Ptolomey
<I>make the Terre-
strial Globe immo-
veable.</I></marg>
by the circumference of a circle. Of which accidents, both <I>Ari-
$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomey,</I> and all their followers $ay, that it hath ever
ob$erved, and $hall continually keep the fir$t, that is, a perpetual
<marg><I>It is better to $ay,
that the Terre$tri-
al Globe naturally
resteth, than that
it moveth directly
downwards.</I></marg>
re$t in the $ame place. Now, why, I pray you, ought they not
to have $aid, that its natural affection is to re$t immoveable, ra-
ther than to make natural unto it the motion ^{*} downwards, with
which motion it never did or $hall move? And as to the motion
<marg>*The word is, <I>all'
ingi&ugrave;,</I> which the
Latine ver$ion ren-
dreth <I>$ur$&ugrave;m,</I>
which is quite con-
trary to the Au-
thors $en$e.</marg>
by a right line, they mu$t grant us that Nature maketh u$e of it
to reduce the $mall parts of the Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and every
other integral Mundane body to their <I>Whole,</I> when any of them
by chance are $eparated, and $o tran$ported out of their proper
place; if al$o haply, $ome circular motion might not be found
to be more convenient to make this re$titution. In my judg-
ment, this primary po$ition an$wers much better, even according
to <I>Ari$totles</I> own method, to all the other con$equences, than
to attribute the $traight motion to be an intrin$ick and natural
<foot>principle</foot>
<p n=>33</p>
principle of the Elements. Which is manife$t, for that if I aske
the <I>Peripatetick,</I> if, being of opinion that C&oelig;le$tial bodies are
incorruptibe and eternal, he believeth that the Terre$tial Globe
is not $o, but corruptible and mortal, $o that there $hall come a
time, when the Sun and Moon and other Stars, continuing their
beings and operations, the Earth $hall not be found in the
World, but $hall with the re$t of the Elements be de$troyed
and annihilated, I am certain that he would an$wer me, no:
<marg><I>Right Motion
with more rea$on
attributed to the
parts, than to the
whole Elements.</I></marg>
therefore generation and corruption is in the parts and not in the
whole; and in the parts very $mall and $uperficial, which are,
as it were, incen$ible in compari$on of the whole ma$$e. And
becau$e <I>Ari$totle</I> deduceth generation and corruption from the
contrariety of $treight motions, let us remit $uch motions to the
parts, which onely change and decay, and to the whole Globe
and Sphere of the Elements, let us a$cribe either the circular mo-
tion, or a perpetual con$i$tance in its proper place: the only
affections apt for perpetuation, and maintaining of perfect order.
This which is $poken of the Earth, may be $aid with the $ame
rea$on of Fire, and of the greate$t part of the Air; to which
<marg><I>The Peripateticks
improperly a$$ign
tho$e motious to
the Elements for
Natural, with
which they never
were moved, and
tho$e for Preter-
natural with which
they alwayes are
moved.</I></marg>
Elements, the <I>Peripateticks</I> are forced to a$cribe for intrin$ical
and natural, a motion wherewith they were never yet moved,
nor never $hall be; and to call that motion preternatural to them,
wherewith, if they move at all, they do and ever $hall move.
This I $ay, becau$e they a$$ign to the Air aud Fire the motion
upwards, wherewith tho$e Elements were never moved, but
only $ome parts of them, and tho$e were $o moved onely in or-
der to the recovery of their perfect con$titution, when they were
out of their natural places; and on the contrary they call the
circular motion preternatural to them, though they are thereby
ince$$antly moved: forgeting, as it $eemeth, what <I>Ari$totle</I> oft in-
culcateth, that nothing violent can be permanent.</P>
<P>SIMPL. To all the$e we have very pertinent an$wers, which
<marg><I>Sen$ible experi-
ments to be prefer-
red to humane
Arguments.</I></marg>
I for this time omit, that we may come to the more particular
rea$ons, and $en$ible experiments, which ought in conclu$ion to
be oppo$ed, as <I>Ari$totle</I> $aitn well, to whatever humane rea$on
can pre$ent us with.</P>
<P>SAGR. What hath been $poken hitherto, $erves to clear up
unto us which of the two general di$cour$es carrieth with it mo$t
of probability, I mean that of <I>Ari$totle,</I> which would per$wade
us, that the $ublunary bodies are by nature generable, and corru-
ptible, <I>&amp;c.</I> and therefore mo$t different from the e$$ence of C&oelig;-
leftial bodies, which are impa$$ible, ingenerable, incorruptible,
<I>&amp;c.</I> drawn from the diver$ity of $imple motions; or el$e this of
<I>Salviatus,</I> who $uppo$ing the integral parts of the World to be
di$po$ed in a perfect con$titution, excludes by nece$$ary confe-
<foot>E quence</foot>
<p n=>34</p>
quence the right or $traight motion of $imple natural bodies, as
being of no u$e in nature, and e$teems the Earth it $elf al$o to
be one of the C&oelig;le$tial bodies adorn'd with all the prerogatives
that agree with them; which la$t di$cour$e is hitherto much
more likely, in my judgment, than that other. Therefore re-
$olve, <I>Simplicius,</I> to produce all the particular rea$ons, experi-
ments and ob$ervations, as well Natural as A$tronomical, that
may $erve to per$wade us that the Earth differeth from the C&oelig;-
le$tial bodies, is immoveable, and $ituated in the Centre of the
World, and what ever el$e excludes its moving like to the Planets,
as <I>Jupiter</I> or the <I>Moon, &amp;c.</I> And <I>Salviatus</I> will be plea$ed to
be $o civil as to an$wer to them one by one.</P>
<P>SIMPL. See here for a beginning, two mo$t convincing Argu-
ments to demon$trate the Earth to be mo$t different from the
C&oelig;le$tial bodies. Fir$t, the bodies that are generable, corru-
ptible, alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> are quite different from tho$e that are in-
generable, incorruptible, unalterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> But the Earth is ge-
nerable, corruptible, alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> and the C&oelig;le$tial bodies in-
generable, incorruptible, unalterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> Therefore the Earth
is quite different from the C&oelig;le$tial bodies.</P>
<P>SAGR. By your fir$t Argument you $pread the Table with the
$ame Viands, which but ju$t now with much adoe were voided.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Hold a little, Sir, and take the re$t along with you,
and then tell me if this be not different from what you had be-
fore. In the former, the <I>Minor</I> was proved <I>&agrave; priori,</I> &amp; now you $ee
it proved <I>&agrave; po$teriori:</I> Judg then if it be the $ame. I prove the
<I>Minor,</I> therefore (the <I>Major</I> being mo$t manife$t) by $en$ible ex-
perience, which $hews us that in the Earth there are made conti-
nual generations, corruptions, alterations, <I>&amp;c.</I> which neither our
$en$es, nor the traditions or memories of our Ance$tors, ever $aw
an in$tance of in Heaven; therefore Heaven is unalterable, <I>&amp;c.</I>
<marg><I>Heaven immuta-
ble, becau$e there
never was any mu-
tation $een in it.</I></marg>
and the Earth alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> and therefore different from Hea-
ven. I take my $econd Argument from a principal and e$$ential
accident, and it is this. That body which is by its nature ob-
<marg><I>Bodies naturally
lucid, are different
from tho$e which
are by nature ob-
$cure.</I></marg>
$cure and deprived of light, is divers from the luminous and $hi-
ning bodies; but the Earth is ob$cure and void of light, and the
C&oelig;le$tial bodies $plendid, and full of light; <I>Ergo, &amp;c.</I> An$wer
to the$e Arguments fir$t, that we may not heap up too many,
and then I will alledge others.</P>
<P>SALV. As to the fir$t, the $tre$$e whereof you lay upon ex-
perience, I de$ire that you would a little more di$tinctly produce
me the alteration which you $ee made in the Earth, and not in
Heaven; upon which you call the Earth alterable, and the Hea-
vens not $o.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I $ee in the Earth, plants and animals continually ge-
<foot>nerating</foot>
<p n=>35</p>
nerating and decaying; winds, rains, tempe$ts, $torms ari$ing; and
in a word, the a$pect of the Earth to be perpetually metamorpho-
$ing; none of which mutations are to be di$cern'd in the C&oelig;le$tial
bodies; the con$titution and figuration of which is mo$t punctu-
ally conformable to that they ever were time out of mind; without
the generation of any thing that is new, or corruption of any thing
that was old.</P>
<P>SALV. But if you content your $elf with the$e vi$ible, or to
$ay better, $een experiments, you mu$t con$equently account
<I>China</I> and <I>America</I> C&oelig;le$tial bodies, for doubtle$$e you never
beheld in them the$e alterations which you $ee here in <I>Italy,</I> and
that therefore according to your apprehen$ion they are inal-
terable.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Though I never did $ee the$e alterations $enfibly in
tho$e places, the relations of them are not to be que$tioned;
be$ides that, <I>cum eadem $it ratio totius, &amp; partium,</I> tho$e
Countreys being a part of the Earth, as well as ours, they
mu$t of nece$$ity be alterable as the$e are.</P>
<P>SALV. And why have you not, without being put to believe
other mens relations, examined and ob$erved tho$e alterations
with your own eyes?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Becau$e tho$e places, be$ides that they are not ex-
po$ed to our eyes, are $o remote, that our $ight cannot reach
to comprehend therein $uch like mutations.</P>
<P>SALV. See now, how you have unawares di$covered the falla-
cy of your Argument; for, if you $ay that the alterations that
are $een on the Earth neer at hand, cannot, by rea$on of the too
great di$tance, be $een in <I>America,</I> much le$$e can you $ee them
in the Moon, which is $o many hundred times more remote:
And if you believe the alterations in <I>Mexico</I> upon the report of
tho$e that come from thence, what intelligence have you from
the Moon, to a$$ure you that there is no $uch alterations in it?
Therefore, from your not $eeing any alterations in Heaven,
whereas, if there were any $uch, you could not $ee them by rea-
$on of their too great di$tance, and from your not having intel-
ligence thereof, in regard that it cannot be had, you ought not
to argue, that there are no $uch alterations; howbeit, from the
$eeing and ob$erving of them on Earth, you well argue that
therein $uch there are.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will $hew $o great mutations that have befaln on
the Earth; that if any $uch had happened in the Moon, they
might very well have been ob$erved here below. We find in
<marg><I>The Mediterr ani-
an Sea made by the
$eparation of</I> Abi-
la <I>and</I> Calpen.</marg>
very antient records, that heretofore at the Streights of <I>Gibraltar,</I>
the two great Mountains <I>Abila,</I> and <I>Calpen,</I> were continued to-
gether by certain other le$$e Mountains which there gave check
<foot>E 2 to</foot>
<p n=>36</p>
to the Ocean: but tho$e Hills, being by $ome cau$e or other $e-
parated, and a way being opened to the Sea to break in, it made
$uch an inundation, that it gave occa$ion to the calling of it $ince
the Mid-land Sea: the greatne$s whereof con$idered, and the di-
vers a$pect the $urface of the Water and Earth then made, had it
been beheld afar off, there is no doubt but $o great a change
might have been di$cerned by one that was then in the Moon;
as al$o to us inhabitants of the Earth, the like alterations would
be perceived in the Moon; but we find not in antiquity, that e-
ver there was $uch a thing $een; therefore we have no cau$e to
$ay, that any of the C&oelig;le$tial bodies are alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SALV. That $o great alterations have hapned in the Moon, I
dare not $ay, but for all that, I am not yet certain but that $uch
changes might occur; and becau$e $uch a mutation could onely
repre$ent unto us $ome kind of variation between the more clear,
and more ob$cure parts of the Moon, I know not whether we
have had on Earth ob$ervant Selenographers, who have for any
con$iderable number of years, in$tructed us with $o exact Seleno-
graphy, as that we $hould confidently conclude, that there hath
no $uch change hapned in the face of the Moon; of the figura-
tion of which I find no more particular de$cription, than the $ay-
ing of $ome, that it repre$ents an humane face; of others, that
it is like the muzzle of a lyon; and of others, that it is <I>Cain</I> with
a bundle of thorns on his back: therefore, to $ay Heaven is un-
alterable, becau$e that in the Moon, or other C&oelig;le$tial bodies, no
$uch alterations are $een, as di$cover them$elves on Earth, is a bad
illation, and concludeth nothing.</P>
<P>SAGR. And there is another odd kind of $cruple in this Argu-
ment of <I>Simplicius,</I> running in my mind, which I would gladly
have an$wered; therefore I demand of him, whether the Earth
before the Mediterranian inundation was generable and corrupti-
ble, or el$e began then $o to be?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It was doubtle$s generable and corruptible al$o be-
fore that time; but that was $o va$t a mutation, that it might
have been ob$erved as far as the Moon.</P>
<P>SAGR. Go to; if the Earth was generable and corruptible
before that Inundation, why may not the Moon be $o like-
wi$e without $uch a change? Or why $hould that be nece$$ary
in the Moon, which importeth nothing on Earth?</P>
<P>SALV. It is a $hrewd que$tion: But I am doubtfull that <I>Sim-
plicius</I> a little altereth the Text of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and the other <I>Peri-
patelicks,</I> who $ay, they hold the Heavens unalterable, for that
they $ee therein no one $tar generate or corrupt, which is proba-

them hath remain'd.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>37</p>
<P>SAGR. I verily believed otherwi$e, and conceited that <I>Sim-
plicius</I> di$$embled this expo$ition of the Text, that he might not
charge his Ma$ter and Con$ectators, with a notion more ab$urd
than the former. And what a folly it is to $ay the C&oelig;le$tial
part is unalterable, becau$e no $tars do generate or corrupt there-
in? What then? hath any $een a Terre$trial Globe corrupt, and
another regenerate in its place? And yet is it not on all hands
granted by Philo$ophers, that there are very few $tars in Heaven
le$s than the Earth, but very many that are much bigger? So
<marg><I>Its no le$s impo$$i-
ble for a $tar to
corrupt, than for
the whole Terre-
$trial Globe.</I></marg>
that for a $tar in Heaven to corrupt, would be no le$s than if the
whole Terre$trial Globe $hould be de$troy'd. Therefore, if for
the true proof of generation and corruption in the Univer$e, it be
nece$$ary that $o va$t bodies as a $tar, mu$t corrupt and regene-
rate, you may $atisfie your $elf and cea$e your opinion; for I
a$$ure you, that you $hall never $ee the Terre$trial Globe or any
other integral body of the World, to corrupt or decay $o, that
having been beheld by us for $o many years pa$t, they $hould $o
di$$olve, as not to leave any foot$teps of them.</P>
<P>SALV. But to give <I>Simplicius</I> yet fuller $atisfaction, and to
reclaim him, if po$$ible, from his error; I affirm, that we have in
<marg>Ari$totle <I>would
change his opinion,
did he $ee the no-
velties of our age.</I></marg>
our age new accidents and ob$ervations, and $uch, that I que$tion
not in the lea$t, but if <I>Ari$totle</I> were now alive, they would make
him change his opinion; which may be ea$ily collected from the
very manner of his di$cour$ing: For when he writeth that he e-
$teemeth the Heavens inalterable, &amp;c. becau$e no new thing was
$een to be begot therein, or any old to be di$$olved, he $eems im-
plicitely to hint unto us, that when he $hould $ee any $uch acci-
dent, he would hold the contrary; and confront, as indeed it is
meet, $en$ible experiments to natural rea$on: for had he not
made any reckoning of the $en$es, he would not then from the
not $eeing of any $en$ible mutation, have argued immutability.</P>
<P>SIMPL. <I>Ari$totle</I> deduceth his principal Argument <I>&agrave; priori,</I>
$hewing the nece$$ity of the inalterability of Heaven by natural,
manife$t and clear principles; and then $tabli$heth the $ame <I>&agrave; po-
$teriori,</I> by $en$e, and the traditions of the antients.</P>
<P>SALV. This you $peak of is the Method he hath ob$erved in
delivering his Doctrine, but I do not bethink it yet to be that
wherewith he invented it; for I do believe for certain, that he
fir$t procured by help of the $en$es, $uch experiments and ob$er-
vations as he could, to a$$ure him as much as it was po$$ible, of the
<marg><I>The certaixty of
the conclu$ion he<*>-
peth by are$olutive
method to $ind the
demonstration.</I></marg>
conclu$ion, and that he afterwards $ought out the means how to
demon$trate it: For this, the u$ual cour$e in demon$trative Scien-
ces, and the rea$on thereof is, becau$e when the conclu$ion is
true, by help of re$olutive Method, one may hit upon $ome pro-
po$ition before demon$trated, or come to $ome principle known
<foot><I>per</I></foot>
<p n=>38</p>
<I>per $e</I>; but if the conclu$ion be fal$e, a man may proceed <I>in in-
finitum,</I> and never meet with any truth already known; but ve-
ry oft he $hall meet with $ome impo$$ibility or manife$t ab$urdi-
<marg>Pythagoras <I>offered
an Hecatomb for
a Geometrical de-
mon$tration which

ty. Nor need you que$tion but that <I>Pythagoras</I> along time be-
fore he found the demon$tration for which he offered the Heca-
tomb, had been certain, that the $quare of the $ide $ubtending
the right angle in a rectangle triangle, was equal to the $quare of
the other two $ides: and the certainty of the conclu$ion condu-
ced not a little to the inve$tigating of the demon$tration, un-
der$tanding me alwayes to mean in demon$trative Sciences. But
what ever was the method of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and whether his arguing <I>&agrave;
priori</I> preceded $en$e <I>&agrave; po$teriori,</I> or the contrary; it $ufficeth that
the $ame <I>Ari$totle</I> preferreth (as hath been oft $aid) $en$ible ex-
periments before all di$cour$es; be$ides, as to the Arugments <I>&agrave;
priori</I> their force hath been already examined. Now returning
to my purpo$ed matter, I $ay, that the things in our times di$-
covered in the Heavens, are, and have been $uch, that they may
give ab$olute $atisfaction to all Philo$ophers; fora$much as in
the particular bodies, and in the univer$al expan$ion of Heaven,
there have been, and are continually, $een ju$t $uch accidents as
we call generations and corruptions, being that excellent A-
$tronomers have ob$erved many Comets generated and di$$olved
in parts higher than the Lunar Orb, be$ides the two new Stars,
<marg><I>New $tars di$co-
vered in Heaven.</I></marg>
<I>Anuo</I> 1572, and <I>Anno</I> 1604, without contradiction much higher
than all the Planets; and in the face of the Sun it $elf, by help
<marg><I>Spots generate and
di$$olve in the face
of the Sun.</I></marg>
of the <I>Tele$cope,</I> certain den$e and ob$cure $ub$tances, in $em-
blance very like to the foggs about the Earth, are $een to be
produced and di$$olved; and many of the$e are $o va$t, that
they far exceed not only the Mediterranian Streight, but all
<marg><I>Solar spots are
bigger than all</I> A-
$ia <I>and</I> Affrick.</marg>
<I>Affrica</I> and <I>A$ia</I> al$o. Now if <I>Ari$totle</I> had $een the$e things,
what think you he would have $aid, and done <I>Simplicius?</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. I know not what <I>Ari$totle</I> would have done or $aid,
that was the great Ma$ter of all the Sciences, but yet I know in
part, what his Sectators do and $ay, and ought to do and $ay,
unle$$e they would deprive them$elves of their guide, leader, and
Prince in Philo$ophy. As to the Comets, are not tho$e Modern
A$tronomers, who would make them C&oelig;le$tial, convinced by
<marg>* <I>A$tronomers con-
futed by</I> Anti-Ty-
cho.</marg>
the ^{*}<I>Anti-Tycho,</I> yea, and overcome with their own weapons, I
mean by way of Paralaxes and Calculations, every way tryed,
concluding at the la$t in favour of <I>Aristotle,</I> that they are all
Elementary? And this being overthrown, which was as it were
their foundation, have the$e Novelli$ts any thing more where-
with to maintain their a$$ertion?</P>
<P>SALV. Hold a little, good <I>Simplicius,</I> this modern Author,
what $aith he to the new Stars, <I>Anno</I> 1572, and 1604, and to
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>39</p>
the Solar $pots? for as to the Comets, I for my own particular
little care to make them generated under or above the Moon;
nor did I ever put much $tre$$e on the loquacity of <I>Tycho</I>; nor
am I hard to believe that their matter is Elementary, and that
they may elevate ($ublimate) them$elves at their plea$ure, with-
out meeting with any ob$tacle from the impenetrability of the
<I>Peripatetick</I> Heaven, which I hold to be far more thin, yielding,
and $ubtil than our Air; and as to the calculations of the Pa-
rallaxes, fir$t, the uncertainty whether Comets are $ubject to
$uch accidents, and next, the incon$tancy of the ob$ervations,
upon which the computations are made, make me equally $u$-
pect both tho$e opinions: and the rather, for that I $ee him
<marg>Anti-Tycho <I>wre-
$teth A$tronomical
ob$ervations to his
own parpo$e.</I></marg>
you call <I>Anti-Tycho,</I> $ometimes $tretch to his purpo$e, or el$e
reject tho$e ob$ervations which interfere with his de$ign.</P>
<P>SIMPL. As to the new Stars, <I>Anti-Tycho</I> extricates him$elf
finely in three or four words; $aying, That tho$e mo-
dern new Stars are no certain parts of the C&oelig;le$tial bodies, and
that the adver$aries, if they will prove alteration and genera-
tion in tho$e $uperior bodies, mu$t $hew $ome mutations that
have been made in the Stars de$cribed $o many ages pa$t, of
which there is no doubt but that they be C&oelig;le$tial bodies,
which they can never be able to do: Next, as to tho$e mat-
ters which $ome affirm, to generate and di$$ipate in the face of
the Sun, he makes no mention thereof; wherefore I conclude,
that he believed them fictious, or the illu$ions of the Tube, or
at mo$t, $ome petty effecs cau$ed by the Air, and in brief, any
thing rather than matters C&oelig;le$tial.</P>
<P>SALV. But you, <I>Simplicius,</I> what an$wer could you give to
the oppo$ition of the$e importunate $pots which are $tarted up
to di$turb the Heavens, and more than that, the <I>Peripatetick</I>
Philo$ophy? It cannot be but that you, who are $o re$olute a
Champion of it, have found $ome reply or $olution for the
$ame, of which you ought not to deprive us.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have heard $undry opinions about this particular.
One $aith: &ldquo;They are Stars which in their proper Orbs, like as
<marg><I>Sundry opinions
touching the Solar
$pots.</I></marg>
<I>Venus</I> and <I>Mervury,</I> revolve about the Sun, and in pa$$ing un-
der it, repre$ent them$elves to us ob$cure; and for that they
are many, they oft happen to aggregate their parts together,
and afterwards $eperate again. Others believe them to be
aerial impre$$ions; others, the illu$ions of the chry$tals; and o-
thers, other things: But I incline to think, yea am verily per-
$waded, That they are an aggregate of many $everal opacous
bodies, as it were ca$ually concurrent among them$elves. And
therefore we often $ee, that in one of tho$e $pots one may
number ten or more $uch $mall bodies, which are of irregu-
<foot>lar</foot>
<p n=>40</p>
lar figures, and $eem to us like flakes of $now, or flocks of
wooll, or moaths flying: they vary $ite among$t them$elves,
and one while $ever, another while meet, and mo$t of all be-
neath the Sun, about which, as about their Centre, they con-
tinually move. But yet, mu$t we not therefore grant, that
they are generated or di$$olved, but that at $ometimes they are
hid behind the body of the Sun, and at other times, though
remote from it, yet are they not $een for the vicinity of the
immea$urable light of the Sun; in regard that in the eccentrick
Orb of the Sun, there is con$tituted, as it were, an Onion, com-
po$ed of many folds one within another, each of which, being

doth not $uffice; there wants not more elevated wits, which will

makes his rea$on more probable and plau$ible; but in Natural
Sciences, the conclu$ions of which are true and nece$$ary, and
wherewith the judgment of men hath nothing to do, one is to
be more cautious how he goeth about to maintain any thing that
is fal$e; for a man but of an ordinary wit, if it be his good for-
tune to be of the right $ide, may lay a thou$and <I>Demo$thenes</I> and
a thou$and <I>Ari$totles</I> at his feet. Therefore reject tho$e hopes
and conceits, wherewith you flatter your $elf, that there can be
any men $o much more learned, read, and ver$ed in Authors,
than we, that in de$pite of nature, they $hould be able to
make that become true, which is fal$e. And $eeing that of all
the opinions that have been hitherto alledged touching the e$-
$ence of the$e Solar $pots, this in$tanced in by you, is in your
judgment the true$t, it followeth (if this be $o) that all the re$t
are fal$e; and to deliver you from this al$o, which doubtle$$e is a
mo$t fal$e <I>Chim&oelig;ra,</I> over-pa$$ing infinite other improbabilities
that are therein, I $hall propo$e again$t it onely two experiments;
<marg><I>An Argument
that nece$$arily
proveth the Solar
$pots to generate
and di$$olwe.</I></marg>
one is, that many of tho$e $pots are $een to ari$e in the mid$t of
the Solar ring, and many likewi$e to di$$olve and vani$h at a great
di$tance from the circumference of the Sun; a nece$$ary Argu-
<foot>ment</foot>
<p n=>41</p>
ment that they generate and di$$olve; for if without generating
or corrrupting, they $hould appear there by onely local motion,
they would all be $een to enter, and pa$s out by the extreme cir-

cumference. The other ob$ervation to $uch as are not $ituate in
the lowe$t degree of ignorance in Per$pective, by the mutation
of the appearing figures, and by the apparent mutations of the
velocity of motion is nece$$arily concluding, that the $pots are
contiguous to the body of the Sun, and that touching its $uperfi-
cies, they move either with it or upon it, and that they in no wi$e
move in circles remote from the $ame. The motion proves
<marg><I>The motion of the

it, which towards the circumference of the Solar Circle,
appeareth very $low, and towards the mid$t, more $wift; the fi-

appear exceeding narrow in compari$on of that which they $eem
to be in the parts nearer the middle; and this becau$e in the
mid$t they are $een in their full lu$ter, and as they truly be; and
towards the circumference by rea$on of the convexity of the glo-
bous $uperficies, they $eem more compre$$'d: And both the$e
diminutions of figure and motion, to $uch as know how to ob$erve
and calculate them exactly, preci$ely an$wer to that which $hould
appear, the $pots being contiguous to the Sun, and differ irrecon-
cileably from a motion in circles remote, though but for $mal

mon$trated by our ^{*} Friend, in his Letters about the Solar $pots,
to <I>Marcus Vel$erus.</I> It may be gathered from the $ame muta-
tion of figure, that none of them are $tars, or other bodies of
$pherical figure; for that among$t all figures the $phere never
appeareth compre$$ed, nor can ever be repre$ented but onely per-
fectly round; and thus in ca$e any particular $pot were a round
body, as all the $tars are held to be, the $aid roundne$s would as
well appear in the mid$t of the Solar ring, as when the $pot is near
the extreme: whereas, its $o great compre$$ion, and $hewing its
$elf $o $mall towards the extreme, and contrariwi$e, $patious and
large towards the middle, a$$ureth us, that the$e $pots are flat
<marg><I>The Solar spots

plates of $mall thickne$s or depth, in compari$on of their length
and breadth. La$tly, whereas you $ay that the $pots after their
determinate periods are ob$erved to return to their former a$pect,
believe it not, <I>Simplicius,</I> for he that told you $o, will deceive
you; and that I $peak the truth, you may ob$erve them to be hid
in the face of the Sun far from the circumference; nor hath your
Ob$ervator told you a word of that compre$$ion, which nece$$a-
rily argueth them to be contiguous to the Sun. That which he
tells you of the return of the $aid $pots, is nothing el$e but what
is read in the forementioned Letters, namely, that $ome of them
may $ometimes $o happen that are of $o long a duration, that
<foot>F they</foot>
<p n=>42</p>
they cannot be di$$ipated by one $ole conver$ion about the Sun,
which is accompli$hed in le$s than a moneth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I, for my part, have not made either $o long, or $o
exact ob$ervations, as to enable me to boa$t my $elf Ma$ter of the
<I>Quod ect</I> of this matter: but I will more accurately con$ider the
$ame, and make tryal my $elf for my own $atisfaction, whether I
can reconcile that which experience $hews us, with that which
<I>Ari$totle</I> teacheth us; for it's a certain Maxim, that two Truths
cannot be contrary to one another.</P>

with the $olider Doctrines of <I>Ari$totle,</I> you will find no great dif-

the $en$es can better repre$ent the $ame, may philo$ophate upon

are brought thirty or forty times nearer to the Heavens, than ever

we may di$cour$e of the Heavens and Sun, with more certainty
than <I>Ari$tolte.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. I $ee into the heart of <I>Simplicius,</I> and know that he is
much moved at the $trength of the$e $o convincing Arguments;
but on the other $ide, when he con$idereth the great authority
which <I>Ari$totle</I> hath won with all men, and remembreth the great

we repair for the deci$ion of our controver$ies, if <I>Ari$totle</I> were
removed from the chair? What other Author $hould we follow
in the Schools, Academies and Studies? What Philo$opher hath
writ all the parts of Natural Philo$ophy, and that $o methodically
without omitting $o much as one $ingle conclu$ion? Shall we then
overthrow that Fabrick under which $o many pa$$engers find

without expo$ing them$elves to the injuries of the air, with the
onely turning over of a few leaves, one may learn all the $e-

that Gentleman who with great expence of time and trea$ure,
and the help of many hundred arti$ts, erects a very $umptu-

of the bad foundation; but being extremely unwilling to $ee

they will rather, without ever turning the points of their pens
again$t them, by their $ilence onely render them the object of
univer$al $corn and contempt. It is a fond conceit for any one
to think to introduce new Philo$ophy, by reproving this or that
Author: it will be fir$t nece$$ary to new-mold the brains of
men, and make them apt to di$tingui$h truth from fal$hood. A
thing which onely God can do. But from one di$cour$e to another
whither are we $tray'd? your memory mu$t help to guide me into
the way again.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I remember very well where we left. We were
upon the an$wer of <I>Anti-Tycho,</I> to the objections again$t the
immutability of the Heavens, among which you in$erted this
of the Solar fpots, not $poke of by him; and I believe you
intended to examine his an$wer to the in$tance of the New
Stars.</P>
<foot>F 2 SALV.</foot>
<p n=>44</p>
<P>SALV. Now I remember the re$t, and to proceed, Methinks
there are $ome things in the an$wer of <I>Anti-Tycho,</I> worthy of
reprehen$ion. And fir$t, if the two New Stars, which he can do
no le$s than place in the uppermo$t parts of the Heavens, and
which were of a long duration, but finally vani$hed, give him no
ob$truction in maintaining the inalterability of Heaven, in that
they were not certain parts thereof, nor mutations made in the
antient Stars, why doth he $et him$elf $o vigorou$ly and earne$tly
again$t the Comets, to bani$h them by all ways from the C&oelig;le-
$tial Regions? Was it not enough that he could $ay of them
the $ame which he $poke of the New $tars? to wit, that in re-
gard they were no certain parts of Heaven, nor mutations made
in any of the Stars, they could no wi$e prejudice either Heaven,
or the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle</I>? Secondly, I am not very well $atis-
fied of his meaning; when he $aith that the alterations that $hould
be granted to be made in the Stars, would be de$tructive to the
prerogative of Heaven; namely, its incorruptibility, <I>&amp;c.</I> and

<marg>* Ex tra Stellas.</marg>
the $ame alterations $hould be made ^{*} without the Stars in the re$t
of the C&oelig;le$tial expan$ion. Doth he think that Heaven is no
C&oelig;le$tial $ub$tance? I, for my part, did believe that the Stars
were called C&oelig;le$tial bodies, by rea$on that they were in Hea-
ven, or for that they were made of the $ub$tance of Heaven;
and yet I thought that Heaven was more C&oelig;le$tial than they; in
like $ort, as nothing can be $aid to be more Terre$trial, or more
fiery than the Earth or Fire them$elves. And again, in that he ne-
ver made any mention of the Solar $pots, which have been evi-
dently demon$trated to be produced, and di$$olved, and to be
neer the Sun, and to turn either with, or about the $ame, I have
rea$on to think that this Author probably did write more for others
plea$ure, than for his own $atisfaction; and this I affirm, fora$-
much as he having $hewn him$elf to be skilful in the Mathema-
ticks, it is impo$$ible but that he $hould have been convinced by
Demon$trations, that tho$e $ub$tances are of nece$$ity contigu-
ous with the body of the Sun, and are $o great generations and
corruptions, that none comparable to them, ever happen in the
Earth: And if $uch, $o many, and $o frequent be made in the
very Globe of the Sun, which may with rea$on be held one of the
noble$t parts of Heaven, what $hould make us think that others
may not happen in the other Orbs?</P>

be there, $ave onely in a very general acceptation, namely, things
that adorn it by operating, moving and living; and perhaps in a way

<P>SALV. It $hall be as you would have it. And to begin with
things more general, I believe that the Lunar Globe is far diffe-
rent from the Terre$trial, though in $ome things they agree. I will
recount fir$t their re$emblances, and next their differences. The
<marg><I>The</I> Fir$t <I>re$em-
blance between the
Moon and Earth;
which is that of
figure; is proved by
the manner of be-
ing illuminated by
the Sun.</I></marg>
Moon is manife$tly like to the Earth in figure, which undoubtedly
is $pherical, as may be nece$$arily concluded from the a$pect of its
$urface, which is perfectly Orbicular, and the manner of its re-
ceiving the light of the Sun, from which, if its $urface were flat,
it would come to be all in one and the $ame time illuminated, and
likewi$e again in another in$tant of time ob$cured, and not tho$e
parts fir$t, which are $ituate towards the Sun, and the re$t $ucce$-
$ively, $o that in its oppo$ition, and not till then, its whole
apparent circumference is enlightned; which would happen quite
contrary, if the vi$ible $urface were concave; namely, the illu-
<marg><I>The</I> Second <I>con-
formity is the

cous as the Earth.</I></marg>
mination would begin from the parts oppo$ite or aver$e to the Sun.
Secondly $he is as the Earth, in her $elf ob$cure and opacous, by
which opacity it is enabled to receive, and reflect the light of the
<foot><*></foot>
<p n=>49</p>
Sun; which were it not $o, it could not do. Thirdly, I hold its
<marg><I>Thirdly, The mat-
ter of the Moon is
den$e and mo ita-
nous as the Earth.</I></marg>
matter to be mo$t den$e and $olid as the Earth is, which I clearly
argue from the unevenne$s of its $uperficies in mo$t places, by means
of the many eminencies and cavities di$covered therein by help of
the <I>$ele$cope</I>: of which eminencies there are many all over it, di-
rectly re$embling our mo$t $harp and craggy mountains, of which
you $hall there perceive $ome extend and run in ledges of an hun-
dred miles long; others are contracted into rounder forms; and
there are al$o many craggy, $olitary, $teep and cliffy rocks. But
that of which there are frequente$t appearances, are certain Banks
(I u$e this word, becau$e I cannot thing of another that better ex-
pre$$eth them) pretty high rai$ed, which environ and inclo$e fields
of $everal bigne$$es, and form $undry figures, but for the mo$t part
circular; many of which have in the mid$t a mount rai$ed pretty
high, and $ome few are repleni$hed with a matter $omewhat ob-
$cure, to wit, like to the great $pots di$cerned by the bare eye, and
the$e are of the greate$t magnitude; the number moreover of tho$e
that are le$$er and le$$er is very great, and yet almo$t all circular.
<marg><I>Fourthly, The
Moon is di$tin-
gui$hed into two
different parts for
clarity and ob$cu-
rity, as the Terre-
strial Globe into
Sea and Land.</I></marg>
Fourthly, like as the $urface of our Globe is di$tingui$hed into two
principal parts, namely, into the Terre$trial and Aquatick: $o in
the Lunar $urface we di$cern a great di$tinction of $ome great fields
more re$plendant, and $ome le$s: who$e a$pect makes me believe,
that that of the Earth would $eem very like it, beheld by any one
from the Moon, or any other the like di$tance, to be illuminated
<marg><I>The $urface of the
Sea would $hew at
a di$tance more ob-
$oure than that of
the Earth.</I></marg>
by the Sun: and the $urface of the $ea would appear more ob-
$cure, and that of the Earth more bright. Fifthly, like as we from
the Earth behold the Moon, one while all illuminated, another
<marg><I>Fiftly, Muta-
tion of $igures in
the Earth, like to

and made with the

while half; $ometimes more, $ometimes le$s; $ometimes horned,
$ometimes wholly invi$ibly; namely, when its ju$t under the Sun
beams; $o that the parts which look towards the Earth are dark:
Thus in every re$pect, one $tanding in the Moon would $ee the
illumination of the Earths $urface by the Sun, with the $ame
periods to an hair, and under the $ame changes of figures.
Sixtly, -----</P>
<P>SAGR. Stay a little, <I>Salviatus</I>; That the illumination of
the Earth, as to the $everal figures, would repre$ent it $elf to a per$on
placed in the Moon, like in all things to that which we di$cover in
the Moon, I under$tand very well, but yet I cannot conceive how
it $hall appear to be done in the $ame period; $eeing that that
which the Suns illumination doth in the Lunar $uperficies in a
month, it doth in the Terre$trial in twenty four hours.</P>
<P>SALV. Its true, the effect of the Sun about the illuminating
the$e two bodies, and repleni$hing with its $plendor their whole
$urfaces, is di$patch'd in the Earth in a Natural day, and in the
Moon in a Month; but the variation of the figures in which the
<foot>G illumi-</foot>
<p n=>50</p>
illuminated parts of the Terre$trial $uperficies appear beheld from
the Moon, depends not on this alone, but on the divers a$pects
which the Moon is $till changing with the Sun; $o that, if for in-
$tance, the Moon punctually followed the motion of the Sun, and
$tood, for example, always in a direct line between it and the
Earth, in that a$pect which we call Conjunction, it looking always
to the $ame Hemi$phere of the Earth which the Sun looks unto,
$he would behold the $ame all light: as on the contrary, if it $hould
always $tay in Oppo$ition to the Sun, it would never behold the
Earth, of which the dark part would be continually turn'd towards
the Moon, and therefore invi$ible. But when the Moon is in
Quadrature of the Sun, that half of the Terre$trial Hemi$phere ex-
po$ed to the $ight of the Moon which is towards the Sun, is lumi-
nous; and the other towards the contrary is ob$cure: and there-
fore the illuminated part of the Earth would repre$ent it $elf to the
Moon in a $emi-circular figure.</P>
<P>SAGR. I clearly perceive all this, and under$tand very well,
that the Moon departing from its Oppo$ition to the Sun, where it
$aw no part of the illumination of the Terre$trial $uperficies, and
approaching day by day nearer the Sun, $he begins by little and
little to di$cover $ome part of the face of the illuminated Earth;
and that which appeareth of it $hall re$emble a thin $ickle, in regard
the figure of the Earth is round: and the Moon thus acquiring by
its motion day by day greater proximity to the Sun, $ucce$$ively
di$covers more and more of the Terre$trial Hemi$phere enlightned,
$o that at the Quadrature there is ju$t half of it vi$ible, in$omuch
that we may $ee the other part of her: continuing next to proceed
towards the Conjunction, it $ucce$$ively di$covers more and more
of its $urface to be illuminated, and in fine, at the time of Conjun-
ction $eeth the whole Hemi$phere enlightned. And in $hort, I
very well conceive, that what befalls the Inhabitants of the Earth,
in beholding the changes of the Moon, would happen to him that
from the Moon $hould ob$erve the Earth; but in a contrary order,
namely, that when the Moon is to us at her full, and in Oppo$ition
to the Sun, then the Earth would be in Conjunction with the Sun,
and wholly ob$cure and invi$ible; on the contrary, that po$ition
which is to us a Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, and for
that cau$e a <I>M</I>oon $ilent and un$een, would be there an Oppo$ition
of the Earth to the Sun, and, to $o $peak, <I>Full Earth,</I> to wit, all
enlightned. And la$tly, look what part of the Lunar $urface ap-
pears to us from time to time illuminated, $o much of the Earth
in the $ame time $hall you behold from the Moon to be ob$cured:
and look how much of the Moon is to us deprived of light, $o much
of the Earth is to the Moon illuminated. In one thing yet the$e
mutual operations in my judgment $eem to differ, and it is, that it
<foot>being</foot>
<p n=>51</p>
being $uppo$ed, and not granted, that $ome one being placed in the
Moon to ob$erve the Earth, he would every day $ee the whole
Terre$trial $uperficies, by means of the Moons going about the
Earth in twenty four or twenty five hours; but we never $ee but
half of the Moon, $ince it revolves not in it $elf, as it mu$t do to
be $een in every part of it.</P>
<P>SALV. So that this, befals not contrarily, namely, that her re-
volving in her $elf, is the cau$e that we $ee not the other half of
her, for $o it would be nece$$ary it $hould be, if $he had the Epicy-
cle. But what other difference have you behind, to exchange for
this which you have named?</P>
<P>SAGR. Let me $ee; Well for the pre$ent I cannot think of
any other.</P>
<P>SALV. And what if the Earth (as you have well noted) $eeth
<marg><I>All the Earth

no more than half the Moon, whereas from the Moon one may $ee
all the Earth; and on the contrary, all the Earth $eeth the Moon, and
but onely half of it $eeth the Earth? For the inhabitants, to $o $peak,
of the $uperior Hemi$phere of the Moon, which is to us invi$ible,
are deprived of the $ight of the Earth: and the$e haply are the
<I>Anticthones.</I> But here I remember a particular accident, newly
ob$erved by our <I>Academian,</I> in the Moon, from whch are gathered
<marg><I>From the Earth
we $ee more than
half the Lunar
Globe.</I></marg>
two nece$$ary con$equences; one is, that we $ee $omewhat more
than half of the Moon; and the other is, that the motion of the
Moon hath exact concentricity with the Earth: and thus he finds
the <I>Ph&oelig;nomenon</I> and ob$ervation. When the Moon hath a cor-
re$pondence and natural $ympathy with the Earth, towards which
it hath its a$pect in $uch a determinate part, it is nece$$ary that the
right line which conjoyns their centers, do pa$$e ever by the $ame
point of the Moons $uperficies; $o that, who $o $hall from the cen-
ter of the Earth behold the $ame, $hall alwayes $ee the $ame
<I>Di$cus</I> or Face of the Moon punctually determined by one and
the $ame circumference; But if a man be placed upon the Terre-
$trial $urface, the ray which from his eye pa$$eth to the centre of the
Lunar Globe, will not pa$s by the $ame point of its $uperficies, by
which the line pa$$eth that is drawn from the centre of the Earth
to that of the Moon, $ave onely when it is vertical to him: but
the Moon being placed in the Ea$t, or in the We$t, the point of
incidence of the vi$ual ray, is higher than that of the line which
conjoyns the centres; and therefore the ob$erver may di$cern
$ome part of the Lunar Hemi$phere towards the upper circumfe-
rence, and alike part of the other is invi$ible: they are di$cerna-
ble and undi$cernable, in re$pect of the Hemi$phere beheld from
the true centre of the Earth: and becau$e the part of the Moons
circumference, which is $uperiour in its ri$ing, is nethermo$t in its
$etting; therefore the difference of the $aid $uperiour and inferi-
<foot>G 2 our</foot>
<p n=>52</p>
our parts mu$t needs be very ob$ervable; certain $pots and other
notable things in tho$e parts, being one while di$cernable, and
another while not. A like variation may al$o be ob$erved towards
the North and South extremities of the $ame <I>Di$cus</I> (or Surface)
according as the Moons po$ition is in one or the other Section of
its Dragon; For, if it be North, $ome of its parts towards the

<marg><I>Two $pots in the
Moon, by which it
is perceived that
$he hath respect to
the centre of the
Earth in her mo-
tion.</I></marg>
ces are really true, is verified by the <I>Tele$cope,</I> for there be in
the Moon two remarkable $pots, one of which, when the Moon
is in the meridian, is $ituate to the Northwe$t, and the other is
almo$t diametrically oppo$ite unto it; and the fir$t of the$e is vi-
$ible even without the <I>Tele$cope</I>; but the other is not. That to-
wards the Northwe$t is a rea$onable great $pot of oval figure, $e-
parated from the other great ones; the oppo$ite one is le$$e, and
al$o $evered from the bigge$t, and $ituate in a very cleer field; in
both the$e we may manife$tly di$cern the fore$aid variations, and
$ee them one after another; now neer the edge or limb of the
Lunar <I>Di$cus,</I> and anon remote, with $o great difference that
the di$tance betwixt the Northwe$t and the circumference of the
<I>Di$cus</I> is more than twice as great at one time, as at the other;
and as to the $econd $pot (becau$e it is neerer to the circumfe-
rence) $uch mutation importeth more, than twice $o much in the
former. Hence its manife$t, that the Moon, as if it were drawn
by a magnetick vertue, con$tantly beholds the Terre$trial Globe
with one and the $ame a$pect, never deviating from the $ame.</P>

<P>SALV. If this $ucceed according to the progre$$e of other great

arrive to the $ight of things, to us at pre$ent not to be imagined.

But returning to our fir$t di$cour$e, I $ay for the $ixth re$emblance
betwixt the Moon and Earth, that as the Moon for a great part
of time, $upplies the want of the Suns light, and makes the
nights, by the reflection of its own, rea$onable clear; $o the
Earth, in recompence, affordeth it when it $tands in mo$t need,
by reflecting the Solar rayes, a very cleer illumination, and $o
much, in my opinion, greater than that which cometh from her to
us, by how much the $uperficies of the Earth is greater than that
of the Moon.</P>
<P>SAGR. Hold there, <I>Salviatus</I> hold there, and permit me the
plea$ure of relating to you, how at this fir$t hint I have penetrated
the cau$e of an accident, which I have a thou$and times thought
<marg><I>Light reflected

to the Moon.</I></marg>
upon, but could never find out. You would $ay, that the imper-
fect light which is $een in the Moon, e$pecially when it is horned,
<foot>comes</foot>
<p n=>53</p>
comes from the reflection of the light of the Sun on the Superfi-
cies of the Earth and Sea; and that light is more clear, by how
much the horns are le$$e, for then the luminous part of the Earth,
beheld by the Moon, is greater, according to that which was
a little before proved; to wit, that the luminous part of the Earth,
expo$ed to the Moon, is alway as great as the ob$cure part of
the Moon, that is vi$ible to the Earth; whereupon, at $uch time
as the Moon is $harp-forked, and con$equently its tenebrous part
great, great al$o is the illuminated part of the Earth beheld from
the Moon, and its reflection of light $o much the more potent.</P>
<P>SALV. This is exactly the $ame with what I was about to $ay.
In a word, it is a great plea$ure to $peak with per$ons judicious
and apprehen$ive, and the rather to me, for that while$t others
conver$e and di$cour$e touching Axiomatical truths, I have ma-
ny times creeping into my brain $uch arduous Paradoxes, that
though I have a thou$and times rehear$ed this which you at the ve-
ry fir$t, have of your $elf apprehended, yet could I never beat
it into mens brains.</P>
<P>SIMPL. If you mean by your not being able to per$wade them
to it, that you could not make them under$tand the $ame, I
much wonder thereat, and am very confident that if they did
not under$tand it by your demon$tration (your way of expre$$ion,
being, in my judgment, very plain) they would very hardly have
apprehended it upon the explication of any other man; but if
you mean you have not per$waded them, $o as to make them be-
lieve it, I wonder not, in the lea$t, at this; for I confe$$e my
$elf to be one of tho$e who under$tand your di$cour$es, but
am not $atisfied therewith; for there are in this, and $ome of
the other $ix congruities, or re$emblances, many difficulties,
which I $hall in$tance in, when you have gone through them
all.</P>
<P>SALV. The de$ire I have to find out any truth, in the acqui$t
whereof the objections of intelligent per$ons ($uch as your $elf)
may much a$$i$t me, will cau$e me to be very brief in di$patching
that which remains. For a $eventh conformity, take their reci-
<marg><I>Seventhly, The

procal re$pon$ion as well to injuries, as favours; whereby the
Moon, which very often in the height of its illumination, by the
interpo$ure of the Earth betwixt it and the Sun, is deprived of
light, and eclip$ed, doth by way of revenge; in like manner, in-
te<*>po$e it $elf between the Earth and the Sun, and with its $hadow
ob$cureth the Earth; and although the revenge be not an$wer-
able to the injury, for that the Moon often continueth, and
that for a rea$onable long time, wholly immer$ed in the Earths
$hadow, but never was the Earth wholly, nor for any long time,
eclip$ed by the Moon; yet, neverthele$$e, having re$pect to the
<foot>$mal-</foot>
<p n=>54</p>
$malne$$e of the body of this, in compari$on to the magnitude
of the other, it cannot be denied but that the <I>will</I> and as it
were <I>valour</I> of this, is very great. Thus much for their con-
gruities or re$emblances. It $hould next follow that we di$cour$e
touching their di$parity; but becau$e <I>Simplicius</I> will favour us
with his objections again$t the former, its nece$$ary that we hear
and examine them, before we proceed any farther.</P>
<P>SAGR. And the rather, becau$e it is to be $uppo$ed that
<I>Simplicius</I> will not any wayes oppo$e the di$parities, and incon-
gruities betwixt the Earth and Moon, $ince that he accounts their
$ub$tances extremely different.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Among$t the re$emblances by you recited, in the pa-
rallel you make betwixt the Earth and Moon, I find that I can
admit none confidently $ave onely the fir$t, and two others; I
grant the fir$t, namely, the $pherical figure; howbeit, even in
this there is $ome kind of difference, for that I hold that of the
Moon to be very $mooth and even, as a looking-gla$$e, where-
as, we find and feel this of the Earth to be extraordinary montu-
ous and rugged; but this belonging to the inequality of $uperfi-
cies, it $hall be anon con$idered, in another of tho$e Re$emblan-
ces by you alledged; I $hall therefore re$erve what I have to $ay
thereof, till I come to the con$ideration of that. Of what you
affirm next, that the Moon $eemeth, as you $ay in your $econd
Re$emblance, opacous and ob$cure in its $elf, like the Earth; I
admit not any more than the fir$t attribute of opacity, of which
the Eclip$es of the Sun a$$ure me. For were the Moon tran$pa-
rent, the air in the total ob$curation of the Sun, would not be-
come $o duski$h, as at $uch a time it is, but by means of the
tran$parency of the body of the Moon, a refracted light would
pa$$e through it, as we $ee it doth through the thicke$t clouds. But
as to the ob$curity, I believe not that the Moon is wholly depri-
ved of light, as the Earth; nay, that clarity which is $een in the
remainder of its <I>Di$cus,</I> over and above the $mall cre$cent en-
lightened by the Sun, I repute to be its proper and natural light,
<marg><I>The $econd clarity
of the Moon e-
$teemed to be its
native light.</I></marg>
and not a reflection of the Earth, which I e$teem unable, by
rea$on of its a$perity (craggine$$e) and ob$curity, to reflect the
raies of the Sun. In the third Parallel I a$$ent unto you in one
<marg><I>The Earth unable
to reflect the Suns
raies.</I></marg>
part, and di$$ent in another: I agree in judging the body of the
Moon to be mo$t $olid and hard, like the Earth, yea much more;
<marg><I>The $ub$tance of
the Heavens impe-
netrable, accord-
ing to</I> Ari$totle.</marg>
for if from <I>Ari$totle</I> we receive that the Heavens are impenetrable,
and the Stars the mo$t den$e parts of Heaven, it mu$t nece$$arily
follow, that they are mo$t $olid and mo$t impenetrable.</P>
<P>SAGR. What excellent matter would the Heavens afford us for
to make Pallaces of, if we could procure a $ub$tance $o hard and $o
tran$parent?</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>55</p>
<P>SALV. Rather how improper, for being by its tran$parence,
wholly invi$ible, a man would not be able without $tumbling at
the thre$holds, and breaking his head again$t the Walls, to pa$s
from room to room.</P>
<P>SAGR. This danger would not befall him, if it be true, as $ome
<marg><I>The $ubstance of

<I>Peripateticks</I> $ay, that it is intangible: and if one cannot
touch it, much le$s can it hurt him.</P>
<P>SALV. This would not $erve the turn, for though the matter
of the Heavens cannot be toucht, as wanting tangible qualities:
yet may it ea$ily touch the elementary bodies; and to offend us
it is as $ufficient that it $trike us, nay wor$e, than if we $hould
$trike it. But let us leave the$e <I>Pallaces,</I> or, to $ay better, the$e
<I>Ca$tles</I> in the air, and not interrupt <I>Simplicius.</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. The que$tion which you have $o ca$ually $tarted, is one
of the mo$t difficulty that is di$puted in Philo$ophy; and I have
on that $ubject mo$t excellent conceits of a very learned Doctor
of <I>Padoua,</I> but it is not now time to enter upon them. Therefore
returning to our purpo$e, I $ay that the Moon, in my opinion, is
much more $olid than the Earth, but do not infer the $ame, as you
do, from the craggine$s and montuo$ity of its $uperficies; but
<marg><I>The $uperficies of
the Moon more
$leek than any
Looking-gla&szlig;.</I></marg>
rather from the contrary, namely, from its aptitude to receive (as
we $ee it experimented in the harde$t $tones) a poli$h and lu$tre
exceeding that of the $moothe$t gla$s, for $uch nece$$arily mu$t
its $uperficies be, to render it apt to make $o lively reflection of
the Suns rays. And for tho$e appearances which you mention,
of Mountains, Cliffs, Hills, Valleys, <I>&amp;c.</I> they are all illu$ions:
and I have been pre$ent at certain publick di$putes, where I have
heard it $trongly maintained again$t the$e introducers of novelties,
<marg><I>The eminencies
and cavities in the
Moon are illu$ions
of its opacous and
perspicuous parts.</I></marg>
that $uch appearances proceed from nothing el$e, but from the un-
equal di$tribution of the opacous and per$picuous parts, of which
the Moon is inwardly and outwardly compo$ed: as we $ee it
often fall out in chry$tal, amber, and many other precious $tones
of perfect lu$tre; in which by rea$on of the opacity of $ome parts,
and the tran$parency of others, there doth appear $everal conca-
vities and prominencies. In the fourth re$emblance, I grant, that
the $uperficies of Terre$trial Globe beheld from afar, would make
two different appearances, namely, one more clear, the other more
dark; but I believe that $uch diver$ity would $ucceed quite con-
trary to what you $ay; that is, I hold that the $urface of the wa-
ter would appear lucid, becau$e that it is $mooth and tran$parent;
and that of the Earth would appear ob$cure, by rea$on of its o-
pacity and $cabro$ity, ill accommodated for reflecting the light of
the Sun. Concern&iuml;ng the fifth compari$on, I grant it wholly, and
am able, in ca$e the Earth did $hine as the Moon, to $how the
$ame to any one that $hould from thence above behold it, repre-
<foot>$ented</foot>
<p n=>56</p>
$ented by figures an$werable to tho$e which we $ee in the Moon:
I comprehend al$o, how the period of its illumination and varia-
tion of figure, would be monthly, albeit the Sun revolves round
about it in twenty four hours: and la$tly, I do not $cruple to
admit, that the half onely of the Moon $eeth all the Earth, and
that all the Earth $eeth but onely half of the Moon. For what
remains, I repute it mo$t fal$e, that the Moon can receive light
from the Earth, which is mo$t ob$cure, opacous, and utterly un-
apt to reflect the Suns light, as the Moon doth reflect it to us: and
as I have $aid, I hold that that light which we $ee in the remain-
der of the Moons face (the $plendid cre$cents $ubducted) by the
illumination, is the proper and natural light of the Moon, and no
ea$ie matter would induce me to believe otherwi$e. The $eventh,
touching the mutual Eclip$es, may be al$o admitted; howbeit
that is wont to be called the eclip$e of the Sun, which you are
plea$ed to phra$e the eclip$e of the Earth. And this is what <I>I</I>
have at this time to $ay in oppo$ition to your $even congruities
or re$emblances, to which objections, if you are minded to make
any reply, <I>I</I> $hall willingly hear you.</P>
<P>SALV. If I have well apprehended what you have an$wered, it
$eems to me, that there $till remains in controver$ie between us, cer-
tain conditions, which I made common betwixt the Moon &amp; Earth,
and they are the$e; You e$teem the Moon to be $mooth and poli$ht,
as a Looking-gla$s, and as $uch, able to reflect the Suns light; and
contrarily, the Earth, by rea$on of its montuo$ity, unable to make
$uch reflection: You yield the Moon to be $olid and hard, and that
you argue from its being $mooth and polite, and not from its being
montuous; and for its appearing montuous, you a$$ign as the
cau$e, that it con$i$ts of parts more and le$s opacous and per$pi-
cuous. And la$tly, you e$teem that $econdary light, to be proper
to the <I>M</I>oon, and not reflected from the Earth; howbeit you
$eem not to deny the $ea, as being of a $mooth $urface, $ome
kind of reflection. As to the convincing you of that error, that
the reflection of the <I>M</I>oon is made, as it were, like that of a
Looking-gla$s, <I>I</I> have $mall hope, whil$t <I>I</I> $ee, that what hath
<marg>* <I>Il Saggiatore, &amp;

been read in the ^{*} <I>Saggiator</I> and in the <I>Solar Letters</I> of our <I>Com-
mon Friend,</I> hath profited nothing in your judgment, if haply
you have attentively read what he hath there written on this $ub-
ject.</P>
<P>SIMPL. <I>I</I> have peru$ed the $ame $o $uperficially, according to
the $mall time of lea$ure allowed me from more $olid $tudies;
therefore, if you think you can, either by repeating $ome of tho$e
rea$ons, or by alledging others, re$olve me the$e doubts, <I>I</I> will
hearken to them attentively.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>I</I> will tell you what comes into my mind upon the
<foot>in$tant,</foot>
<p n=>57</p>
in$tant, and its po$$ible it may be a commixtion of my own con-
ceipts; and tho$e which I have $ometime read in the fore-$aid
Books, by which I well remember, that I was then perfectly
$atisfied, although the conclu$ions, at fir$t $ight $eem'd unto me
$trange Paradoxes. We enquire <I>Simplicius,</I> whether to the ma-
king a reflection of light, like that which we receive from the
Moon, it be nece$$ary that the $uperficies from whence the refle-
ction commeth, be $o $mooth and polite, as the face of a Looking-
Gla$$e, or whether a $uperficies not $mooth or poli$ht, but rough
and uneven, be more apt for $uch a purpo$e. Now $uppo$ing
two reflections $hould come unto us, one more bright, the other
le$$e, from two $uperficies oppo$ite unto us, I demand of you,
which of the two $uperficies you think would repre$ent it $elf to
our $ight, to be the cleare$t, and which the ob$cure$t.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I am very confident, that that $ame, which mo$t for-
cibly reflected the light upon me, would $hew its $elf in its a$pect
the clearer, and the other darker.</P>
<P>SALV. Be plea$ed to take that Gla$$e which hangs on yonder
<marg><I>It is proved at
large that the
Moons $urface is
$harp.</I></marg>
Wall, and let us go out into the Court-yard. Come <I>Sagredus.</I>
Now hang the gla$$e yonder, again$t that $ame Wall, on which
the Sun $hines, and now let us with-draw our $elves into the $hade.
See yonder two $uperficies beaten by the Sun, namely, the Wall
and the Gla$$e. Tell me now which appears cleare$t unto you,
that of the Wall or that of the Gla$$e? Why do you not an$wer
me?</P>
<P>SAGR. I leave the reply to <I>Simplicius,</I> who made the que$ti-
on; but I, for my own part, am per$waded upon this $mall be-
ginning of the experiment, that the Moon mu$t be of a very un-
poli$ht $urface.</P>
<P>SALV. What $ay you <I>Simplicius,</I> if you were to depaint that
Wall, and that Gla$$e fa$tened unto it, where would you u$e
your darke$t colours, in de$igning the Wall, or el$e in painting
the Looking-Gla$$e.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Much the darker in depainting the Gla$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Now if from the $uperficies, which repre$ents it $elf
more clear, there proceedeth a more powerful reflection of light,
the Wall will more forcibly reflect the raies of the Sun, than the
Gla$$e.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Very well, Sir, have you ever a better experiment
than this? you have placed us where the Gla$$e doth not rever-
berate upon us; but come along with me a little this way; how,
will you not $tir?</P>
<P>SAGR. You perhaps $eek the place of the reflection, which the
Gla$$e makth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I do $o.</P>
<foot>H SAGR</foot>
<p n=>58</p>
<P>SAGR. Why look you, there it is upon the oppo$ite Wall, ju$t
as big as the Gla$$e, and little le$$e bright than if the Sun had
directly $hined upon it.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Come hither therefore, and $ee from hence the $ur-
face of the Gla$$e, and tell me whether you think it more ob-
$cure than that of the Wall.</P>
<P>SAGR. Look on it your $elf, for I have no mind at this time,
to dazle my eyes; and I know very well, without $eeing it,
that it there appears as $plendid and bright as the Sun it $elf, or
little le$$e.</P>
<P>SIMPL. What $ay you therefore, is the reflection of a Gla$$e
le$$e powerful than that of a Wall? I $ee, that in this oppo$ite
Wall, where the reflection of the other illuminated Wall comes,
together with that of the Gla$$e, this of the Gla$$e is much
clearer; and I $ee likewi$e, that, from this place where I $tand,
the gla$$e it $elf appears with much more lu$tre than the Wall.</P>
<P>SALV. You have prevented me with your $ubtlety; for I $tood
in need of this very ob$ervation to demon$trate what remains.
You $ee then the difference which happens betwixt the two refle-
ctions made by the two $uperficies of the Wall and Gla$$e, per-
cu'$t in the $elf-$ame manner, by the rayes of the Sun; and you
$ee, how the reflection which comes from the Wall, diffu$eth it
$elf towards all the parts oppo$ite to it, but that of the Gla$$e
goeth towards one part onely, not at all bigger than the Gla$$e
it $elf: you $ee likewi$e, how the $uperficies of the Wall, beheld
from what part $oever, alwayes $hews it $elf of one and the $ame
cleerne$$e, and every way, much clearer than that of the Gla$$e,
excepting only in that little place, on which the Gla$$es reflection
reverberates, for from thence indeed the Gla$$e appears much more
lucid than the Wall. By the$e $o $en$ible, and palpable experi-
ments, my thinks one may $oon come to know, whether the
reflection which the Moon $ends upon us, proceed as from a
Gla$$e, or el$e, as from a Wall, that is, from a $mooth $uperfi-
cies, or a rugged.</P>
<P>SAGR. If I were in the Moon it $elf, I think I could not with
my hands more plainly feel the unevenne$$e of its $uperficies, than
I do now perceive it, by apprehending your di$cour$e. The Moon
beheld in any po$ture, in re$pect of the Sun and us, $heweth us
its $uperficies, touch't by the Suns rayes, alwayes equally clear;
an effect, which an$wers to an hair that of the Wall, which be-
held from what place $oever, appeareth equally bright, and dif-
fereth from the Gla$$e, which from one place onely appeareth lu-
cid, and from all others ob$cure. Moreover, the light which
cometh to me from the reflection of the Wall, is tollerable,
and weak, in compari$on of that of the Gla$$e, which is little
<foot>le$$e</foot>
<p n=>59</p>
le$$e forcible and offen$ive to the $ight, than that primary and
direct light of the Sun. And thus without trouble do we behold
the face of the Moon; which were it as a Gla$$e, it appearing to
us by rea$on of its vicinity, as big as the Sun it $elf, its $plendor
would be ab$olutely intollerable, and would $eem as if we beheld
another Sun.</P>
<P>SALV. A$cribe not, I be$eech you <I>Sagredus,</I> more to my de-
mon$tration, than it produceth. I will oppo$e you with an in$tance,
which I $ee not well how you can ea$ily re$olve. You in$i$t upon it
as a grand difference between the Moon and Gla$$e, that it emits
its reflection towards all parts equally, as doth the Wall; where-
as the Gla$$e ca$ts it upon one onely determinate place; and from
hence you conclude the Moon to be like to the Wall, and not to
the Gla$$e: But I mu$t tell you, that that $ame Gla$$e ca$ts its
<marg><I>Flat Looking-
gla$$es ca$t forth
the reflection to-
wards but one
place, but the
$pherical every
way.</I></marg>
reflection on one place onely, becau$e its $urface is flat, and the
reflex rayes being to depart at angles equal to tho$e of the rayes
of incidence, it mu$t follow that from a plane or flat $uperficies,
they do depart unitedly towards the $ame place; but in regard
that the $uperficies of the Moon is not plain, but $pherical, and
the incident rayes upon $uch a $uperficies, being to reflect them-
$elves at angles equal to tho$e of the incidence towards all parts,
by means of the infinity of the inclinations which compo$e the
$pherical $uperficies, therefore the Moon may $end forth its reflecti-
on every way; and there is no nece$$ity for its repercu$$ion upon one
place onely, as that Gla$$e which is flat.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This is one of the very $ame objections, which I in-
tended to have made again$t him.</P>
<P>SAGR. If this be one, you had need have more of them; yet
I tell you, that as to this fir$t, it $eems to me to make more a-
gain$t you, than for you.</P>
<P>SIMPL. You have pronounced as a thing manife$t, that the refle-
ction made by that Wall, is as cleer and lucid as that which the
Moon $ends forth, and I e$teem it nothing in compari$on thereto.
&ldquo;For, in this bu$ine$$e of the illumination, its requi$ite to re$pect,

but the C&oelig;le$tial bodies have greater Spheres of activity, than
the$e our elementary, frail, and mortal ones? and that Wall,
finally, what el$e is it but a little ob$cure Earth, unapt to
$hine?&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>S</I>AGR. And here al$o I believe, that you very much deceive your
felf. But I come to the fir$t objection moved by <I>Salviatus</I>; and
I con$ider, that to make a body appear unto us luminous, it $uf-
ficeth not that the rayes of the illuminating body fall upon it,
but it is moreover requi$ite that the reflex rayes arrive to our
eye; as is manife$tly $een in the example of that Gla$$e, upon
<foot>H 2 which</foot>
<p n=>60</p>
which, without que$tion, the illuminating rayes of the Sun do
come; yet neverthele$$e, it appears not to us bright and $hining,
unle$$e we $et our eye in that particular place, where the refle-
ction arriveth. Now let us con$ider what would $ucceed, were
the gla$$e of a $pherical figure; for without doubt, we $hould
find, that of the reflection made by the whole $urface illumina-
ted, that to be but a very $mall part, which arriveth to the eye
of a particular beholder; by rea$on that that is but an incon$ide-
rable particle of the whole $pherical $uperficies, the inclination
of which ca$ts the ray to the particular place of the eye; whence
the part of the $pherical $uperficies, which $hews it $elf $hining
to the eye, mu$t needs be very $mall; all the re$t being repre-
$ented ob$cure. So that were the Moon $mooth, as a Looking-
<marg><I>The Moon if it
were $mooth, like a
$pherical gla$$e,
would be invi$ible.</I></marg>
gla$$e, a very $mall part would be $een by any particular eye to
be illu$trated by the Sun, although its whole Hemi$phere were ex-
po$ed to the Suns rayes; and the re$t would appear to the eye of
the beholder as not illuminated, and therefore invi$ible; and
finally, the whole Moon would be likewi$e invi$ible, for $o much
as that particle, whence the reflection $hould come, by rea$on of
its $malne$$e and remotene$$e, would be lo$t. And as it would be
invi$ible to the eye, $o would it not afford any light; for it is al-
together impo$$ible, that a bright body $hould take away our
darkne$$e by its $plendor, and we not to $ee it.</P>
<P>SALV. Stay good <I>Sagredus,</I> for I $ee $ome emotions in
the face and eyes of <I>Simplicius,</I> which are to me as indices that
he is not either very apprehen$ive of, or $atisfied with this which
you, with admirable proof, and ab$olute truth have $poken.
And yet I now call to mind, that I can by another experiment
remove all $cruple. I have $een above in a Chamber, a great
$pherical Looking-gla$$e; let us $end for it hither, and while$t it
is in bringing, let <I>Simplicius</I> return to con$ider, how great the
clarity is which cometh to the Wall here, under the penthou$e,
from the reflection of the flat gla$$e.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I $ee it is little le$$e $hining, than if the Sun had di-
rectly beat upon it.</P>
<P>SALV. So indeed it is. Now tell me, if taking away that $mall
flat gla$$e, we $hould put that great $pherical one in the $ame
place, what effect (think you) would its reflection have upon the
$ame Wall?</P>
<P><I>S</I>IMPL. I believe that it would eject upon it a far greater and
more diffu$ed light.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. But if the illumination $hould be nothing, or $o
$mall, that you would $car$e di$cern it, what would you $ay
then?</P>
<P><I>S</I>IMPL. When I have $een the effect, I will bethink my $elf
of an an$wer.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>61</p>
<P>SALV. See here is the gla$$e, which I would have to be placed
clo$e to the other. But fir$t let us go yonder towards the reflection
of that flat one, and attentively ob$erve its clarity; $ee how
bright it is here where it $hines, and how di$tinctly one may di$cern
the$e $mall unevenne$$es in the Wall.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have $een and very well ob$erved the $ame, now place
the other gla$$e by the $ide of the fir$t.</P>
<P>SALV. See where it is. It was placed there a$$oon as you be-
gan to look upon the Walls $mall unevenne$$es, and you percei-
ved it not, $o great was the encrea$e of the light all over the re$t of
the Wall. Now take away the flat gla$$e. Behold now all refle-
ction removed, though the great convex gla$$e $till remaineth.
Remove this al$o, and place it there again if you plea$e, and you
$hall $ee no alteration of light in all the Wall. See here then de-
mon$trated to $en$e, that the reflection of the Sun, made upon a
$pherical convex gla$$e, doth not $en$ibly illuminate the places neer
unto it. Now what $ay you to this experiment?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I am afraid that there may be $ome <I>Leigerdemain,</I>
u$ed in this affair; yet in beholding that gla$$e I $ee it dart forth
a great $plendor, which dazleth my eyes; and that which im-
ports mo$t of all, I $ee it from what place $oever I look upon it;
and I $ee it go changing $ituation upon the $uperficies of the gla$$e,
which way $oever I place my $elf to look upon it; a nece$$ary ar-
gument, that the light is livelily reflected towards every $ide, and
con$equently, as $trongly upon all that Wall, as upon my eye.</P>
<P>SALV. Now you $ee how cautiou$ly and re$ervedly you ought
to proceed in lending your a$$ent to that, which di$cour$e alone re-
pre$enteth to you. There is no doubt but that this which you $ay,
carrieth with it probability enough, yet you may $ee, how $en$i-
ble experience proves the contrary.</P>
<P>SIMPL. How then doth this come to pa$s?</P>
<P>SALV. I will deliver you my thoughts thereof, but I cannot
tell how you may be plea$'d therewith. And fir$t, that lively
$plendor which you $ee upon the gla$s, and which you think occu-
pieth a good part thereof, is nothing near $o great, nay is very ex-
ceeding $mall; but its liveline$s occa$ioneth in your eye, (by means
of the reflection made on the humidity of the extream parts of the
eye-brows, which di$tendeth upon the pupil) an adventitious irradi-
ation, like to that blaze which we think we $ee about the flame of
a candle placed at $ome di$tance; or if you will, you may
re$emble it to the adventitious $plendor of a $tar; for if you $hould
<marg><I>The $mall body of

ry much biggerthan
plain and naked,
and in its native
clarity.</I></marg>
compare the $mall body <I>v. g.</I> of the <I>Canicula,</I> $een in the day time
with the <I>Tele$cope,</I> when it is $een without $uch irradiation, with
the $ame $een by night by the eye it $elf, you will doubtle$s com-
prehend that being irradiated, it appeareth above a thou$and
<foot>times</foot>
<p n=>62</p>
times bigger than the naked and real body: and a like or greater
augmentation doth the image of the Sun make, which you $ee in
that gla$s. I $ay greater, for that it is more lively than the $tar,
as is manife$t from our being able to behold the $tar with much
le$s offence, than this reflection of the gla$s. The reverberation
therefore which is to di$pere it $elf all over this wall, cometh from
a $mall part of that gla$s, and that which even now came from
the whole flat gla$s di$per$ed and re$train'd it $elf to a very $mall
part of the $aid wall. What wonder is it then, that the fir$t re-
flection very lively illuminates, and that this other is almo$t im-
perceptible?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I find my $elf more perplexed than ever, and there
pre$ents it $elf unto me the other difficulty, how it can be that
that wall, being of a matter $o ob$cure, and of a $uperficies $o un-
poli$h'd, $hould be able to dart from it greater light, than a gla$s
very $mooth and polite.</P>
<P>SALV. Greater light it is not, but more univer$al; for as to
the degree of brightne$s, you $ee that the reflection of that $mall
flat gla$s, where it beamed forth yonder under the $hadow of the
penthou$e, illuminateth very much; and the re$t of the wall which
receiveth the reflection of the wall on which the gla$s is placed,
is not in any great mea$ure illuminated, as was the $mall part on
which the reflection of the gla$s fell. And if you would under-
$tand the whole of this bu$ine$s, you mu$t con$ider that the $uper-
<marg><I>The reflex light
of uneven bodies, is
more univer$al
than that of the
$mooth, &amp; why.</I></marg>
ficies of that wall's being rough, is the $ame as if it were compo-
$ed of innumerable $mall $uperficies, di$po$ed according to in-
numerable diver$ities of inclinations: among$t which it nece$$a-
rily happens, that there are many di$po$ed to $end forth their
reflex rays from them into $uch a place, many others into another:
and in $um, there is not any place to which there comes not very
many rays, reflected from very many $mall $uperficies, di$per$ed
throughout the whole $uperficies of the rugged body, upon which
the rays of the Sun fall. From which it nece$$arily follow-
eth, That upon any, what$oever, part of any $uperficies,
oppo$ed to that which receiveth the primary incident rays,
there is produced reflex rays, and con$equently illumi-
nation. There doth al$o follow thereupon, That the $ame
body upon which the illuminating rays fall, beheld from
what$oever place, appeareth all illuminated and $hining: and
therefore the Moon, as being of a $uperficies rugged and
<marg><I>The Moon, if it
were $mooth and
$leek, would be in-
vi$ible.</I></marg>
not $mooth, beameth forth the light of the Sun on every
$ide, and to all beholders appeareth equally lucid. But if
the $urface of it, being $pherical, were al$o $mooth as a gla$s, it
would become wholly invi$ible; fora$much as that $mall part,
from which the image of the Sun $hould be reflected unto the eye
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>63</p>
of a particular per$on, by rea$on of its great di$tance would be in-
vi$ible, as I have $aid before.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I am very apprehen$ive of your di$cour$e; yet me-
thinks I am able to re$olve the $ame with very little trouble; and
ea$ily to maintain, that the Moon is rotund and polite, and that it
reflects the Suns light unto us in manner of a gla$s; nor there-
fore ought the image of the Sun to be $een in the middle of it, &ldquo;for-
a$much as the $pecies of the Sun it $elf admits not its $mall figure
to be $een at $o great a di$tance, but the light produced by the
Sun may help us to conceive that it illuminateth the whole Lu-
nar Body: a like effect we may $ee in a plate gilded and well
polli$h'd, which touch't by a luminous body, appeareth to him
that beholds it at $ome di$tance to be all $hining; and onely near
at hand one may di$cover in the middle of it the $mall image of
the luminous body.&rdquo;</P>
<P>SALV. Ingenuou$ly confe$$ing my dullne$s of apprehen$ion,
I mu$t tell you, that I under$tand not any thing of this your di$-
cour$e, $ave onely what concerns the gilt plate: and if you permit
me to $peak freely, I have a great conceit that you al$o under$tand
not the $ame, but have learnt by heart tho$e words written by $ome
one out of a de$ire of contradiction, and to $hew him$elf more intel-
ligent than his adver$ary; but it mu$t be to tho$e, which to appear
al$o more wi$e, applaud that which they do not under$tand, and
entertain a greater conceit of per$ons, the le$s they are by them
under$tood: and the writer him$elf may be one of tho$e (of which
there are many) who write what they do not under$tand, and
<marg><I>Some write what
they under$tand
not, and therefore
under$tand not
what they write.</I></marg>
con$equently under$tand not what they write. Therefore, o-
mitting the re$t, I reply, as to the gilt plate, that if it be flat and
not very big, it may appear at a di$tance very bright, whil$t a great
light beameth upon it, but yet it mu$t be when the eye is in a de-
terminate line, namely in that of the reflex rays: and it will ap-
pear the more $hining, if it were <I>v. g.</I> of $ilver, by means of its
being burni$hed, and apt through the great den$ity of the metal,
to receive a perfect poli$h. And though its $uperficies, being very
well brightned, were not exactly plain, but $hould have various in-
clinations, yet then al$o would its $plendor be $een many ways;
namely, from as many places as the various reflections, made by
the $everal $uperficies, do reach: for therefore are Diamonds
<marg><I>Diamonds ground
to divers $ides, &amp;
why.</I></marg>
ground to many $ides, that $o their plea$ing lu$tre might be beheld
from many places. But if the Plate were very big, though it $hould
be all plain, yet would it not at a di$tance appear all over $hining:
and the better to expre$s my $elf, Let us $uppo$e a very large gilt
plate expo$ed to the Sun, it will $hew to an eye far di$tant, the
image of the Sun, to occupy no more but a certain part of the $aid
plate; to wit, that from whence the reflection of the incident
<foot>$olar</foot>
<p n=>64</p>
$olar rays come: but it is true that by the vivacity of the light, the
$aid image will appear fringed about with many rays, and $o will
$eem to occupie a far greater part of the plate, than really it doth.
And to $hew that this is true, when you have noted the particular
place of the plate from whence the reflection cometh, and concei-
ved likewi$e how great the $hining place appeared to you, cover the
greater part of that $ame $pace, leaving it only vi$ible about the
mid$t; and all this $hall not any whit dimini$h the apparent $plen-
dor to one that beholds it from afar; but you $hall $ee it largely
di$pers'd upon the cloth or other matter, wherewith you covered
it. If therefore any one, by $eeing from a good di$tance a $mall
gilt plate to be all over $hining, $hould imagine that the $ame
would al$o even in a plate as broad as the Moon, he is no le$s de-
ceived, than if he $hould believe the Moon to be no bigger than
the bottom of a tub. If again the plate were turn'd into a $phe-
rical $uperficies, the reflection would be $een $trong in but one $ole
particle of it; but yet by rea$on of its liveline$s, it will appear
fringed about with many glittering rays: the re$t of the Ball would
appear according as it was burni$hed; and this al$o onely then
<marg><I>Silver burni$hed
appears more ob-
$cuee, than the not
burni$hed, &amp; why.</I></marg>
when it was not very much poli$hed, for $hould it be perfectly
brightned, it would appear ob$cure. An example of this we
have dayly before our eyes in $ilver ve$$els, which whil$t they are
only boyl'd in the <I>Argol</I> and <I>Salt,</I> they are all as white as $now, and
do not reflect any image; but if they be in any part burni$h'd, they
become in that place pre$ently ob$cure: and in them one may $ee the
repre$entation of any thing as in Looking-gla$$es. And that chan-
to ob$curity, proceeds from nothing el$e but the $moothing and
plaining of a fine grain, which made the $uperficies of the $ilver
rough, and yet $uch, as that it reflected the light into all parts,
whereby it $eemed from all parts equally illuminated: which
$mall unevenne$$es, when they come to be exqui$itely plained by
the burni$h, $o that the reflection of the rays of incidence are all
directed unto one determinate place; then, from that $ame place,
the burni$h'd part $hall $hew much more bright and $hining than
the re$t which is onely whitened by boyling; but from all other
places it looks very ob$cure. And note, that the diver$ity of
<marg><I>Burni$h'd Steel
beheld from one
place appears very
bright, and from
another, very ob-
$cure.</I></marg>
$ights of looking upon burni$h'd $uperficies, occa$ioneth $uch
difference in appearances, that to imitate and repre$ent in picture,
<I>v. g.</I> a poli$h'd Cuirace, one mu$t couple black plains with white,
one $ideways to the other, in tho$e parts of the arms where the
light falleth equally.</P>
<P>SAGR. If therefore the$e great Philo$ophers would acquie$e
in granting, that the Moon, <I>Venus</I> and the other Planets, were not
of $o bright and $mooth a $urface as a Looking-gla$s, but wanted
$ome $mall matter of it, namely, were as a $ilver plate, onely boyled
<foot>white,</foot>
<p n=>65</p>
white, but not burni$hed; would this yet $uffice to the making
of it vi$ible, and apt for darting forth the light of the Sun?</P>
<P>SALV. It would $uffice in part; but would not give a light $o
$trong, as it doth being mountainous, and in $um, full of
eminencies and great cavities. But the$e Philo$ophers will never
yield it to be le$$e polite than a gla$$e; but far more, if more it
can be imagined; for they e$teeming that to perfect bodies perfect
figures are mo$t $utable; it is nece$$ary, that the $phericity of tho$e
C&oelig;le$tial Globes be mo$t exact; be$ides, that if they $hould
grant me $ome inequality, though never $o $mall, I would not
$cruple to take any other greater; for that $uch perfection con$i$t-
ing in indivi$ibles, an hair doth as much detract from its perfection
as a mountain.</P>
<P>SAGR. Here I meet with two difficulties, one is to know the
rea$on why the greater inequality of $uperficies maketh the $tron-
ger reflection of light; the other is, why the$e <I>Peripatetick</I> Gen-
tlemen are for this exact figure.</P>
<P>SALV. I will an$wer to the fir$t; and leave to <I>Simplieius</I> the
<marg><I>The more rough
$uperficies make
greater reflection
of light, than the
le$s rough.</I></marg>
care of making reply to the $econd. You mu$t know therefore,
that the $ame $uperficies happen to be by the $ame light more or le$s
illuminated, according as the rayes of illumination fall upon them
<marg><I>Perpendicular
rays illuminate
more than the ob-
lique, and why.</I></marg>
more or le$$e obliquely; $o that the greate$t illumination is where
the rayes are perpendicular. And $ee, how I will prove it to your
$en$e. I bend this paper, $o, that one part of it makes an angle
upon the other: and expo$ing both the$e parts to the reflection of
the light of that oppo$ite Wall, you $ee how this $ide which re-
ceiveth the rayes obliquely, is le$$e $hining than this other, where
the reflection fals at right angles; and ob$erve, that as I by
degrees receive the illumination more obliquely, it groweth
weaker.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $ee the effect, but comprehend not the cau$e.</P>
<P>SALV. If you thought upon it but a minute of an hour, you
would find it; but that I may not wa$te the time, $ee a kind of
demon$tration thereof in <I>Fig.</I> 7.</P>
<P>SAGR. The bare $ight of this Figure hath fully $atisfied me,
therefore proceed.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Pray you let me hear you out, for I am not of $o
quick an apprehen$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. Fancie to your $elf, that all the paralel lines, which you
$ee to depart from the terms A. B. are the rays which fall upon the
<marg><I>The more oblique
Rayes illuminate
le&szlig;, and why.</I></marg>
line C. D. at right angles: then incline the $aid C. D. till it hang
as D. O. now do not you $ee that a great part of tho$e rays which
peirce C. D. pa$s by without touching D. O? If therefore D. O.
be illuminated by fewer rays, it is very rea$onable, that the light
received by it be more weak. Let us return now to the Moon,
<foot>I which</foot>
<p n=>66</p>
which being of a $pherical figure, if its $uperficies were $mooth, as
this paper, the parts of its hemi$phere illuminated by the Sun,
which are towards its extremity, would receive much le$s light,
than the middle parts; the rays falling upon them mo$t obliquely,
and upon the$e at right angles; whereupon at the time of full
Moon, when we $ee almo$t its whole Hemi$phere illuminated, the
parts towards the mid$t, would $hew them$elves to us with more
$plendor, than tho$e others towards the circumference: which is
not $o in effect. Now the face of the Moon being repre$ented
to me full of indifferent high mountains, do not you $ee how their
tops and continuate ridges, being elevated above the convexity of
the perfect $pherical $uperficies, come to be expo$ed to the view
of the Sun, and accommodated to receive its rays much le$s ob-
liquely, and con$equently to appear as luminous as the re$t?</P>
<P>SAGR. All this I well perceive: and if there are $uch moun-
tains, its true, the Sun will dart upon them much more directly
than it would do upon the inclination of a polite $uperficies: but
it is al$o true, that betwixt tho$e mountains all the valleys would
become ob$cure, by rea$on of the va$t $hadows, which in that
time would be ca$t from the mountains, whereas the parts towards
the middle, though full of valleys and hills, by rea$on they have
the Sun elevated, would appear without $hadow, and therefore
more lucid by far than the extreme parts, which are no le$s diffu-
$ed with $hadow than light, and yet we can perceive no $uch diffe-
rence.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I was ruminating upon the like difficulty.</P>
<P>SALV. How much readier is <I>Simplicius</I> to apprehend the ob-
jections which favour the opinions of <I>Ari$totle,</I> than their $oluti-
ons? I have a kind of $u$pition, that he $trives al$o $ometimes to
di$$emble them; and in the pre$ent ca$e, he being of him$elf able
to hit upon the doubt, which yet is very ingenious, I cannot be-
lieve but that he al$o was advi$'d of the an$wer; wherefore I will
attempt to wre$t the $ame (as they $ay) out of his mouth. There-
fore tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> do you think there can be any $hadow,
where the rays of the Sun do $hine?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I believe, nay I am certain that there cannot; for that
it being the grand luminary, which with its rays driveth away dark-
ne$s, it is impo$$ible any tenebro$ity $hould remain where it com-
eth; moreover, we have the definition, that <I>Tenebr&aelig; $unt priva-
tio luminis.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Therefore the Sun, beholding the Earth, Moon or o-
ther opacous body, never $eeth any of its $hady parts, it not ha-
ving any other eyes to $ee with, $ave its rays, the conveyers of
light: and con$equently, one $tanding in the Sun would never
$ee any thing of umbrage, fora$much as his vi$ive rays would ever
<foot>go</foot>
<p n=>67</p>
go accompanied with tho$e illuminating beams of the Sun.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This is true, without any contradiction.</P>
<P>SALV. But when the Moon is oppo$ite to the Sun, what dif-
ference is there between the tract of the rayes of your $ight, and
that motion which the Suns rayes make?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Now I under$tand you; for you would $ay, that the
rayes of the $ight and tho$e of the Sun, moving by the $ame lines,
we cannot perceive any of the ob$cure valleys of the Moon. Be
plea$ed to change this your opinion, that I have either $imulation
or di$$imulation in me; for I prote$t unto you, as I am a Gentle-
man, that I did not gue$$e at this $olution, nor $hould I have
thought upon it, without your help, or without long $tudy.</P>
<P>SAGR. The re$olutions, which between you two have been
alledged touching this la$t doubt, hath, to $peak the truth, $atisfi-
ed me al$o. But at the $ame time this con$ideration of the vi-
fible rayes accompanying the rayes of the Sun, hath begotten in me
another $cruple, about the other part, but I know not whether I
can expre$$e it right, or no: for it but ju$t now comming into my
mind, I have not yet methodized it to my mind: but let us $ee if
we can, all together, make it intelligible. There is no que$tion,
but that the parts towards the circumference of that poli$h't, but not
burni$h't Hemi$phere, which is illuminated by the Sun, receiving the
rayes obliquely, receive much fewer thereof, than the middle-
mo$t parts, which receive them directly. And its po$$ible, that a
tract or $pace of <I>v. g.</I> twenty degrees in breadth, and which is to-
wards the extremity of the Hemi$phere, may not receive more rays
than another towards the middle parts, of but four degree broad:
$o that that doubtle$s will be much more ob$cure than this; and
$uch it will appear to whoever $hall behold them both in the face,
or (as I may $ay) in their full magnitude. But if the eye of the
beholder were con$tituted in $uch a place, that the breadth of the
twenty degrees of the ob$cure $pace, appeared not to it longer
than one of four degrees, placed in the mid$t of the Hemi$phere,
I hold it not impo$$ible for it to appear to the $aid beholder e-
qually clear and lucid with the other; becau$e, finally, between
two equal angles, to wit, of four degrees apiece, there come to
the eye the reflections of two equal numbers of rayes: namely,
tho$e which are reflected from the middlemo$t $pace, four degrees
in breadth, and tho$e reflected from the other of twenty degrees,
but $een by compre$$ion, under the quantity of four degrees: and
$uch a $ituation $hall the eye obtain, when it is placed between the
$aid Hemi$phere, and the body which illuminates it; for then the
$ight and rayes move in the $ame lines. It $eemeth not impo$$ible
therefore, but that the Moon may be of a very equal $uperficies;
and that neverthele$$e, it may appear when it is at the full, no le$s
<foot>I 2 light</foot>
<p n=>68</p>
light in the extremities, than in the middle parts.</P>
<P>SALV. The doubt is ingenious and worthy of con$ideration;
and as it but ju$t now came into your mind unawares, $o I will
like wi$e an$wer with what fir$t comes into my thoughts, and it may
happily fall out, that by thinking more upon it, I may $tumble
upon a better reply. But before, that I labyrinth my $elf any far-
ther, it would be nece$$ary, that we a$$ure our $elves by $ome ex-
periment, whether your objection prove in effect, what it $eemeth
to conclude in appearance; and therefore taking once more the
$ame paper, and making it to incline, by bending a little part
thereof upon the remainder, let us try whether expo$ing it to the
Sun, $o that the rayes of light fall upon the le$$er part directly,
and upon the other obliquely; this which receiveth the rayes direct-
ly appeareth more lucid; and $ee here by manife$t experience,
that it is notably more clear. Now if your objection be conclu$ive,
it will follow, that $tooping with our eye $o, that in beholding
the other greater part, le$s illuminated, in compre$$ion or fore-
$hortning, it appear unto us no bigger than the other, more $hining;
and that con$equently, it be not beheld at a greater angle than
that; it will nece$$arily en$ue, I $ay, that its light be encrea$ed, $o
that it do $eem to us as bright as the other. See how I behold, and
look upon it $o obliquely, that it appeareth to me narrower than
the other; but yet, notwith$tanding its ob$curity, doth not to
my perceiving, at all grow clearer. Try now if the $ame $ucceed
to you.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have look't upon it, and though I have $tooped with
my eye, yet cannot I $ee the $aid $uperficies encrea$e in light or
clarity; nay me thinks it rather grows more dusky.</P>
<P>SALV. We are hitherto confident of the invalidity of the ob-
jection; In the next place, as to the $olution, I believe, that, by
rea$on the Superficies of this paper is little le$$e than $mooth, the
rayes are very few, which be reflected towards the point of inci-
dence, in compari$on of the multitude, which are reflected to-
wards the oppo$ite parts; and that of tho$e few more and more
are lo$t, the nearer the vi$ive rayes approach to tho$e lucid rayes
of incidence; and becau$e it is not the incident rayes, but tho$e
which are reflected to the eye, that make the object appear lu-
minous; therefore, in $tooping the eye, there is more lo$t than got,
as you your $elf confe$$e to have $een in looking upon the ob$cu-
rer part of the paper.</P>
<P>SAGR. I re$t $atisfied with this experiment and rea$on: It re-
mains now, that <I>Simplicius</I> an$wer to my other que$tion, and tell
me what moves the <I>Peripateticks</I> to require this $o exact rotundity
in the C&oelig;le$tial bodies.</P>
<P>SIMPL. The C&oelig;le$tial bodies being ingenerable, inalterable, im-
<foot>pa$$ible,</foot>
<p n=>69</p>
pa$$ible, immortal, <I>&amp;c.</I> they mu$t needs be ab$olutely perfect; and
<marg><I>Perfect $phericity
why a$cribed to
C&oelig;lestial bodies,
by the</I> Peripate-
ticks.</marg>
their being ab$olute perfect, nece$$arily implies that there is in them
all kinds of perfection; and con$equently, that their figure be al$o
perfect, that is to $ay, $pherical; and ab$olutely and perfectly
$pherical, and not rough and irregular.</P>
<P>SALV. And this incorruptibility, from whence do you prove
it?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Immediately by its freedom from contraries, and me-
diately, by its $imple circular motion.</P>
<P>SALV. So that; by what I gather from your di$cour$e, in ma-
<marg><I>The Figure is not
the cau$e of incor-
ruptibility, but of
longer duration.</I></marg>
king the e$$ence of the C&oelig;le$tial bodies to be incorruptible, inal-
terable, <I>&amp;c,</I> there is no need of rotundity as a cau$e, or requi-
$ite; for if this $hould cau$e inalterability, we might at our plea-
$ure make wood, wax, and other Elementary matters, incorrup-
tible, by reducing them to a $pherical figure.</P>
<P>SIMPL. And is it not manife$t that a ball of Wood will better
and longer be preferved, than an oblong, or other angular fi-
gure, made of a like quantity of the $ame wood.</P>
<P>SALV. This is mo$t certain, but yet it doth not of corruptible
become incorruptible, but $till remains corruptible, though of a
much longer duration. Therefore you mu$t note, that a thing cor-
<marg><I>Corruptibility ad-
mits of more or
le$$e; $o doth noe
incorruptibiliiy.</I></marg>
ruptible, is capable of being more or le$$e $uch, and we may
properly $ay this is le$$e corruptible than that; as for example, the
<I>Ja$per,</I> than the <I>Pietra Sirena</I>; but incorruptibility admits not
of more, or le$$e, $o as that it may be $aid this is more incorrupti-
ble than that, if both be incorruptible and eternal. The diver-
<marg><I>The perfection of
figure, operateth
in corruptible bo-
dies, but not in the
eternal.</I></marg>
$ity of figure therefore cannot operate: $ave onely in matters ca-
pable of more or le$$e duration; but in the eternal, which can-
not be other than equally eternal, the operation of figure cea$eth.
And therefore, $ince the C&oelig;le$tial matter is not incorruptible by
figure, but otherwayes no man needs to be $o $olicitous for this
perfect $phericity; for if the matter be incorruptible, let it have
what figure it will, it $hall be alwayes $uch.</P>
<P>SAGR. But I am con$idering another thing, and $ay, that if
<marg><I>If the $pherical fi-
gure conferreth e-
ternity, all bodies
would be eternal.</I></marg>
we $hould grant the $pherical figure a faculty of conferring incor-
ruptibility, all bodies of what$oever figure, would be incorrupti-
ble; fora$much as if the rotund body be incorruptible, corrupti-
bility would then $ub$i$t in tho$e parts which alter the perfect ro-
tundity; as for in$tance, there is in a <I>Die</I> a body perfectly round,
and, as $uch, incorruptible; therefore it remaineth that tho$e an-
gles be corruptible which cover and hide the rotundity; $o that
the mo$t that could happen, would be, that tho$e angles, and
(to $o $peak) excre$cencies, would corrupt. But if we proceed to a
more inward con$ideration, that in tho$e parts al$o towards the
angles, there are compri$ed other le$$er bals of the $ame matter;
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>70</p>
and therefore they al$o, as being round, mu$t be al$o incorrup-
tible; and likewife in the remainders, which environ the$e eight
le$$er Spheres, a man may under$tand that there are others: $o
that in the end, re$olving the whole <I>Die</I> into innumerable balls,
it mu$t nece$$arily be granted incorruptible. And the $ame di$-
cour$e and re$olution may be made in all other figures.</P>
<P>SALV. Your method in making the conclu$ion, for if <I>v. g.</I> a
round Chry$tal were, by rea$on of its figure, incorruptible; namely,
received from thence a faculy of re$i$ting all internal and external
alterations, we $hould not find, that the joyning to it other Chry-
$tal, and reducing it <I>v. g.</I> into a Cube, would any whit alter it
within, or without; $o as that it would thereupon become le$$e
apt to re$i$t the new ambient, made of the $ame matter, than it
was to re$i$t the other, of a matter different; and e$pecially, if
it be true, that corruption is generated by contraries, as <I>Ari-
$totle</I> $aith; and with what can you enclo$e that ball of Cry$tal,
that is le$$e contrary to it, than Cry$tal it $elf? But we are not a-
ware how time flies away; and it will be too late before we come
to an end of our di$pute, if we $hould make $o long di$cour$es,
upon every particular; be$ides our memories are $o confounded
in the multiplicity of notions, that I can very hardly recal to
mind the Propot$iions, which I propo$ed in order to <I>Simplicius,</I>
for our con$ideration.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I very well remember them: And as to this particular
que$tion of the montuo$ity of the Moon, there yet remains un-
an$wered that which I have alledged, as the cau$e, (and which
may very well $erve for a $olution) of that <I>Ph&aelig;nomenon,</I> $aying,
that it is an illu$ion proceeding from the parts of the Moon, be-
ing unequally opacous, and per$picuous.</P>
<P>SAGR. Even now, when <I>Simplicius</I> a$cribed the apparent Pro-
tnberancies or unevenne$$es of the Moon (according to the opinion
of a certain <I>Peripatetick</I> his friend) to the diver$ly opacous, and
<marg><I>Mother of Pearl
accommodated to
imitate the appa-
rent unevenne$$es
of the Moons $ur-
face.</I></marg>
per$picuous parts of the $aid Moon, conformable to which the like
illu$ions are $een in Cry$tal, and Jems of divers kinds, I bethought
my $elf of a matter much more commodious for the repre$enting
$uch effects; which is $uch, that I verily believe, that that Philo$o-
pher would give any price for it; and it is the mother of Pearl, which
is wrought into divers figures, and though it be brought to an ex-
treme evenne$$e, yet it $eemeth to the eye in $everal parts, $o vari-
ou$ly hollow and knotty, that we can $carce credit our feeling of
their evenne$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. This invention is truly ingenious; and that which hath
not been done already, may be done in time to come; and if
there have been produced other Jems, and Cry$tals, which have
nothing to do with the illu$ions of the mother of Pearl, the$e may
<foot>be</foot>
<p n=>71</p>
be produced al$o; in the mean time, that I may not prevent any
one, I will $uppre$$e the an$wer which might be given, and onely
for this time betake my $elf to $atisfie the objections brought by
<I>Simplicius.</I> I $ay therefore, that this rea$on of yours is too ge-
neral, and as you apply it not to all the appearances one by one;
which are $een in the Moon, and for which my $elf and others
are induced to hold it mountainous, I believe you will not find
any one that will be $atisfied with $uch a doctrine; nor can I think,
that either you, or the Author him$elf, find in it any greater
quietude, than in any other thing wide from the purpo$e. Of the
<marg><I>The apparent un-
evenne$$es of the
Moon cannot be i-
mitated by way of
more and le$s opa-
city &amp; per$picuity.</I></marg>
very many $everal appearances which are $een night by night in
the cour$e of Moon, you cannot imitate $o much as one, by making
a Ball at your choice, more or le$s opacous and per$picuous, and
that is of a polite $uperficies; whereas on the contrary, one may
<marg><I>The various a-

make Balls of any $olid matter what$oever, that is not tran$parent,
which onely with eminencies and cavities, and by receiving the il-
lumination $everal ways, $hall repre$ent the $ame appearances and
mutations to an hair, which from hour to hour are di$covered in
<marg><I>Various appear an-
ces from which the

is argued.</I></marg>
the Moon. In them you $hall $ee the ledges of Hills expo$ed to
the Suns light, to be very $hining, and after them the projections
of their $hadows very ob$cure; you $hall $ee them greater and le$s,
according as the $aid eminencies $hall be more or le$s di$tant from
the confines which di$tingui$h the parts of the Moon illuminated,
from the ob$cure: you $hall $ee the $ame term and confine, not
equally diftended, as it would be if the Ball were poli$h'd, but
craggie and rugged. You $hall $ee beyond the $ame term, in the
dark parts of the Moon many bright prominencies, and di$tinct
from the re$t of the illuminations: you $hall $ee the $hadows a-
fore$aid, according as the illumination gradually ri$eth, to demi-
ni$h by degrees, till they wholly di$appear; nor are there any of
them to be $een when the whole Hemi$phere is enlightned. A-
gain on the contrary, in the lights pa$$age towards the other He-
mi$phere of the Moon, you $hall again ob$erve the $ame eminen-
cies that were marked, and you $hall $ee the projections of their
$hadows to be made a contrary way, and to decrea$e by degrees:
of which things, once more I $ay, you cannot $hew me $o much as
one in yours that are opacous and per$picuous.</P>
<P>SAGR. One of them certainly he may imitate, namely, that of
the Full-Moon, when by rea$on of its being all illuminated, there
is not to be $een either $hadow, or other thing, which receiveth
any alteration from its eminencies and cavities. But I be$eech
you, <I>Salviatus,</I> let us $pend no more time on this Argument, for
a per$on that hath had but the patience to make ob$ervation of but
one or two Lunations, and is not $atisfied with this mo$t $en$ible
truth, may well be adjudged void of all judgment; and upon
<foot>$uch</foot>
<p n=>72</p>
$uch why $hould we throw away our time and breath in vain?</P>
<P>SIMPI. I mu$t confe$s I have not made the ob$ervations, for
that I never had $o much curio$ity, or the In$truments proper for
the bu$ine$s; but I will not fail to do it. In the mean time, we
may leave this que$tion in $u$pen$e, and pa$s to that point which
follows, producing the motives inducing you to think that the
Earth may reflect the light of the Sun no le$s forceably than the
Moon, for it $eems to me $o ob$cure and opacous, that I judg $uch
an effect altogether impo$$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. The cau$e for which you repute the Earth unapt for
illumination, may rather evince the contrary: And would it not
be $trange, <I>Simplicius,</I> if I $hould apprehend your di$cour$es bet-
ter than you your $elf?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Whether I argue well or ill, it may be, that you may
better under$tand the $ame than I; but be it ill or well that I
di$cour$e, I $hall never believe that you can penetrate what I mean
better than I my $elf.</P>
<P>SALV. Well, I will make you believe the $ame pre$ently. Tell
me a little, when the Moon is near the Full, $o that it may be $een
by day, and al$o at midnight, at what do you think it more $plen-
did, by day or by night?</P>
<P>SIMPL. By night, without all compari$on. And methinks
<marg><I>The Moon ap-
pears brighter by
night than by day.</I></marg>
the Moon re$embleth that pillar of Clouds and pillar of Fire,
which guided the <I>I$raelites</I>; which at the pre$ence of the Sun,
appeared like a Cloud, but in the night was very glorious. Thus
<marg><I>The Moon be-
held in the day
time, is like to a
little cloud.</I></marg>
I have by day ob$erved the Moon amid$t certain $mall Clouds,
ju$t as if one of them had been coloured white, but by night it
$hines with much $plendor.</P>
<P>SALV. So that if you had never happened to $ee the Moon,
$ave onely in the day time, you would not have thought it more
$hining than one of tho$e Clouds.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I verily believe I $hould not.</P>
<P>SALV. Tell me now; do you believe that the Moon is really
more $hining in the night than day, or that by $ome accident it
$eemeth $o?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I am of opinion, that it re$plends in it $elf as much in
the day as night, but that its light appears greater by night, be-
cau$e we behold it in the dark mantle of Heaven; and in the day
time, the whole Atmo$phere being very clear, $o that $he little
exceedeth it in lu$tre, $he $eems to us much le$s bright.</P>
<P>SALV. Now tell me; have you ever at midnight $een the Ter-
re$trial Globe illuminated by the Sun?</P>
<P>SIMPL. This $eemeth to me a que$tion not to be ask'd, unle$s
in je$t, or of $ome per$on known to be altogether void of $en$e.</P>
<P>SALV. No, no; I e$teem you to be a very rational man, and
<foot>do</foot>
<p n=>73</p>
do ask the que$tion $eriou$ly; and therefore an$wer me: and if
afterwards you $hall think that I $peak impertinently, I will be
content to be the $en$ele$s man: for he is much more a fool who
interrogates $imply, than he to whom the que$tion is put.</P>
<P>SIMPL. If then you do not think me altogether $imple, take
it for granted that I have an$wered you already, and $aid, that it
is impo$$ible, that one that is upon the Earth, as we are, $hould $ee
by night that part of the Earth where it is day, namely, that is il-
luminated by the Sun.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore you have never $een the Earth enlightned,
$ave onely by day; but you $ee the Moon to $hine al$o in the
dead of night. And this is the cau$e, <I>Simplicius,</I> which makes
you believe that the Earth doth not $hine like the Moon; but if
you could $ee the Earth illuminated, whil$t you were in $ome dark
place, like our night, you would $ee it $hine brighter than the
Moon. Now if you de$ire that the compari$on may proceed
well, you mu$t compare the light of the Earth, with that of the
Moon $een in the day time, and not with the $ame by night: for
it is not in our power to $ee the Earth illuminated, $ave onely in
the day. Is it not $o?</P>
<P>SIMPL. So it ought to be.</P>
<P>SALV. And fora$much as you your $elf have already confe$$ed
to have $een the Moon by day among $ome little white Clouds,
and very nearly, as to its a$pect, re$embling one of them; you did
<marg><I>Clouds are no le$s
apt than the Moon
to be illuminated
by the Sun.</I></marg>
thereby grant, that tho$e Clouds, which yet are Elementary
matters, are as apt to receive illumination, as the Moon, yea
more, if you will but call to mind that you have $ometimes $een
$ome Clouds of va$t greatne$s, and as perfect white as the Snow;
and there is no que$tion, but that if $uch a Cloud could be con-
tinued $o luminous in the deep of night, it would illuminate the
places near about it, more than an hundred Moons. If therefore
we were a$$ured that the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, like one
of tho$e Clouds, it would be undubitable, but that it would be no
le$s $hining than the Moon. But of this there is no que$tion to
be made, in regard we $ee tho$e very Clouds in the ab$ence of
the Sun, to remain by night, as ob$cure as the Earth: and that
which is more, there is not any one of us, but hath $een many
times $ome $uch Clouds low, and far off, and que$tioned whether
they were Clouds or Mountains: an evident $ign that the Moun-
tains are no le$s luminous than tho$e Clouds.</P>
<marg><I>A wall illumina-
ted by the Sun,
compared to the
Moon $hineth no
le$s than it.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. But what needs more di$cour$e? See yonder the Moon
is ri$en, and more than half of it illuminated; $ee there that wall,
on which the Sun $hineth; retire a little this way, $o that you $ee
the Moon $ideways with the wall: look now; which of them
$hews more lucid? Do not you $ee, that if there is any advantage,
<foot>K the</foot>
<p n=>74</p>
the wall hath it? The Sun $hineth on that wall; from thence it
<marg><I>The third re$le-
ction of a Wall illu-
minates more than

Moon.</I></marg>
is reverberated upon the wall of the Hall, from thence it's refle-
cted upon that chamber, $o that it falls on it at the third reflection:
and I am very certain, that there is in that place more light, than
if the Moons light had directly faln upon it.</P>
<P>SIMPL. But this I cannot believe; for the illumination of the
Moon, e$pecially when it is at the full, is very great.</P>
<P>SAGR. It $eemeth great by rea$on of the circumjacent dark
<marg><I>The light of the

places; but ab$olutely it is not much, and is le$s than that of the
twilight half an hour after the Sun is $et; which is manife$t, be-
cau$e you $ee not the $hadows of the bodies illuminated by the
Moon till then, to begin to be di$tingui$hed on the Earth. Whe-
ther, again, that third reflection upon that chamber, illuminates
more than the fir$t of the Moon, may be known by going thether,
and reading a Book, and afterwards $tanding there in the night
by the Moons light, which will $hew by which of them lights one
may read more or le$s plainly, but I believe without further tryal,
that one $hould $ee le$s di$tinctly by this later.</P>
<P>SALV. Now, <I>Simplicius,</I> (if haply you be $atisfied) you may
conceive, as you your $elf know very well, that the Earth doth
$hine no le$s than the Moon; and the only remembring you of $ome
things, which you knew of your $elf, and learn'd not of me, hath
a$$ured you thereof: for I taught you not that the Moon $hews
lighter by night than by day, but you under$tood it of your $elf;
as al$o you could tell me that a little Cloud appeareth as lucid as
the Moon: you knew al$o, that the illumination of the Earth can-
not be $een by night; and in a word, you knew all this, without
knowing that you knew it. So that you have no rea$on to be $cru-
pulous of granting, that the dark part of the Earth may illuminate
the dark part of the Moon, with no le$s a light than that where-
with the Moon illuminates the ob$curities of the night, yea rather
$o much the greater, ina$much as the Earth is forty times bigger
than the Moon.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I mu$t confe$s that I did believe, that that $econdary
light had been the natural light of the Moon.</P>
<P>SALV. And this al$o you know of your $elf, and perceive not
that you know it. Tell me, do not you know without teaching,
that the Moon $hews it $elf more bright by night than by day, in
<marg><I>Luminous bodies
appear the brighter
in an ob$curer</I> am-
bient.</marg>
re$pect of the ob$curity of the $pace of the ambient? and con$e-
quently, do you not know <I>in genere,</I> that every bright body $hews
the clearer, by how much the ambient is ob$curer?</P>
<P>SIMPL. This I know very well.</P>
<P>SALV. When the Moon is horned, and that $econdary light
$eemeth to you very bright, is it not ever nigh the Sun, and con-
$equently, in the light of the <I>crepu$culum,</I> (twilight?)</P>
<foot>SIMPL.</foot>
<p n=>75</p>
<P>SIMPL. It is $o; and I have oftentimes wi$h'd that the Air
would grow thicker, that I might be able to $ee that $ame light
more plainly; but it ever di$appeared before dark night.</P>
<P>SALV. You know then very certainly, that in the depth of
night, that light would be more con$picuous.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I do $o; and al$o more than that, if one could but
take away the great light of the cre$cent illuminated by the Sun,
the pre$ence of which much ob$cureth the other le$$er.</P>
<P>SALV. Why, doth it not $ometimes come to pa$s, that one may
in a very dark night $ee the whole face of the Moon, without be-
ing at all illuminated by the Sun?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I know not whether this ever happeneth, $ave onely
in the total Ecclip$es of the Moon.</P>
<P>SALV. Why, at that time this its light would appear very
clear, being in a mo$t ob$cure <I>medium,</I> and not darkned by the
clarity of the luminous cre$cents: but in that po$ition, how light
did it appear to you?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have $ometimes $een it of the colour of bra$s, and a
little whiti$h; but at other times it hath been $o ob$cure, that I
have wholly lo$t the $ight of it.</P>
<P>SALV. How then can that light be $o natural, which you $ee $o
cleer in the clo$e of the twilight, notwith$tanding the impediment
of the great and contiguous $plendor of the cre$cents; and which
again, in the more ob$cure time of night, all other light removed,
appears not at all?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have heard of $ome that believed that $ame light to
be participated to the$e cre$cents from the other Stars, and in par-
ticular from <I>Venus,</I> the Moons neighbour.</P>
<P>SALV. And this likewi$e is a vanity; becau$e in the time of
its total ob$curation, it ought to appear more $hining than ever;
for you cannot $ay, that the $hadow of the Earth intercepts the
$ight of <I>Venus,</I> or the other Stars. But to $ay true, it is not at
that in$tant wholly deprived thereof, for that the Terre$trial He-
mi$phere, which in that time looketh towards the Moon, is that
where it is night, that is, an intire privation of the light of the Sun.
And if you but diligently ob$erve, you will very $en$ibly perceive,
that like as the Moon, when it is $harp-horned, doth give very little
light to the Earth; and according as in her the parts illumi-
nated by the Suns light do encrea$e: $o likewi$e the $plendor to
our $eeming encrea$eth, which from her is reflected towards us;
thus the Moon, whil$t it is $harp-forked, and that by being between
the Sun and the Earth, it di$covereth a very great part of the Ter-
<marg>*<I>By the Moons two</I>
Quadratures <I>you
are to under$tand
its fir$t and last
quarters, as A-
$trologers call them</I></marg>
re$trial Hemi$phere illuminated, appeareth very clear: and depart-
ing from the Sun, and pa$$ing towards the ^{*}Quadrature, you
may $ee the $aid light by degrees to grow dim; and after the
<foot>K2 Quadra-</foot>
<p n=>76</p>
Quadrature, the $ame appears very weak, becau$e it continually
lo$eth more and more of the view of the luminous part of the
Earth: and yet it $hould $ucceed quite contrary, if that light were
its own, or communicated to it from the Stars; for then we $hould
$ee it in the depth of night, and in $o very dark an ambient.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Stay a little; for I ju$t now remember, that I have
read in a little modern tract, full of many novelties; &ldquo;That this
$econdary light is not derived from the Stars, nor innate in the
Moon, and lea$t of all communicated by the Earth, but that it is
<marg><I>The $econdary
light of the Moon
cau$ed by the Sun,
according to $ome.</I></marg>
received from the $ame illumination of the Sun, which, the $ub-
$tance of the Lunar Globe being $omewhat tran$parent, pene-
trateth thorow all its body; but more livelily illuminateth the
$uperficies of the Hemi$phere expo$ed to the rays of the Sun:
and its pro$undity imbuing, and (as I may $ay) $wallowing that
light, after the manner of a cloud or chry$tal, tran$mits it, and
renders it vi$ibly lucid. And this (if I remember aright) he
proveth by Authority, Experience and Rea$on; citing <I>Cleomedes,
Vitellion, Macrobius,</I> and a certain other modern Author: and
adding, That it is $een by experience to $hine mo$t in the days
neare$t the Conjunction, that is, when it is horned, and is chiefly
bright about its limb. And he farther writes, That in the Solar
Ecclip$es, when it is under the <I>Di$cus</I> of the Sun, it may be $een
tran$lucid, and more e$pecially towards its utmo$t Circle. And
in the next place, for Arguments, as I think, he $aith, That it not
being able to derive that light either from the Earth, or from the
Stars, or from it $elf, it nece$$arily follows, that it cometh from
the Sun. Be$ides that, if you do but grant this $uppo$ition, one
may ea$ily give convenient rea$ons for all the particulars that
occur. For the rea$on why that $ecundary light $hews more
lively towards the outmo$t limb, is, the $hortne$s of the $pace
that the Suns rays hath to penetrate, in regard that of the lines
which pa$s through a circle, the greate$t is that which pa$$eth
through the centre, and of the re$t, tho$e which are farthe$t from
it, are always le$s than tho$e that are nearer. From the $ame
principle, he $aith, may be $hewn why the $aid light doth not
much dimini$h. And la$tly, by this way the cau$e is a$$igned
whence it comes, that that $ame more $hining circle about the
utmo$t edge of the Moon, is $een at the time of the Solar Ec-
clip$e, in that part which lyeth ju$t under the <I>Di$cus</I> of the Sun,
but not in that which is be$ide the <I>Di$cus</I>: which happeneth
becau$e the rays of the Sun pa$s directly to our eye, through the
parts of the Moon underneath: but as for the parts which are
be$ides it, they fall be$ides the eye.&rdquo;</P>

as to have received it for truth; but borrowing it from others, I
cannot find any rea$on $ufficient to excu$e him for not perceiving
its fallacies; and e$pecially after he had heard the true cau$e of
that effect, and had it in his power to $atisfie him$elf by a thou$and
experiments, and manife$t circum$tances, that the $ame proceeded
from the reflection of the Earth, and from nothing el$e: and the more
this $peculation makes $omething to be de$ired, in the judgment of
this Author, and of all tho$e who give no credit to it: $o much the
more doth their not having under$tood and remembred it, excu$e
tho$e more rece$s Antients, who, I am very certain, did they now
under$tand it, would without the lea$t repugnance admit thereof.
And if I may freely tell you what I think, I cannot believe but
that this <I>Modern</I> doth in his heart believe it; but I rather think,
that the conceit he $hould not be the fir$t Author thereof, did a
little move him to endeavour to $uppre$$e it, or to di$parage it at
lea$t among$t the $imple, who$e number we know to be very
great; and many there are, who much more affect the nume-
rous applauds of the people, than the approbation of a few not
vulgar judgments.</P>

$ucceed them in maintaining the number of your fautors; but let
us return to prove to <I>Simplicius</I> the invalidity of the rea$ons of his
modern Author, in which there are $everal fal$ities, incon$equen-
<marg><I>The $econdary
light of the Moon
appears in form of
a Ring, that is to
$ay, bright in the
extreme circumfe-
rence, and not in
the mid$t, and why.</I></marg>
cies, and incredible Paradoxes. And fir$t, it is fal$e that this $e-
condary light is clearer about the utmo$t limb than in the middle
parts, $o as to form, as it were, a ring or circle more bright than
the re$t of its $pace or contence. True it is, indeed, that looking
on the Moon at the time of twilight, at fir$t $ight there is the re-
$emblance of $uch a circle, but by an illu$ion ari$ing from the di-
ver$ity of confines that bound the Moons <I>Di$cus,</I> which are con-
fu$ed by means of this $econdary light; fora$much as on the part
<foot>towards</foot>
<p n=>78</p>
towards the Sun it is bounded by the lucid horns of the Moon,
and on the other part, its confining term is the ob$cure tract of the
twilight; who$e relation makes us think the candor of the Moons
<I>Di$cus</I> to be $o much the clearer; the which happens to be ob-
fu$cated in the oppo$ite part, by the greater clarity of the cre$-
cents; but if this modern Author had e$$aied to make an inter-

po$ition between the eye and the primary $plendor, by the ridg of
$ome hou$e, or $ome other $creen, $o as to have left vi$ible only
the gro$e of the Moon, the horns excluded, he might have $een
it all alike luminous.</P>
<P>SIMPL, I think, now I remember, that he writes of his
making u$e of $uch another Artifice, to hide from us the fal$e
<I>Incidum.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Oh! how is this (as I believed) inadvertency of his,
changed into a lie, bordering on ra$hne$$e; for that every one
may frequently make proof of the contrary. That in the next
<marg><I>The Moons</I> Dif-
cus <I>in a $olar E-
clip$e can be $een
onely by privation.</I></marg>
place, at the Suns Eclip$e, the Moons <I>Di$cus</I> is $een otherwayes
than by privation, I much doubt, and $pecially when the E-
clip$e is not total, as tho$e mu$t nece$$arily have been, which
were ob$erved by the Author; but if al$o he $hould have di$cove-
red $omewhat of light, this contradicts not, rather favoureth our
opinion; for that at $uch a time, the whole Terre$trial Hemi-
$phere illuminated by the Sun, is oppo$ite to the Moon, $o that
although the Moons $hadow doth ob$cure a part thereof, yet this
is very $mall in compari$on of that which remains illuminated.
That which he farther adds, that in this ca$e, the part of the
limb, lying under the Sun, doth appear very lucid, but that
which lyeth be$ides it, not $o; and that to proceed from the co-
ming of the $olar rayes directly through that part to the eye, but
not through this, is really one of tho$e fopperies, which di$co
ver the other fictions, of him which relates them: For if it be
requi$ite to the making a $econdary light vi$ible in the lunar <I>Di$-
cus,</I> that the rayes of the Sun came directly through it to our
eyes, doth not this pitiful Philo$opher perceive, that we $hould ne-
ver $ee this $ame $econdary light, $ave onely at the Eclip$e of the
Sun? And if a part onely of the Moon, far le$$e than half a de-
gree, by being remote from the Suns <I>Di$cus,</I> can deflect or de-
viate the rayes of the Sun, $o that they arrive not at our eye;
what $hall it do when it is di$tant twenty or thirty degrees, as it is
at its fir$t apparition? and what cour$e $hall the rayes of the Sun
keep, which are to pa$$e thorow the body of the Moon, that
<marg><I>The Author of the
Book of conclu$i-
ons, accommodates
the things to his
purpo$es, and not
his purpo$es to the
things.</I></marg>
they may find out our eye? This man doth go $ucce$$ively con$i-
dering what things ought to be, that they may $erve his purpo$e,
but doth not gradually proceed, accommodating his conceits to
the things, as really they are. As for in$tance, to make the light
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>79</p>
of the Sun capable to penetrate the $ub$tance of the Moon, he
makes her in part diaphanous, as is <I>v. g.</I> the tran$parence of a cloud,
or cry$tal: but I know not what he would think of $uch a tran-
$parency, in ca$e the $olar rayes were to pa$$e a depth of clouds
of above two thou$and miles; but let it be $uppo$ed that he
$hould boldly an$wer, that might well be in the C&oelig;le$tial, which
are quite other things from the$e our Elementary, impure, and
feculent bodies; and let us convict his error by $uch wayes, as
admit him no reply, or (to $ay better) $ubter-fuge. If he will
maintain, that the $ub$tance of the Moon is diaphanous, he
mu$t $ay that it is $o, while$t that the rayes of the Sun are to pe-
netrate its whole profundity, that is, more than two thou$and
miles; but that if you oppo$e unto them onely one mile, or
le$$e, they $hould no more penetrate that, than they penetrate
one of our mountains.</P>
<P>SAGR. You put me in mind of a man, who would have $old
<marg><I>A je$t put upon one
that would $ell a
certain $ecret for
holding corre$pon-
dency with a per$on
a thou$and miles
off</I></marg>
me a $ecret how to corre$pond, by means of a certain $ympathy of
magnetick needles, with one, that $hould be two or three thou-
$and miles di$tant; and I telling him, that I would willingly buy
the $ame, but that I de$ired fir$t to $ee the experiment thereof,
and that it did $uffice me to make it, I being in one Chamber, and
he in the next, he an$wered me, that in $o $mall a di$tance one
could not $o well perceive the operation; whereupon I turn'd him
going, telling him, that I had no mind, at that time, to take a
journey unto <I>Grand Cairo,</I> or to <I>Mu$covy,</I> to make the experi-
ment; but that, if he would go him$elf, I would perform the
other part, $taying in <I>Venice.</I> But let us hear whither the dedu-
ction of our Author tendeth, and what nece$$ity there is, that he
mu$t grant the matter of the Moon to be mo$t perforable by the
rayes of the Sun, in a depth of two thou$and miles, but more
opacous than one of our mountains, in a thickne$$e of one mile
onely.</P>
<P>SALV. The very mountains of the Moon them$elves are a
proof thereof, which percu$$ed on one $ide of the Sun, do ca$t
on the contrary $ide very dark $hadows, terminate, and more di-
$tinct by much, than the $hadows of ours; but had the$e moun-
tains been diaphanous, we could never have come to the know-
ledg of any unevenne$$e in the $uperficies of the Moon, nor have
$een tho$e luminous montuo$ities di$tingui$hed by the terms which
$eparate the lucid parts from the dark: much le$$e, $hould we $ee
this $ame term $o di$tinct, if it were true, that the Suns light did
penetrate the whole thickne$$e of the Moon; yea rather, accord-
ing to the Authors own words, we $hould of nece$$ity di$cern the
pa$$age, and confine, between the part of the Sun $een, and the
part not $een, to be very confu$ed, and mixt with light and
<foot>dark-</foot>
<p n=>80</p>
darkne$$e; for that that matter which admits the pa$$age of the
Suns rayes thorow a $pace of two thou$and miles, mu$t needs be
$o tran$parent, that it would very weakly re$i$t them in a hun-
dredth, or le$$er part of that thickne$$e; neverthele$$e, the term
which $eparateth the part illuminated from the ob$cure, is inci-
dent, and as di$tinct, as white is di$tinct from black; and e-
$pecially where the Section pa$$eth through the part of the Moon,
that is naturally more clear and montanous; but where the old
$pots do part, which are certain plains, that by means of their
$pherical inclination, receive the rayes of the Sun obliquely,
there the term is not $o di$tinct, by rea$on of the more dimme il-
lumination. That, la$tly, which he $aith, how that the $econdary
light doth not dimini$h and langui$h, according as the Moon en-
crea$eth, but con$erveth it $elf continually in the $ame efficacy;
is mo$t fal$e; nay it is hardly $een in the quadrature, when, on
the contrary, it $hould appear more $plendid, and be vi$ible after
the <I>crepu$culum</I> in the dark of night. Let us conclude therefore,
that the Earths reflection is very $trong upon the Moon; and that,
which you ought more to e$teem, we may deduce from thence an-
other admirable congruity between the Moon and Earth; name-
<marg><I>The Earth may re-
ciprocally operate
upon C&oelig;le$tial bo-
dies, with its light.</I></marg>
ly, that if it be true, the Planets operate upon the Earth by their
motion and light, the Earth may probably be no le$$e potent in
operating reciprocally upon them with the $ame light, and perad-
venture, motion al$o. And though it $hould not move, yet may
it retain the $ame operation; becau$e, as it hath been proved al-
ready, the action of the light is the $elf $ame, I mean of the light
of the Sun reflected; and motion doth nothing, $ave only vary
the a$pects, which fall out in the $ame manner, whether we make
the Earth move, and the Sun $tand $till, or the contrary.</P>
<P>SIMPL. None of the Philo$ophers are found to have $aid, that
the$e inferiour bodies operate on the C&oelig;le$tial, nay, <I>Ari$totle</I> af-
firmes the direct contrary.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Aristotle</I> and the re$t, who knew not that the Earth and
Moon mutually illuminated each other, are to be excu$ed; but
they would ju$tly de$erve our cen$ure, if while$t they de$ire that
we $hould grant and believe with them, that the Moon operateth
upon the Earth with light, they $hould deny to us, who have
taught them that the Earth illuminates the Moon, the operation
the Earth hath on the Moon.</P>
<P>SIMPL. In $hort, I find in my $elf a great unwillingne$$e to
admit this commerce, which you would per$wade me to be be-
twixt the Earth and Moon, placing it, as we $ay, among$t the
number of the Stars; for if there were nothing el$e, the great
$eparation and di$tance between it and the C&oelig;le$tial bodies, doth
in my opinion nece$$arily conclude a va$t di$parity between them.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>81</p>
<P>SALV. See <I>Simplicius</I> what an inveterate affection and radica-
ted opinion can do, $ince it is $o powerful, that it makes you think
that tho$e very things favour you, which you produce again$t
your $elf. For if $eparation and di$tance are accidents $ufficient to
per$wade with you a great diver$ity of natures, it mn$t follow that
<marg><I>Affinity between
he Earth &amp; Moon
in re$pect of their
vicinity.</I></marg>
proximity and contiguity import $imilitude. Now how much more
neerer is the Moon to the Earth, than to any other of the C&oelig;le$tial
Orbs? You mu$t acknowledg therefore, according to your own con-
ce$$ion (and you $hall have other Philo$ophers bear you company)
that there is a very great affinity betwixt the Earth and Moon.
Now let us proceed, and $ee whether any thing remains to be con-
$idered, touching tho$e objections which you made again$t the re-
$emblances that are between the$e two bodies.</P>
<P>SIMPL. It re$ts, that we $ay $omething touching the $olidity of
the Moon, which I argued from its being exqui$ite $mooth and
polite, and you from its montuo$ity. There is another $cruple al-
$o comes into my mind, from an opinion which I have, that the
Seas reflection ought by the equality of its $urface, to be rendered
$tronger than that of the Earth, who$e $uperficies is $o rough and
opacous.</P>
<P>SALV. As to the fir$t objection; I $ay, that like as among the
parts of the Earth, which all by their gravity $trive to approach the
<marg><I>Solidity of the
Lunar Globe argu-
ed from its being
montainous.</I></marg>
neare$t they can po$$ible to the center, $ome of them alwayes are
more remote from it than the re$t, as the mountains more than
the valleys, and that by rea$on of their $olidity and firmne$$e
(for if they were of fluid, they would be even) $o the $eeing $ome
parts of the Moon to be elevated above the $phericity of the low-
er parts, argueth their hardne$$e; for it is probable that the mat-
ter of the Moon is reduced into a $pherical form by the harmoni-
ous con$piration of all its parts to the $ame $enten$e. Touching
the $econd doubt, my thinks that the particulars already ob$erved
to happen in the Looking-gla$$es, may very well a$$ure us, that the
reflection of light comming from the Sea, is far weaker than that
<marg><I>The Seas refle-
ction of light much
weaker than that
of the Earth.</I></marg>
which cometh from Land; under$tanding it alwayes of the
univer$al reflection; for as to that particular, on which the wa-
ter being calm, ca$teth upon a determinate place, there is no
doubt, but that he who $hall $tand in that place, $hall $ee a very
great reflection in the water, but every way el$e he $hall $ee the
$urface of the Water more ob$cure than that of the Land; and to
<marg><I>An experiment
to prove the refle-
ction of the Water
le$$e clear than
that of the Land.</I></marg>
prove it to your $en$es, let us go into yonder Hall, and power
forth a little water upon the Pavement. Tell me now, doth not
this wet brick $hew more dull than the other dry ones? Doubt-
le$$e it doth, and will $o appear, from what place $oever you be-
hold it, except one onely, and this is that way which the light
cometh, that entereth in at yonder window; go backwards
therefore by a little and a little.</P>
<foot>L SIMPL.</foot>
<p n=>82</p>
<P>SIMPL. Here I $ee the we$t part $hine more than all the re$t of
the pavement, and I $ee that it $o hapneth, becau$e the refle-
ction of the light which entereth in at the window, cometh to-
wards me.</P>
<P>SALV. That moi$ture hath done no more but filled tho$e little
cavities which are in the brick with water, and reduced its $uper-
ficies to an exact evene$$e; whereupon the reflex rayes i$$ue
unitedly towards one and the $ame place; but the re$t of the
pavement which is dry, hath its protuberances, that is, an innu-
merable variety of inclinations in its $malle$t particles; whereup-
on the reflections of the light $catter towards all parts, but more
weakly than if they had gone all united together; and therefore,
the $ame $heweth almo$t all alike, beheld $everal wayes, but far
le$$e clear than the moi$tned brick. I conclude therefore, that the
$urface of the Sea, beheld from the Moon, in like manner, as it
would appear mo$t equal, (the I$lands and Rocks deducted) $o it
would $hew le$$e clear than that of the Earth, which is montanous
and uneven. And but that I would not $eem, as the $aying is,
to harp too much on one $tring, I could tell you that I have ob-
$erved in the Moon that $econdary light which I told you came to
her from the reflection of the Terre$trial Globe, to be notably
<marg><I>The $econdary
light of the Moon
clearer before the
conjunction, than
after.</I></marg>
more clear two or three dayes before the conjunction, than after,
that is, when we $ee it before break of day in the Ea$t, than
when it is $een at night after Sun-$et in the We$t; of which dif-
ference the cau$e is, that the Terre$trial Hemi$phere, which looks
towards the Ea$tern Moon, hath little Sea, and much Land, to
wit, all <I>A$ia,</I> whereas, when it is in the We$t, it beholds very
great Seas, that is, the whole <I>Atlantick</I> Ocean as far as <I>America:</I>
An Argument $ufficiently probable that the $urface of the water
appears le$$e $plendid than that of the Earth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. So that perhaps you believe, tho$e great $pots di$co-
vered in the face of the Moon, to be Seas, and the other clearer
parts to be Land, or $ome $uch thing?</P>
<P>SALV. This which you ask me, is the beginning of tho$e in-
congruities which I e$teem to be between the Moon and the
Earth, out of which it is time to di$-ingage our $elves, for we
have $tayed too long in the Moon. I $ay therefore, that if there
were in nature but one way onely, to make two $uperficies illu$tra-
ted by the Sun, to appear one more clear than the other, and
that this were by the being of the one Earth, and the other Wa-
ter; it would be nece$$ary to $ay that the $urface of the Moon
were part earthy and part aquatick; but becau$e we know many
wayes to produce the $ame effect (and others there may be which
we know not of;) therefore I dare not affirm the Moon to con-
$i$t of one thing more than another: It hath been $een already
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>83</p>
that a $ilver plate boiled, being toucht with the Burni$her, be-
cometh of white ob$cure; that the moi$t part of the Earth $hews
more ob$cure than the dry; that in the tops of Hills, the woody
parts appear more gloomy than the naked and barren; which
hapneth becau$e there falleth very much $hadow among the Trees,
but the open places are illuminated all over by the Sun. And this
mixtion of $hadow hath $uch operation, that in tu$ted velvet, the
$ilk which is cut, is of a far darker colour than that which is not
cut, by means of the $hadows diffu$ed betwixt thred and thred,
and a plain velvet $hews much blacker than a Taffata, made of the
$ame $ilk. So that if there were in the Moon things which $hould
look like great Woods, their a$pect might repre$ent unto us the
$pots which we di$cover; alike difference would be occa$ioned, if
there were Seas in her: and la$tly, nothing hindreth, but that tho$e
$pots may really be of an ob$curer colour than the re$t; for thus
the $now makes the mountains $hew brighter. That which is plain-
<marg><I>The ob$curer
parts of the Moon
are plains, and the
more bright moun-
tainous.</I></marg>
ly ob$erved in the Moon is, that its mo$t ob$cure parts are all
plains, with few ri$es and bancks in them; though $ome there be;
the re$t which is of a brighter colour, is all full of rocks, moun-
tains, hillocks of $pherical and other figures; and in particular, round
about the $pots are very great ledges of mountains. That the
<marg><I>Long ledges of
mountaixs about
the $pots of the
Moon.</I></marg>
$pots be plain $uperficies, we have a$$uredproof, in that we $ee,
how that the term which di$tingui$heth the part illuminated from
the ob$cure, in cro$$ing the $pots makes the inter$ection even, but
in the clear parts it $hews all craggy and $hagged. But I know not
as yet whether this evenne$$e of $uperficies may be $ufficient of it
$elf alone, to make the ob$curity appear, and I rather think not.
Be$ides, I account the Moon exceeding different from the Earth;
for although I imagine to my $elf that tho$e are not idle and dead
Regions, yet I affirm not, that there are in them motion and life,
<marg><I>There are not
generated in the
Moon things like
to ours, but if
there be any pro-
ductions, they are
very different.</I></marg>
much le$s that there are bred plants, animals or other things like
to ours; but, if $uch there be, they $hould neverthele$s be very
different, and remote from our imagination. And I am induced $o
to think, becau$e in the fir$t place, I e$teem that the matter of the
Lunar Globe con$i$ts not of Earth and Water; and this alone
$ufficeth to take away the generations and alterations re$embling
ours: but now $uppo$ing that there were in the Moon, Water and
<marg><I>The Moon <*>os
compo$ed of Water
and Earth.</I></marg>
Earth, yet would they not produce plants and animals like to
ours; and this for two principal rea$ons: The fir$t is, that unto our
<marg><I>Tho$e a$pects of
the Sun nece$$ary
for our generati-
ons, are not $o in
the Moon.</I></marg>
productions there are required $o many variable a$pects of the Sun,
that without them they would all mi$carry: now the habitudes of
the Sun towards the Earth are far different from tho$e towards
the Moon. We as to the diurnal illumination, have, in the greater
part of the Earth, every twenty four hours part day, and part
night, which effect in the Moon is monethly: and that annual decli-
<foot>L2 nation</foot>
<p n=>84</p>
nation and elevation of the Sun in the Zodiack, by which it pro-
<marg><I>Natural dayas
in the Moon are of
a Moneth long.</I></marg>
duceth diver$ity of Sea$ons, and inequality of dayes and nights,
are fini$hed in the Moon in a moneth; and whereas the Sun to us
<marg><I>To the Moon
the Sun a$eondeth
and declineth with
a difference of ten
degrees, and to the
Earth of forty $e-
ven degrees.</I></marg>
ri$eth and declineth $o much, that from the greate$t to the lea$t al-
titude, there is a difference of almo$t 47 degrees, for $o much is
the di$tance from one to the other Tropick; this is in the Moon
but ten degrees only, or little more; namely, as much as the grea-
te$t Latitudes of the Dragon on each $ide the Ecliptick. Now
con$ider what effect the Sun would have in the torrid Zone, $hould
it continually for fifteen dayes together beam forth its Rayes upon
it; which without all que$tion would de$troy plants, herbs,
and living creatures: and if it $hould chance that there were any
production, it would be of herbs, plants, and creatures very diffe-
<marg><I>There are no
rains in the Moon.</I></marg>
rent from tho$e which are now there. Secondly, I verily believe
that in the Moon there are no rains, for if Clouds $hould gather
in any part thereof, as they do about the Earth, they would there-
upon hide from our $ight $ome of tho$e things, which we with the
<I>Tele$cope</I> behold in the Moon, and in a word, would $ome way or
other change its <I>Ph&oelig;nomenon,</I> an effect which I could never by long
and diligent ob$ervations di$cover; but alwayes beheld it in a
even and pure $erenity.</P>
<P>SAGR. To this may be an$wered, either that there might be
great mi$ts, or that it might rain in the time of their night, that is,
when the Sun doth not illuminate it.</P>
<P>SALV. If other pa$$ages did but a$$ure us, that there were ge-
nerations in it like to ours, and that there was onely wanting the
concour$e of rains, we might find out this, or $ome other tempe-
rament to $erve in$tead thereof, as it happens in <I>Egypt</I> by the in-
undation of <I>Nile:</I> but not meeting with any accident, which cor-
re$ponds with ours, of many that have been $ought out for the pro-
duction of the like effects, we need not trouble our $elves to intro-
duce one alone; and that al$o, not becau$e we have certain ob$er-
vation of it, but for a bare non-repugnance that we find therein.
Moreover, if I was demanded what my fir$t apprehen$ion, and pure
natural rea$on dictated to me concerning the production of things
like or unlike there above, I would alwayes reply, that they are
mo$t different, and to us altogether unimaginable, for $o me thinks
the riches of Nature, and the omnipotence of our Creator and
Governour, do require.</P>
<P>SAGR. I ever accounted extraordinary madne$$e that of tho$e,
who would make humane comprehen$ion the mea$ure of what na-
ture hath a power or knowledge to effect; whereas on the con-
<marg><I>The having a
perfect knowledg
of nothing, maketh
$ome believe they
under$tand all
things.</I></marg>
trary there is not any the lea$t effect in Nature, which can be fully
under$tood by the mo$t $peculative wits in the world. This their
$o vain pre$umption of knowing all, can take beginning from no-
<foot>thing</foot>

thing, unle$$e from their never having known any thing; for if
one hath but once onely experienced the perfect knowledg of one
onely thing, and but truly ta$ted what it is to know, he $hall per-
ceive that of infinite other conclu$ions, he under$tands not $o much
as one.</P>
<P>SALV. Your di$cour$e is very concluding; in confirmation of
which we have the example of tho$e who under$tand, or have
known $ome thing, which the more knowing they are, the more
they know, and freely confe$$e that they know little; nay, the
wi$e$t man in all <I>Greece,</I> and for $uch pronounced by the Oracle,
openly profe$$ed to know that he knew nothing.</P>
<P>SIMPL. It mu$t be granted therefore, either that <I>Socrates</I> or
that the <I>Oracle</I> it $elf was a lyar, <I>that declaring him to be mo$t
wi$e, and he confe$$ing that he knew him$elf to be mo$t ig-
norant.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Neither one nor the other doth follow, for that both
<marg><I>The an$wer of
the Oracle true in
judging</I> Socrates
<I>the wi$eft of his
time.</I></marg>
the a$$ertions may be true. The <I>Oracle</I> adjudged <I>Socrates</I> the wi-
$e$t of all men, who$e knowledg is limited; <I>Socrates</I> acknow-
ledgeth that he knew nothing in relation to ab$olute wi$dome,
which is infinite; and becau$e of infinite, much is the $ame part,
as is little, and as is nothing (for to arrive <I>v. g.</I> to the infinite
number, it is all one to accumulate thou$ands, tens, or ciphers,)
therefore <I>Socrates</I> well perceived his wi$dom to be nothing, in
compari$on of the infinite knowledg which he wanted. But yet,
becau$e there is $ome knowledg found among$t men, and this
not equally $hared to all, <I>Socrates</I> might have a greater $hare
thereof than others, and therefore verified the an$wer of the
<I>Oracle.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. I think I very well under$tand this particular among$t
men, <I>Simplicius</I> there is a power of operating, but not equally
di$pen$ed to all; and it is without que$tion, that the power of an
Emperor is far greater than that of a private per$on; but, both
this and that are nothing in compari$on of the Divine Omnipo-
tence. Among$t men, there are $ome that better under$tand
Agriculture than many others; but the knowledg of planting a
Vine in a trench, what hath it to do with the knowledg of ma-
king it to $prout forth, to attract nouri$hment, to $elect this good
part from that other, for to make thereof leaves, another to make
$prouts, another to make grapes, another to make rai$ins, ano-
ther to make the huskes of them, which are the works of mo$t
wi$e Nature? This is one only particular act of the innumerable,
which Nature doth, and in it alone is di$covered an infinite wi$-
<marg><I>Divine Wi$dom

dom, $o that Divine Wi$dom may be concluded to be infinitely
infinite.</P>
<P>SALV. Take hereof another example. Do we not $ay that the
<foot>judi-</foot>
<p n=>86</p>
judicious di$covering of a mo$t lovely <I>Statua</I> in a piece of Marble,
<marg>Buonarruotti, <I>a
$tatuary of admi-
rable ingenuity.</I></marg>
hath $ublimated the wit of <I>Buonarruotti</I> far above the vulgar wits
of other men? And yet this work is onely the imitation of a
meer aptitude and di$po$ition of exteriour and $uperficial mem-
bers of an immoveable man; but what is it in compari$on of a
man made by nature, compo$ed of as many exteriour and inte-
riour members, of $o many mu$cles, tendons, nerves, bones,
which $erve to $o many and $undry motions? but what $hall we
$ay of the $en$es, and of the powers of the $oul, and la$tly, of
the under$tanding? May we not $ay, and that with rea$on, that
the $tructure of a Statue fals far $hort of the formation of a living
man, yea more of a contemptible worm?</P>
<P>SAGR. And what difference think you, was there betwixt the
Dove of <I>Architas,</I> and one made by Nature?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Either I am none of the$e knowing men, or el$e
there is a manife$t contradiction in this your di$cour$e. You ac-
count under$tanding among$t the greate$t (if you make it not the
chief of the) <I>Encomiums</I> a$cribed to man made by Nature, and
a little before you $aid with <I>Socrates,</I> that he had no knowledg at
all; therefore you mu$t $ay, that neither did Nature under$tand
how to make an under$tanding that under$tandeth.</P>
<P>SALV. You argue very cunningly, but to reply to your obje-
ction I mu$t have recour$e to a Philo$ophical di$tinction, and $ay
that the under$tanding is to be taken too ways, that is <I>inten$iv&egrave;,</I> or
<marg><I>Man under$tand-
eth very well</I> in-
ten$iv&egrave;, <I>but little</I>
exten$iv&egrave;.</marg>
<I>exten$iv&egrave;</I>; and that <I>exten$ive,</I> that is, as to the multitude of intel-
ligibles, which are infinite, the under$tanding of man is as no-
thing, though he $hould under$tand a thou$and propo$itions; for
that a thou$and, in re$pect of infinity is but as a cypher: but taking
the under$tanding <I>inten$ive,</I> (in as much as that term imports) in-
ten$ively, that is, perfectly $ome propo$itions, I $ay, that humane wi$-
dom under$tandeth $ome propo$itions $o perfectly, and is as ab$o-
lutely certain thereof, as Nature her $elf; and $uch are the pure
Mathematical $ciences, to wit, Geometry and Arithmetick: in which
Divine Wi$dom knows infinite more propo$itions, becau$e it knows
them all; but I believe that the knowledge of tho$e few compre-
hended by humane under$tanding, equalleth the divine, as to the
certainty <I>objectiv&egrave;,</I> for that it arriveth to comprehend the nece$-
$ity thereof, than which there can be no greater certainty.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This $eemeth to me a very bold and ra$h expre$$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. The$e are common notions, and far from all umbrage
of temerity, or boldne$s, and detract not in the lea$t from the Ma-
je$ty of divine wi$dom; as it nothing dimini$heth the omnipotence
thereof to $ay, that God cannot make what is once done, to be un-
done: but I doubt, <I>Simplicius,</I> that your $cruple ari$eth from an o-
pinion you have, that my words are $omewhat equivocal; there-
<foot>fore</foot>
<p n=>87</p>
fore the better to expre$s my $elf I $ay, that as to the truth, of
which Mathematical demon$trations give us the knowledge, it is
the $ame, which the divine wi$dom knoweth; but this I mu$t grant
you, that the manner whereby God knoweth the infinite propo-
<marg><I>Gods manner of
knowing different
from that of men.</I></marg>
$itions, of which we under$tand $ome few, is highly more excellent
than ours, which proceedeth by ratiocination, and pa$$eth from con-
<marg><I>Humane under-
$tanding done by
raciocination.</I></marg>
clu$ion to conclu$ion, whereas his is done at one $ingle thought or
intuition; and whereas we, for example, to attain the knowledg
of $ome pa$$ion of the Circle, which hath infinite, beginning
from one of the mo$t $imple, and taking that for its definition,
do proceed with argumentation to another, and from that to a
third, and then to a fourth, <I>&amp;c.</I> the Divine Wi$dom, by the
apprehen$ion of its e$$ence comprehends, without temporary raci-
ocination, all the$e infinite pa$$ions; which notwith$tanding, are
in effect virtually compri$ed in the definitions of all things; and, to
<marg><I>Definitions con-
tein virtually all
the pa$$ions of the
things defined.</I></marg>
conclude, as being infinite, perhaps are but one alone in their nature,
and in the Divine Mind; the which neither is wholly unknown to
humane under$tanding, but onely be-clouded with thick and
<marg><I>Infinite Pa$$ions
are perhaps but
one onely.</I></marg>
gro$$e mi$ts; which come in part to be di$$ipated and clarified,
when we are made Ma$ters of any conclu$ions, firmly demon-
$trated, and $o perfectly made ours, as that we can $peedily run
through them; for in $um, what other, is that propo$ition, that
the $quare of the $ide $ubtending the right angle in any triangle,
is equal to the $quares of the other two, which include it, but
onely the Paralellograms being upon common ba$es, and between
parallels equal among$t them$elves? and this, la$tly, is it not the
$ame, as to $ay that tho$e two $uperficies are equal, of which
equal parts applyed to equal parts, po$$e$$e equal place? Now
<marg><I>The di$cour$es
which humane
rea$on makes in a
certain time, the
Divine Wi$dom re-
$olveth in a mo-
ment; that is, hath
them alwayes pre-

the$e inferences, which our intellect apprehendeth with time and a
gradual motion, the Divine Wi$dom, like light, penetrateth in
an in$tant, which is the $ame as to $ay, hath them alwayes pre-
$ent: I conclude therefore, that our under$tanding, both as to
the manner and the multitude of the things comprehended by us,
is infinitely $urpa$t by the Divine Wi$dom; but yet I do not $o
vilifie it, as to repute it ab$olutely nothing; yea rather, when I
con$ider how many and how great mi$teries men have under$tood,
di$covered, and contrived, I very plainly know and under$tand
the mind of man to be one of the works, yea one of the mo$t ex-
cellent works of God.</P>

of that which you $peak of, how great the wit of man is; and
whil'$t I run thorow $uch and $o many admirable inventions found
out by him, as well in the Arts, as Sciences; and again reflecting
upon my own wit, $o far from promi$ing me the di$covery of any
thing new, that I de$pair of comprehending what is already di$-

<p n=>88</p>
covered, confounded with wonder, and $urpri$ed with de$pera-

thou know how to chizzle away the refu$e of a piece of Marble,
and di$cover $o lovely a figure, as lyeth hid therein? When wilt
thou mix and $pread $o many different colours upon a Cloth, or
Wall, and repre$ent therewith all vi$ible objects, like a <I>Michael

light to the ear: When $hall I cea$e my a$toni$hment? What
$hall I $ay of $uch and $o various In$truments of that Art? The

<P>SALV. The ye$ter-dayes diver$ions which led us
out of the path of our principal di$cour$e,
were $uch and $o many, that I know not
how I can without your a$$i$tance reco-
ver the track in which I am to proceed.</P>
<P>SAGR. I wonder not, that you, who
have your fancy charged and laden with
both what hath been, and is to be $po-
ken, do find your $elf in $ome confu$i-
on; but I, who as being onely an Auditor, have nothing to bur-
then my memory withal, but $uch things as I have heard, may
happily by a $uccinct rehear$al of them, recover the fir$t thred
of our Di$cour$e. As far therefore as my memory $erves me, the
$um of ye$terdayes conferences were an examination of the Prin-
<foot>M ciples</foot>
<p n=>90</p>
ciples of <I>Ptolomy</I> and <I>Copernicus,</I> and which of their opinions is
the more probable and rational; that, which affirmeth the $ub-
$tance of the C&oelig;le$tial bodies to be ingenerable, incorruptible, un-
alterable, impa$$ible, and in a word, exempt from all kind of change,
$ave that of local, and therefore to be a <I>fifth e$$ence,</I> quite different
from this of our Elementary bodies, which are generable, corrup-
tible, alterable, <I>&amp;c.</I> or el$e the other, which taking away $uch
deformity from the parts of the World, holdeth the Earth to en-
joy the $ame perfections as the other integral bodies of the uni-
ver$e; and e$teemeth it a moveable and erratick Globe, no le$$e
than the Moon, <I>Jupiter, Venus,</I> or any other Planet: And la$tly,
maketh many particular parallels betwixt the Earth and Moon;
and more with the Moon, than with any other Planet; hap-
ly by rea$on we have greater and more certain notice of it, as
being le$$e di$tant from us. And having, la$tly, concluded this
$econd opinion to have more of probability with it than the fir$t,
I $hould think it be$t in the $ub$equent di$cour$es to begin to exa-
mine whether the Earth be e$teemed immoveable, as it hath
been till now believed by mo$t men, or el$e moveable, as $ome
ancient <I>Philo$ophers</I> held, and others of not very rece$$e times,
were of opinion; and if it be moveable, to enquire of what
kind its motion may be?</P>
<P>SALV. I $ee already what way I am to take; but before we
offer to proceed any farther, I am to $ay $omething to you touch-
ing tho$e la$t words which you $pake, how that the opinion which
holds the Earth to be endued with the $ame conditions that the
C&oelig;le$tial bodies enjoy, $eems to be more true than the contra-
ry; for that I affirmed no $uch thing, nor would I have any of the
Propo$itions in controver$ie, be made to $peak to any definitive
$en$e: but I onely intended to produce on either part, tho$e rea-
$ons and an$wers, arguments and $olutions, which have been hi-
therto thought upon by others, together with certain others,
which I have $tumbled upon in my long $earching thereinto, al-
wayes remitting the deci$ion thereof to the judgment of others.</P>
<P>SAGR. I was unawares tran$ported by my own $en$e of the
thing; and believing that others ought to judg as I did, I made
that conclu$ion univer$al, which $hould have been particular; and
therefore confe$$e I have erred, and the rather, in that I know
not what <I>Simplicius</I> his judgment is in this particular.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I mu$t confe$$e, that I have been ruminating all this
night of what pa$t ye$terday, and to $ay the truth, I meet there-
in with many acute, new, aud plau$ible notions; yet neverthele$s,
I find my $elf over-per$waded by the authority of $o many great
<I>Writers,</I> and in particular ------- <I>&amp;c.</I> I $ee you $hake your
head <I>Sagredus,</I> and $mile to your $elf, as if I had uttered $ome
great ab$urdity.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>91</p>
<P>SAGR. I not onely $mile, but to tell you true, am ready to
bur$t with holding in my $elf from laughing outright, for you
have put me in mind of a very pretty pa$$age, that I was a wit-
ne$$e of, not many years $ince, together with $ome others of
my worthy friends, which I could yet name unto you.</P>
<P>SALV. It would be well that you told us what it was, that $o
<I>Simplicius</I> may not $till think that he gave you the occa$ion of
laughter.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am content. I found one day, at home in his hou$e, at
<I>Venice,</I> a famous Phi$ician, to whom $ome flockt for their $tudies,
and others out of curio$ity, $ometimes came thither to $ee certain A-
natomies di$$ected by the hand of a no le$$e learned, than careful
and experienced Anatomi$t. It chanced upon that day, when I was
<marg><I>The original of
the Nerv s. ac-
cording to</I> Ari$to-
tle, <I>and according
to Phi$icians.</I></marg>
there, that he was in $earch of the original and ri$e of the Nerves,
about which there is a famous controver$ie between the <I>Galeni$ts</I>
and <I>Peripateticks</I>; and the Anatomi$t $hewing, how that the great
number of Nerves departing from the Brain, as their root, and
pa$$ing by the nape of the Neck, di$tend them$elves afterwards
along by the Back-bone, and branch them$elves thorow all the
Body; and that a very $mall filament, as fine as a thred went to
the Heart; he turned to a Gentleman whom he knew to be a <I>Pe-
ripatetick</I> Philo$opher, and for who$e $ake he had with extraor-
dinary exactne$$e, di$covered and proved every thing, and demand-
ed of him, if he was at length $atisfied and per$waded that the origi-
nal of the Nerves proceeded from the Brain, and not from the
Heart? To which the Philo$opher, after he had $tood mu$ing a
<marg><I>The ridiculus
an$wer of a Philo-
$opher, determi-
ning the original of
the Nerves.</I></marg>
while, an$wered; you have made me to $ee this bu$ine$$e $o
plainly and $en$ibly, that did not the <I>Text</I> of <I>Ari$totle</I> a$$ert the
contrary, which po$itively affirmeth the Nerves to proceed from
the Heart, I $hould be con$trained to confe$$e your opinion to be
true.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I would have you know my Ma$ters, that this contro-
ver$ie about the original of the Nerves is not yet $o proved and
decided, as $ome may perhaps per$wade them$elves.</P>
<P>SAGR. Nor que$tionle$$e ever $hall it be, if it find $uch like
contradictors; but that which you $ay, doth not at all le$$en the
extravagance of the an$wer of that <I>Peripatetick,</I> who again$t
$uch $en$ible experience produced not other experiments, or rea-
$ons of <I>Ari$totle,</I> but his bare authority and pure <I>ip$e dixit.</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. <I>Ari$totle</I> had not gained $o great authority, but for
the force of his Demon$trations, and the profoundne$$e of his
arguments; but it is requi$ite that we under$tand him, and not
onely under$tand him, but have $o great familiarity with his
Books, that we form a perfect <I>Idea</I> thereof in our minds, $o as
that every $aying of his may be alwayes as it were, pre$ent in our
<foot>M 2 me-</foot>
<p n=>92</p>
memory for he did not write to the vulgar, nor is he obliged to
$pin out his Sillogi$mes with the trivial method of di$putes; nay
rather, u$ing a freedome, he hath $ometimes placed the proof
of one Propo$ition among$t Texts, which $eem to treat of quite
<marg><I>Requi$ites to fit
a man to philo$o-
phate well after
the manner of</I> A-
ri$totle.</marg>
another point; and therefore it is requi$ite to be ma$ter of all
that va$t <I>Idea,</I> and to learn how to connect this pa$$age with that,
and to combine this Text with another far remote from it; for it
is not to be que$tioned but that he who hath thus $tudied him,
knows how to gather from his Books the demon$trations of every
knowable deduction, for that they contein all things.</P>
<P>SAGR. But good <I>Simplicius,</I> like as the things $cattered here
and there in <I>Ari$totle,</I> give you no trouble in collecting them,
but that you per$wade your $elf to be able by comparing and

connecting $everal $mall $entences to extract thence the juice of
$ome de$ired conclu$ion, $o this, which you and other egregi-

ver$es of <I>Virgil,</I> or of <I>Ovid,</I> compo$ing thereof ^{*} <I>Centones,</I> and
therewith explaining all the affairs of men, and $ecrets of Na-

tle Book much $horter than <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ovid,</I> in which are con-
teined all the Sciences, and with very little $tudy, one may gather
out of it a mo$t perfect <I>Idea,</I> and this is the <I>Alphabet</I>; and there
is no doubt but that he who knows how to couple and di$po$e
aright this and that vowel, with tho$e, or tho$e other con$onants,
may gather thence the infallible an$wers to all doubts, and de-
duce from them the principles of all Sciences and Arts, ju$t in the
$ame manner as the Painter from divers $imple colours, laid $eve-
rally upon his <I>Pallate,</I> proceedeth by mixing a little of this and
a little of that, with a little of a third, to repre$ent to the life
men, plants, buildings, birds, fi$hes, and in a word, counterfeit-
ing what ever object is vi$ible, though there be not on the <I>Pallate</I>
all the while, either eyes, or feathers, or fins, or leaves, or $tones.
Nay, farther, it is nece$$ary, that none of the things to be imita-
ted, or any part of them, be actually among colours, if you
would be able therewith to repre$ent all things; for $hould there
be among$t them <I>v. gr.</I> feathers, the$e would $erve to repre$ent
nothing $ave birds, and plumed creatures.</P>

are $ome of his followers that fear before they are in danger,
who give us occa$ion, or, to $ay better, would give us cau$e to
e$teem him le$$e, $hould we con$ent to applaud their <I>Capricio's.</I>

And you, pray you tell me, are you for your part $o $imple, as
not to know that had <I>Arictotle</I> been pre$ent, to have heard the
Doctor that would have made him Author of the <I>Tele$cope,</I> he
would have been much more di$plea$ed with him, than with tho$e,
who laught at the Doctor and his Comments? Do you que$tion
<foot>whe-</foot>
<p n=>94</p>
whether <I>Ari$totle,</I> had he but $een the novelties di$covered in Hea-
ven, would not have changed his opinion, amended his Books,
and embraced the more $en$ible Doctrine; rejecting tho$e $illy
Gulls, which too $crupulou$ly, go about to defend what ever he
hath $aid; not con$idering, that if <I>Ari$totle</I> were $uch a one as
they fancy him to them$elves, he would be a man of an untracta-
ble wit, an ob$tinate mind, a barbarous $oul, a $tubborn will,
that accounting all men el$e but as $illy $heep, would have his
Oracles preferred before the Sen$es, Experience, and Nature her
$elf? They are the Sectators of <I>Aristotle</I> that have given him this
Authority, and not he that hath u$urped or taken it upon him;
and becau$e it is more ea$ie for a man to $culk under anothers
$hield than to $hew him$elf openly, they tremble, and are affraid
to $tir one $tep from him; and rather than they will admit $ome
alterations in the Heaven of <I>Ari$totle,</I> they will impertinently de-
ny tho$e they behold in the Heaven of <I>Nature.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. The$e kind of Drolleries put me in mind of that Statu-
<marg><I>A ridiculous
pa$$age of a certain
Statuary.</I></marg>
ary which having reduced a great piece of Marble to the Image of
an <I>Hercules,</I> or a thundring <I>Jupiter,</I> I know not whether, and
given it with admirable Art $uch a vivacity and threatning fury,
that it moved terror in as many as beheld it; he him$elf began
al$o to be affraid thereof, though all its $prightfulne$$e, and life
was his own workman$hip; and his affrightment was $uch, that
he had no longer the courage to affront it with his Chizzels and
Mallet.</P>
<P>SALV. I have many times wondered how the$e nice maintain-
ers of what ever fell from <I>Ari$totle,</I> are not aware how great a pre-
judice they are to his reputation and credit; and how that the
more they go about to encrea$e his Authority, the more they
dimini$h it; for while$t I $ee them ob$tinate in their attempts
to maintain tho$e Propo$itions which I palpably di$cover to
be manife$tly fal$e; and in their de$ires to per$wade me that
$o to do, is the part of a Philo$opher; and that <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
would do the $ame, it much abates in me of the opinion that he
hath rightly philo$ophated about other conclu$ions, to me more
ab$tru$e: for if I could $ee them concede and change opinion in
a manife$t truth, I would believe, that in tho$e in which they
$hould per$i$t, they may have $ome $olid demon$trations to me un-
known, and unheard of.</P>
<P>SAGR. Or when they $hould be made to $ee that they have ha-
zarded too much of their own and <I>Ari$totle</I>'s repuatation in con-
fe$$ing, that they had not under$tood this or that conclu$ion found
out by $ome other man; would it not be a le$s evil for them to
$eek for it among$t his Texts, by laying many of them together,
according to the art intimated to us by <I>Simplicius</I>? for if his
<foot>works</foot>
<p n=>95</p>
works contain all things knowable, it mu$t follow al$o that they
may be therein di$covered.</P>
<P>SALV. Good <I>Sagredus,</I> make no je$t of this advice, which me
thinks you rehear$e in too Ironical a way; for it is not long $ince
that a very eminent Philo$opher having compo$ed a Book <I>de anim&agrave;,</I>
wherein, citing the opinion of <I>Ari$totle,</I> about its being or not be-
ing immortal, he alledged many Texts, (not any of tho$e hereto-
fore quoted by <I>Alexander ab Alexandro</I>: for in tho$e he $aid, that
<I>Ari$totle</I> had not $o much as treated of that matter, much le$s de-
termined any thing pertaining to the $ame, but others) by him$elf
found out in other more ab$tru$e places, which tended to an er-
roneous $en$e: and being advi$ed, that he would find it an hard
matter to get a Licence from the Inqui$itors, he writ back unto
<marg><I>A brave re$olu-
tion of a certain</I>
Peripatetick <I>Phi-
lo$opher.</I></marg>
his friend, that he would notwith$tanding, with all expedition
procure the $ame, for that if no other ob$tacle $hould interpo$e,
he would not much $cruple to change the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I>
and with other expo$itions, and other Texts to maintain the con-
trary opinion, which yet $hould be al$o agreeable to the $en$e of
<I>Ari$totle.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Oh mo$t profound Doctor, this! that can command
me that I $tir not a $tep from <I>Ari$totle,</I> but will him$elf lead
him by the no$e, and make him $peak as he plea$eth. See how
much it importeth to learn to take <I>Time</I> by the <I>Fore-top.</I> Nor
is it $ea$onable to have to do with <I>Hercules,</I> whil'$t he is en-
raged, and among$t the Furies, but when he is telling merry tales
among$t the <I>Meonion Damo$els.</I> Ah, unheard of $ordidne$$e of
<marg><I>The $ervile $pi-
rit of $ome of</I> Ari-
$totles <I>followers.</I></marg>
$ervile $ouls! to make them$elves willing $laves to other mens opi-
nions; to receive them for inviolable Decrees, to engage them-
$elves to $eem $atisfied and convinced by arguments, of $uch effi-
cacy, and $o manife$tly concludent, that they them$elves can-
not certainly re$olve whether they were really writ to that pur-
po$e, or $erve to prove that a$$umption in hand, or the contrary.
But, which is a greater madne$$e, they are at variance among$t
them$elves, whether the Author him$elf hath held the affirmative
part, or the negative. What is this, but to make an Oracle of a
Log, and to run to that for an$wers, to fear that, to reverence
and adore that?</P>
<P>SIMPL. But in ca$e we $hould recede from <I>Aristotle,</I> who have
we to be our Guid in Philo$ophy? Name you $ome Author.</P>
<P>SALV. We need a Guid in unknown and uncouth wayes, but
in champion places, and open plains, the blind only $tand in need
of a Leader; and for $uch, it is better that they $tay at home.
But he that hath eyes in his head, and in his mind, him $hould
a man choo$e for his Guid. Yet mi$take me not, thinking that I
<marg><I>Too clo$e adhe-
ring to</I> Ari$totle <I>is
blameable.</I></marg>
$peak this, for that I am again$t hearing of <I>Ari$totle</I>; for on the
<foot>con-</foot>
<p n=>96</p>
contrary, I commend the reading, and diligently $tudying of him;
and onely blame the $ervile giving ones $elf up a $lave unto him,
$o, as blindly to $ub$cribe to what ever he delivers, and without
$earch of any farther rea$on thereof, to receive the $ame for an in-
violable decree. Which is an abu$e, that carrieth with it ano-
ther great inconvenience, to wit, that others will no longer take
pains to under$tand the validity of his Demon$trations. And
what is more $hameful, than in the midde$t of publique di$putes,
while$t one per$on is treating of demon$trable conclu$ions, to
hear aother interpo$e with a pa$$age of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and not $el-
dome writ to quite another purpo$e, and with that to $top the
mouth of his opponent? But if you will continue to $tudy in this
manner, I would have you lay a$ide the name of Philo$ophers;
<marg><I>It is not ju$t, that
tho$e who never
philo$ophate, $hould
u$urp the title of
Philo$ophers.</I></marg>
and call your $elves either Hi$torians or Doctors of Memory, for
it is not $it, that tho$e who never philo$ophate, $hould u$urp
the honourable title of Philo$ophers. But it is be$t for us to re-
turn to $hore, and not lanch farther into a boundle$$e Gulph, out
of which we $hall not be able to get before night. Therefore
<I>Simplicius,</I> come either with arguments and demon$trations of
your own, or of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and bring us no more Texts and na-
<marg><I>The Sen$ible
World.</I></marg>
ked authorities, for our di$putes are about the Sen$ible World,
and not one of Paper. And fora$much as in our di$cour$es ye$ter-
day, we retrein'd the Earth from darkne$$e, and expo$ed it to the
open skie, $hewing, that the attempt to enumerate it among$t
tho$e which we call C&oelig;le$tial bodies, was not a po$ition $o foil'd,
and vanqui$h't, as that it had no life left in it; it followeth next,
that we proceed to examine what probability there is for holding
of it fixt, and wholly immoveable, <I>$cilicet</I> as to its entire Globe,
what likelyhood there is for making it moveable with $ome motion,
and of what kind that may be. And fora$much as in this $ame
que$tion I am ambiguous, and <I>Simplicius</I> is re$olute, as likewi$e
<I>Ari$totle</I> for the opinion of its immobility, he $hall one by one
produce the arguments in favour of their opinion, and I will al-
ledge the an$wers and rea$ons on the contrary part; and next <I>Sa-
gredus</I> $hall tell us his thoughts, and to which $ide he finds him-
$elf inclined.</P>
<P>SAGR. Content; provided alwayes that I may re$erve the li-
berty to my $elf of alledging what pure natural rea$on $hall $ome-
times dictate to me.</P>
<P>SALV. Nay more, it is that which I particularly beg of you;
for, among$t the more ea$ie, and, to $o $peak, material con$idera-
tions, I believe there are but few of them that have been omit-
ted by Writers, $o that onely $ome of the more $ubtle, and re-
mote can be de$ired, or wanting; and to inve$tigate the$e, what
other ingenuity can be more $it than that of the mo$t acute and
piercing wit of <I>Sagredus</I>?</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>97</p>
<P>SAGR. I am what ever plea$eth <I>Salviatus,</I> but I pray you,
let us not $ally out into another kind of digre$$ion complemental;
for at this time I am a Philo$opher, and in the Schools, not in the
Court.</P>
<P>SALV. Let our contemplation begin therefore with this con$i-
deration, that what$oever motion may be a$cribed to the Earth,
it is nece$$ary that it be to us, (as inhabitants upon it, and con$e-
quently partakers of the $ame) altogether imperceptible, and as if
it were not at all, $o long as we have regard onely to terre$trial
things; but yet it is on the contrary, as nece$$ary that the $ame
<marg><I>The motions of
the Earth are im-
perceptible to its
inhabitants.</I></marg>
motion do $eem common to all other bodies, and vi$ible ob-
jects, that being $eparated from the Earth, participate not of the
$ame. So that the true method to find whether any kind of motion
may be a$cribed to the Earth, and that found, to know what it
is, is to con$ider and ob$erve if in bodies $eparated from the
Earth, one may di$cover any appearance of motion, which e-
<marg><I>The Earth can
have no other mo-
tions, than tho$e
which to us appear
commune to all the
rest of the Vni-
ver$e, the Earth
excepted.</I></marg>
qually $uiteth to all the re$t; for a motion that is onely $een, <I>v. gr.</I>
in the <I>Moon,</I> and that hath nothing to do with <I>Venus</I> or <I>Jupiter,</I>
or any other Stars, cannot any way belong to the Earth, or to
any other $ave the Moon alone. Now there is a mo$t general and
grand motion above all others, and it is that by which the Sun,
<marg><I>The Diurnal Mo-
tion, $eemeth com-
mune to all the V-
niver$e, $ave onely
the Earth excepted.</I></marg>
the Moon, the other Planets, and the Fixed Stars, and in a word,
the whole Univer$e, the Earth onely excepted, appeareth in our
thinking to move from the Ea$t towards the We$t, in the $pace of
twenty four hours; and this, as to this fir$t appearance, hath no
ob$tacle to hinder it, that it may not belong to the Earth alone,
as well as to all the World be$ides, the Earth excepted; for the
$ame a$pects will appear in the one po$ition, as in the other.
Hence it is that <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy,</I> as having hit upon this con-
<marg>Ari$totle <I>and</I>
Ptolomy <I>argue a-
gain$t the Diur-
nal Motion attri-
buted to the Earth.</I></marg>
$ideration, in going about to prove the Earth to be immoveable,
argue not again$t any other than this <I>Diurnal</I> Motion; $ave onely
that <I>Ari$totle</I> hinteth $omething in ob$cure terms again$t another
Motion a$cribed to it by an <I>Ancient,</I> of which we $hall $peak in
its place.</P>
<P>SAGR. I very well perceive the nece$$ity of your illation: but
I meet with a doubt which I know not how to free my $elf from,
and this it is, That <I>Copernicus</I> a$$igning to the Earth another mo-
tion be$ide the Diurnal, which, according to the rule even now laid
down, ought to be to us, as to appearance, imperceptible in the
Earth, but vi$ible in all the re$t of the World; me thinks I may
nece$$arily infer, either that he hath manife$tly erred in a$$igning
the Earth a motion, to which there appears not a general corre-
$pondence in Heaven; or el$e that if there be $uch a congruity
therein, <I>Ptolomy</I> on the other hand hath been deficient in not con-
futing this, as he hath done the other.</P>
<foot>N SALV.</foot>
<p n=>98</p>
<P>SALV. You have good cau$e for your doubt: and when we
come to treat of the other Motion, you $hall $ee how far <I>Coper-
nicus</I> excelled <I>Ptolomey</I> in clearne$s and $ublimity of wit, in that
he $aw what the other did not, I mean the admirable harmony
wherein that Motion agreed with all the other C&oelig;le$tial Bodies.
But for the pre$ent we will $u$pend this particular, and return to
our fir$t con$ideration; touching which I will proceed to propo$e
(begining with things more general) tho$e rea$ons which $eem to
favour the mobility of the Earth, and then wait the an$wers which
<marg><I>Why the diurnal
motion more pro-
bably $hould belong
to the Earth, than
to the re$t of the
Vniver$e.</I></marg>
<I>Simplicius</I> $hall make thereto. And fir$t, if we con$ider onely
the immen$e magnitude of the Starry Sphere, compared to the
$malne$s of the Terre$trial Globe, contained therein $o many mil-
lions of times; and moreover weigh the velocity of the motion
which mu$t in a day and night make an entire revolution thereof,
I cannot per$wade my $elf, that there is any man who believes it
more rea$onable and credible, that the C&oelig;le$tial Sphere turneth
round, and the Terre$trial Globe $tands $till.</P>
<P>SAGR. If from the univer$ality of effects, which may in nature
have dependence upon $uch like motions, there $hould indifferent-
ly follow all the $ame con$equences to an hair, a$well in one <I>Hypo-
the$is</I> as in the other; yet I for my part, as to my fir$t and general
apprehen$ion, would e$teem, that he which $hould hold it more ra-
tional to make the whole Univer$e move, and thereby to $alve the
Earths mobility, is more unrea$onable than he that being got to
the top of your Turret, $hould de$ire, to the end onely that he
might behold the City, and the Fields about it, that the whole
Country might turn round, that $o he might not be put to the
trouble to $tir his head. And yet doubtle$s the advantages would
be many and great which the <I>Copernican Hypothe$is</I> is attended
with, above tho$e of the <I>Ptolomaique,</I> which in my opinion re-
$embleth, nay $urpa$$eth that other folly; $o that all this makes
me think that far more probable than this. But haply <I>Ari$totle,
Ptolomey,</I> and <I>Simplicius</I> may find the advantages of their Sy-
$teme, which they would do well to communicate to us al$o, if
any $uch there be; or el$e declare to me, that there neither are or
can be any $uch things.</P>
<P>SALV. For my part, as I have not been able, as much as I have
thought upon it, to find any diver$ity therein; $o I think I have
found, that no $uch diver$ity can be in them: in $o much that I
<marg><I>Motion, as to the
things that equally
move thereby, is as
of it never were, &amp;
$o far operates as it
hath relation to
things deprived of
motion.</I></marg>
e$teem it to no purpo$e to $eek farther after it. Therefore ob-
$erve: Motion is $o far Motion, and as Motion operateth, by how
far it hath relation to things which want Motion: but in tho$e
things which all equally partake thereof it hath nothing to do, and
is as if it never were. And thus the Merchandi$es with which a
$hip is laden, $o far move, by how far leaving <I>London,</I> they pa$s
<foot>by</foot>
<p n=>99</p>
by <I>France, Spain, Italy,</I> and $ail to <I>Aleppo,</I> which <I>London, France,
Spain &amp;c.</I> $tand $till, not moving with the $hip: but as to the
Che$ts, Bales and other Parcels, wherewith the $hip is $tow'd and
and laden, and in re$pect of the $hip it $elf, the Motion from <I>Lon-
don</I> to <I>Syria</I> is as much as nothing; and nothing-altereth the re-
lation which is between them: and this, becau$e it is common to
all, and is participated by all alike: and of the Cargo which is in
the $hip, if a Bale were romag'd from a Che$t but one inch onely,
this alone would be in that Cargo, a greater Motion in re$pect of
the Che$t, than the whole Voyage of above three thou$and miles,
made by them as they were $tived together.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This Doctrine is good, $ound, and altogether <I>Peri-
patetick.</I></P>
<P>SALV. I hold it to be much more antient: and $u$pect that <I>A-</I>
<marg><I>A propo$ition ta-
ken by</I> Ari$totle
<I>from the Antients,
but $omewhat al-
tered by him.</I></marg>
<I>ri$totle</I> in receiving it from $ome good School, did not fully under-
$tand it, and that therefore, having delivered it with $ome altera-
tion, it hath been an occa$ion of confu$ion among$t tho$e, who
would defend whatever he $aith. And when he writ, that what-
$oever moveth, doth move upon $omething immoveable, I $uppo$e
that he equivocated, and meant, that whatever moveth, moveth
in re$pect to $omething immoveable; which propo$ition admitteth
no doubt, and the other many.</P>
<P>SAGR. Pray you make no digre$$ion, but proceed in the di$-
$ertation you began.</P>
<P>SALV. It being therefore manife$t, that the motion which is
<marg><I>The fir$t di$cour$e
to prove that the
diurnal motion be-
longs to the Earth.</I></marg>
common to many moveables, is idle, and as it were, null as to the
relation of tho$e moveables between them$elves, becau$e that a-
mong them$elves they have made no change: and that it is ope-
rative onely in the relation that tho$e moveables have to other
things, which want that motion, among which the habitude is
changed: and we having divided the Univer$e into two parts, one
of which is nece$$arily moveable, and the other immoveable; for
the obtaining of what$oever may depend upon, or be required
from $uch a motion, it may as well be done by making the Earth
alone, as by making all the re$t of the World to move: for that
the operation of $uch a motion con$i$ts in nothing el$e, $ave in
the relation or habitude which is between the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies,
and the Earth, the which relation is all that is changed. Now if
for the obtaining of the $ame effect <I>ad unguem,</I> it be all one whe-
ther the Earth alone moveth, the re$t of the Univer$e $tanding
$till; or that, the Earth onely $tanding $till, the whole Univer$e
<marg><I>Nature never
doth that by many
things, which may
be done by a few.</I></marg>
moveth with one and the $ame motion; who would believe, that
Nature (which by common con$ent, doth not that by many things,
which may be done by few) hath cho$en to make an innumerable
number of mo$t va$t bodies move, and that with an unconceivable
<foot>N 2 velocity,</foot>
<p n=>100</p>
velocity, to perform that, which might be done by the moderate
motion of one alone about its own Centre?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I do not well under$tand, how this grand motion $ig-
ni$ieth nothing as to the Sun, as to the Moon, as to the other Pla-
nets, and as to the innumerable multitude of fixed $tars: or why
you $hould $ay that it is to no purpo$e for the Sun to pa$s from one
Meridian to another; to ri$e above this Horizon, to $et beneath
that other; to make it one while day, another while night: the
like variations are made by the Moon, the other Planets, and the
fixed $tars them$elves.</P>
<P>SALV. All the$e alterations in$tanced by you, are nothing, $ave
onely in relation to the Earth: and that this is true, do but i-
<marg><I>The diurnal mo-
tion cau$eth no
mutation among$t
the C&oelig;le$tial Bo-
dies, but all chan-
ges have relation
to the Earth.</I></marg>
magine the Earth to move, and there will be no $uch thing in the
World as the ri$ing or $etting of the Sun or Moon, nor Horizons,
nor Meridians, nor days, nor nights; nor, in a word, will $uch a
motion cau$e any mutation between the Moon and Sun, or any
other $tar what$oever, whether fixed or erratick; but all the$e
changes have relation to the Earth: which all do yet in $um
import no other than as if the Sun $hould $hew it $elf now to
<I>China,</I> anon to <I>Per$ia,</I> then to <I>Egypt, Greece, France, Spain, A-
merica, &amp;c.</I> and the like holdeth in the Moon, and the re$t of the
C&oelig;le$tial Bodies: which $elf $ame effect falls out exactly in the
$ame manner, if, without troubling $o great a part of the Univer$e,
<marg><I>A $ccond con-
firmation that the
diurnal motion be-
longs to the Earth.</I></marg>
the Terre$trial Globe be made to revolve in it $elf. But we will
augment the difficulty by the addition of this other, which is a
very great one, namely, that if you will a$cribe this <I>Great</I> Motion to
Heaven, you mu$t of nece$$ity make it contrary to the particular
motion of all the Orbs of the Planets, each of which without
controver$ie hath its peculiar motion from the We$t towards the
Ea$t, and this but very ea$ie and moderate: and then you make
them to be hurried to the contrary part, <I>i. e.</I> from Ea$t to We$t,
by this mo$t furious diurnal motion: whereas, on the contrary,
making the Earth to move in it $elf, the contrariety of motions is
taken away, and the onely motion from We$t to Ea$t is accom-
modated to all appearances, and exactly $atisfieth every <I>Ph&oelig;no-
menon.</I></P>
<P>SIMPL. As to the contrariety of Motions it would import lit-
<marg><I>Circular moti-
ons are not contra-

Ari$totle.</marg>
tle, for <I>Ari$totle</I> demon$trateth, that circular motions, are not con-
trary to one another; and that theirs cannot be truly called con-
trariety.</P>
<P>SALV. Doth <I>Ari$totle</I> demon$trate this, or doth he not rather
barely affirm it, as $erving to $ome certain de$ign of his? If con-
traries be tho$e things, that de$troy one another, as he him$elf
affirmeth, I do not $ee how two moveables that encounter each
other in a circular line, $hould le$$e prejudice one another, than if
they interfered in a right line.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>101</p>
<P>SAGR. Hold a little, I pray you. Tell me <I>Simplicius,</I> when
two Knights encounter each other, tilting in open field, or when
two whole Squadrons, or two Fleets at Sea, make up to grapple,
and are broken and $unk, do you call the$e encounters contrary to
one another?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Yes, we $ay they are contrary.</P>
<P>SAGR. How then, is there no contrariety in circular motions.
The$e motions, being made upon the $uper$icies of the Earth or
Water, which are, as you know, $pherical, come to be circular.
Can you tell, <I>Simplicius,</I> which tho$e circular motions be, that
are not contrary to each other? They are (if I mi$take not) tho$e
of two circles, which touching one another without, one thereof
being turn'd round, naturally maketh the other move the contra-
ry ^{*} way; but if one of them $hall be within the other, it is im-
<marg>As you $ee in a
Mill, wherein the
implicated cogs $et
the wheels on mo-
ving.</marg>
po$$ible that their motion being made towards different points,
they $hould not ju$tle one another.</P>
<P>SALV. But be they contrary, or not contrary, the$e are but
alterations of words; and I know, that upon the matter, it would
be far more proper and agreeable with Nature, if we could $alve
all with one motion onely, than to introduce two that are (if you
will not call them contrary) oppo$ite; yet do I not cen$ure this
introduction (of contrary motions) as impo$$ible; nor pretend I

which maketh the <I>Ptolomaique Hypothe$is</I> le$$e probable is, that it
mo$t unrea$onably confoundeth the order, which we a$$uredly

which is not que$tionable, but mo$t certain. And that Order is,
<marg><I>The greater Orbs

that according as an Orb is greater, it fini$heth its revolution in a
longer time, and the le$$er, in $horter. And thus <I>Saturn</I> de$cri-
bing a greater Circle than all the other Planets, compleateth the
$ame in thirty yeares: <I>Jupiter</I> fini$heth his; that is le$$e, in
twelve years: <I>Mars</I> in two: The Moon runneth thorow hers, $o
much le$$e than the re$t, in a Moneth onely. Nor do we le$$e
$en$ibly $ee that of the <I>Medicean Stars,</I> which is neare$t to <I>Ju-</I>

<I>piter,</I> to make its revolution in a very $hort time, that is, in four
and forty hours, or thereabouts, the next to that in three dayes and
an half, the third in $even dayes, and the mo$t remote in $ixteen.
And this rate holdeth well enough, nor will it at all alter, while$t
we a$$ign the motion of 24 hours to the Terre$trial Globe, for it
to move round its own center in that time; but if you would have
the Earth immoveable, it is nece$$ary, that when you have pa$t
from the $hort period of the Moon, to the others $ucce$$ively
bigger, until you come to that of <I>Mars</I> in two years, and from
thence to that of the bigger Sphere of <I>Jupiter</I> in twelve years, and
<foot>from</foot>
<p n=>102</p>
from this to the other yet bigger of <I>Saturn,</I> who$e period is of
thirty years, it is nece$$ary, I $ay, that you pa$$e to another
Sphere incomparably greater $till than that, and make this to ac-

compli$h an entire revolution in twenty four hours. And this yet is
the lea$t di$order that can follow. For if any one $hould pa$$e
from the Sphere of <I>Saturn</I> to the Starry Orb, and make it $o
much bigger than that of <I>Saturn,</I> as proportion would require, in
re$pect of its very $low motion, of many thou$ands of years, then
it mu$t needs be a <I>Salt</I> much more ab$urd, to skip from this to
another bigger, and to make it convertible in twenty four hours.
But the motion of the Earth being granted, the order of the pe-
riods will be exactly ob$erved, and from the very $low Sphere of
<I>Saturn,</I> we come to the fixed Stars, which are wholly immovea-

immen$e di$parity between the motions of tho$e $tars them$elves;
of which $ome would come to move mo$t $wiftly in mo$t va$t cir-
cles, others mo$t $lowly in circles very $mall, according as tho$e
or the$e $hould be found nearer, or more remote from the Poles;
which $till is accompanied with an inconvenience, as well becau$e
we $ee tho$e, of who$e motion there is no que$tion to be made,
to move all in very immen$e circles; as al$o, becau$e it $eems to
be an act done with no good con$ideration, to con$titute bodies,
that are de$igned to move circularly, at immen$e di$tances from
the centre, and afterwards to make them move in very $mall cir-
cles. And not onely the magnitudes of the circles, and con$e-

(which $hall be the fifth inconvenience) the $elf-$ame Stars

tho$e, which two thou$and years $ince were in the Equinoctial,

of nece$$ity become more $low of motion, and be reduced to
move in le$$er circles, and it is not altogether impo$$ible but that
a time may come, in which $ome of them which in aforetime had
continually moved, $hall be reduced by uniting with the Pole, to
a $tate of re$t, and then after $ome time of ce$$ation, $hall return
to their motion again; whereas the other Stars, touching who$e
motion none $tand in doubt, do all de$cribe, as hath been $aid,
the great circle of their Orb, and in that maintain them$elves
without any variation. The ab$urdity is farther enlarged (which

as that every Star wandereth to and fro in it, by wayes of its
own, what rules $hall regulate their motions, and to what pur-
po$e, $o, as that being beheld from the Earth, they appear as if
they were made by one onely Sphere? It is my opinion, that they
might $o much more ea$ily do that, and in a more commodious
manner, by being con$tituted immoveable, than by being made
errant, by how much more facile it is to number the quarries in the
Pavement of a <I>Piazza,</I> than the rout of boyes which run up and
down upon them. And la$tly, which is the $eventh in$tance, if
<marg><I>The Seventh Con-

we atribute the Diurnal Motion to the highe$t Heaven, it mu$t be
con$tituted of $uch a force and efficacy, as to carry along with
it the innumerable multitude of fixed Stars, Bodies all of va$t
magnitude, and far bigger than the Earth; and moreover all the
Spheres of the Planets; notwith$tanding that both the$e and tho$e
of their own nature move the contrary way. And be$ides all this,
it mu$t be granted, that al$o the Element of Fire, and the great-
er part of the Air, are likewi$e forcibly hurried along with the
re$t, and that the $ole little Globe of the Earth pertinaciou$ly
$tands $till, and unmoved again$t $uch an impul$e; a thing, which
in my thinking, is very difficult; nor can I $ee how the Earth, a
pendent body, and equilibrated upon its centre, expo$ed indif-
<marg><I>The Earth a

ferently to either motion or re$t, and environed with a liquid <I>am-
bient,</I> $hould not yield al$o as the re$t, and be carried about.
But we find none of the$e ob$tacles in making the Earth to move;
a $mall body, and in$en$ible, compared to the Univer$e, and
therefore unable to offer it any violence.</P>
<P>SAGR. I find my fancy di$turbed with certain conjectures $o con-
fu$edly $prung from your later di$cour$es; that, if I would be ena-
bled to apply my $elf with atention to what followeth, I mu$t of ne-
ce$$ity attempt whether I can better methodize them, and gather
thence their true con$truction, if haply any can be made of them;
and peradventure, the proceeding by interrogations may help me
the more ea$ily to expre$$e my $elf. Therefore I demand fir$t of <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> whether he believeth, that divers motions may natural-
ly agree to one and the $ame moveable body, or el$e that it be
requi$ite its natural and proper motion be onely one.</P>
<P>SIMPL. To one $ingle moveable, there can naturally agree
<marg><I>A $ingle move-
able hath but onely
one natural moti-
on, and all the
re$t are by partici-
pation.</I></marg>
but one $ole motion, and no more; the re$t all happen acciden-
tally and by participation; like as to him that walketh upon the
Deck of a Ship, his proper motion is that of his walk, his motion
by participation that which carrieth him to his Port, whither he
<foot>would</foot>
<p n=>104</p>
would never with his walking have arrived, if the Ship with its
motion had not wafted him thither.</P>
<P>SAGR. Tell me $econdly. That motion, which is communi-
cated to any moveable by participation, while$t it moveth by it
$elf, with another motion different from the participated, is it
nece$$ary, that it do re$ide in $ome certain $ubject by it $elf, or
el$e can it $ub$i$t in nature alone, without other $upport.</P>
<P>SIMPL. <I>Ari$totle</I> giveth you an an$wer to all the$e que$tions,
<marg><I>Motion cannot
be made without
its moveable $ub-
ject.</I></marg>
and tels you, that as of one $ole moveable the motion is but one;
$o of one $ole motion the moveable is but one; and con$equent-
ly, that without the inherence in its $ubject, no motion can ei-
ther $ub$i$t, or be imagined.</P>
<P>SAGR. I would have you tell me in the third place, whether
you beblieve that the Moon and the other Planets and C&oelig;le$tial
bodies, have their proper motions, and what they are.</P>
<P>SIMPL. They have $o, and they be tho$e according to which
they run through the Zodiack, the Moon in a Moneth, the Sun
in a Year, <I>Mars</I> in two, the Starry Sphere in tho$e $o many thou-
$and. And the$e are their proper, or natural motions.</P>
<P>SAGR. But that motion wherewith I $ee the fixed Stars, and
with them all the Planets go unitedly from Ea$t to We$t, and re-
turn round to the Ea$t again in twenty four hours, how doth it
agree with them?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It $uiteth with them by participation.</P>
<P>SAGR. This then re$ides not in them, and not re$iding in
them, nor being able to $ub$i$t without $ome $ubject in which it
is re$ident, it mu$t of force be the proper and natural motion of
$ome other Sphere.</P>
<P>SIMPL. For this purpo$e A$tronomers, and Philo$ophers have
found another high Sphere, above all the re$t, without Stars, to
which Natural agreeth the Diurnal Motion; and this they call
the <I>Primum mobile</I>; the which carrieth along with it all the in-
feriour Spheres, contributing and imparting its motion to
them.</P>
<P>SAGR. But when, without introducing other Spheres unknown
and hugely va$t, without other motions or communicated raptures,
with leaving to each Sphere its $ole and $imple motion, without
intermixing contrary motions, but making all turn one way, as
it is nece$$ary that they do, depending all upon one $ole principle,
all things proceed orderly, and corre$pond with mo$t perfect har-
mony, why do we reject this <I>Ph&oelig;nomenon,</I> and give our a$$ent to
tho$e prodigious and laborious conditions?</P>
<P>SIMPL. The difficulty lyeth in finding out this $o natural and
expeditious way.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>105</p>
<P>SAGR. In my judgment this is found. Make the Earth the
<I>Primum mobile,</I> that is, make it turn round its own <I>axis</I> in twenty
four hours, and towards the $ame point with all the other Spheres;
and without participating this $ame motion to any other Planet or
Star, all $hall have their ri$ings, $ettings, and in a word, all their
other appearances.</P>
<P>SIMPL. The bu$ine$s is, to be able to make the Earth move
without athou$and inconveniences.</P>
<P>SALV. All the inconveniences $hall be removed as fa$t as you
propound them: and the things $poken hitherto are onely the
primary and more general inducements which give us to believe
that the diurnal conver$ion may not altogether without probabi-
lity be applyed to the Earth, rather than to all the re$t of the U-
niver$e: the which inducements I impo$e not upon you as invio-
lable Axioms, but as hints, which carry with them $omewhat of
likelihood. And in regard I know very well, that one $ole ex-
<marg><I>One $ingle ex-
periment, or $ound
demon$tration bat-
tereth down all ar-
guments meerly
probable.</I></marg>
periment, or concludent demon$tration, produced on the contrary
part, $ufficeth to batter to the ground the$e and a thou$and other
probable Arguments; therefore it is not fit to $tay here, but proceed
forwards and hear what <I>Simplicius</I> an$wereth, and what greater
probabilities, or $tronger arguments he alledgeth on the contrary.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will fir$t $ay $omething in general upon all the$e con-
$iderations together, and then I will de$cend to $ome particulars.
It $eems that you univer$ally bottom all you $ay upon the greater
$implicity and facility of producing the $ame effects, whil$t you
hold, that as to the cau$ing of them, the motion of the Earth a-
lone, $erveth <I>as well</I> as that of all the re$t of the World, the Earth
deducted: but as to the operations, you e$teem that much ea$ier
than this. To which I reply, that I am al$o of the $ame opinion,
$o long as I regard my own not onely finite, but feeble power;
but having a re$pect to the $trength of the <I>Mover,</I> which is in-
finite, its no le$$e ea$ie to move the Univer$e, than the Earth,
yea than a $traw. And if his power be infinite, why $hould he not
<marg><I>Of an infinite
power one would
think a greater
part $hould rather
be imploy'd than a
le$$e.</I></marg>
rather exerci$e a greater part thereof than a le$$e? Therefore,
I hold that your di$cour$e in general is not convincing.</P>
<P>SALV. If I had at any time $aid, that the Univer$e moved not
for want of power in the <I>Mover,</I> I $hould have erred, and your
reproof would have been $ea$onable; and I grant you, that to
an infinite power, it is as ea$ie to move an hundred thou$and, as
one. But that which I did $ay, concerns not the Mover, but one-
ly hath re$pect to the Moveables; and in them, not onely to
their re$i$tance, which doubtle$$e is le$$er in the Earth, than in
the Univer$e; but to the many other particulars, but even now
con$idered. As to what you $ay in the next place, that of an in-
finite power it is better to exerci$e a great part than a $mall: I an-
<foot>O $wer,</foot>
<p n=>106</p>
$wer, that of infinite one part is not greater than another, $ince
<marg><I>Of infinity one
part is no bigger
than auother, al-
though they are
comparatively un-
equal.</I></marg>
both are infinite; nor can it be $aid, that of the infinite number,
an hundred thou$and is a greater part than two, though that be
fifty thou$and times greater than this; and if to the moving of
the Univer$e there be required a finite power, though very great
in compari$on of that which $ufficeth to move the Earth onely;
yet is there not implied therein a greater part of the infinite power,
nor is that part le$$e infinite which remaineth unimploy'd. So that
to apply unto a particular effect, a little more, or a little le$$e
power, importeth nothing; be$ides that the operation of $uch
vertue, hath not for its bound or end the Diurnal Motion onely;
but there are $everal other motions in the World, which we
know of, and many others there may be, that are to us unknown.
Therefore if we re$pect the Moveables, and granting it as out of
que$tion, that it is a $horter and ea$ier way to move the Earth,
than the Univer$e; and moreover, having an eye to the $o many
other abreviations, and facilities that onely this way are to be ob-
tained, an infallible Maxime of <I>Ari$totle,</I> which he teacheth us,
that, <I>fru$tra fit per plura, quod pote$t fieri per pauciora,</I> ren-
dereth it more probable that the Diurnal Motion belongs to the
Earth alone, than to the Univer$e, the Earth $ubducted.</P>
<P>SIMPL. In reciting that Axiom, you have omitted a $mall
clau$e, which importeth as much as all the re$t, e$pecially in our
ca$e, that is to $ay, the words <I>&aelig;qu&egrave; bene.</I> It is requi$ite therefore
to examine whether this <I>Hypothe$is</I> doth <I>equally well</I> $atisfie in all
particulars, as the other.</P>
<P>SALV. The knowledg whether both the$e po$itions do <I>&aelig;qu&egrave;
bene,</I> $atisfie, may be comprehended from the particular exami-
nation of the appearances which they are to $atisfie; for hitherto
we have di$cour$ed, and will continue to argue <I>ex hypothe$i,</I>
namely, $uppo$ing, that as to the $atisfaction of the appearances,
<marg><I>In the Axiome</I>
Fru$tra fit per plu-
ra, &amp;c. <I>the addi-
tion of</I> &aelig;que ben&egrave;,
<I>is $uperfluous.</I></marg>
both the a$$umptions are equally accomodated. As to the clau$e
which you $ay was omitted by me, I have more rea$on to $u$pect
that it was $uperfluou$ly in$erted by you. For the expre$$ion <I>&aelig;qu&egrave;
bene,</I> is a relative that nece$$arily requireth two terms at lea$t,
for a thing cannot have relation to its $elf, nor do we $ay, <I>v. gr.</I>
re$t to be <I>equally good,</I> as re$t. And becau$e, when we $ay, <I>that
is done in vain by many means, which may be done with fewer,</I>
we mean, that that which is to be done, ought to be the $ame
thing, not two different ones; and becau$e the $ame thing can-
not be $aid to be done as well as its $elf; therefore, the addition
of the Phra$e <I>&aelig;qu&egrave; bene</I> is $uperfluous, and a relation, that hath
but one term onely.</P>
<P>SAGR. Unle$$e you will have the $ame befal us, as did ye$ter-
day, let us return to our matter in hand; and let <I>Simplicius</I> be-
<foot>gin</foot>
<p n=>107</p>
gin to produce tho$e difficulties that $eem in his opinion, to thwart
this new di$po$ition of the World.</P>
<P>SIMPL. That di$po$ition is not new, but very old, and that
you may $ee it is $o, <I>Ari$totle</I> confuteth it; and his confutations
are the$e: &ldquo;Fir$t if the Earth moveth either in it felf about its

guments for the
Earths quie$$ence.</I></marg>
own Centre, or in an Excentrick Circle, it is nece$$ary that that
$ame motion be violent; for it is not its natural motion, for
if it were, each of its parts would partake thereof; but each
of them moveth in a right line towards its Centre. It being
therefore violent and pteternatural, it could never be perpetu-
al: But the order of the World is perpetual. Therefore, <I>&amp;c.</I>
Secondly, all the other moveables that move circularly, $eem
to ^{*} $tay behind, and to move with more than one motion, the
<marg>* <I>Re$tino indietzo,</I>

here of that moti-
on which a bowl

and $o hindered in

<I>Primum Mobile</I> excepted: Whence it would be nece$$ary that
the Earth al$o do move with two motions; and if that $hould
be $o, it would inevitably follow, that mutations $hould be
made in the Fixed Stars, the which none do perceive; nay
without any variation, the $ame Stars alwayes ri$e from towards
the $ame places, and in the $ame places do $et. Thirdly, the mo-
tion of the parts is the $ame with that of the whole, and natural-
ly tendeth towards the Centre of the Univer$e; and for the $ame
cau$e re$t, being arrived thither. He thereupon moves the que-
$tion whether the motion of the parts hath a tendency to the
centre of the Univer$e, or to the centre of the Earth; and conclu-
deth that it goeth by proper in$tinct to the centre of the Univer$e,
and <I>per accidence</I> to that of the Earth; of which point we largely
di$cour$ed ye$terday. He la$tly confirmeth the $ame with a fourth
argument taken from the experiment of grave bodies, which fal-
ing from on high, de$cend perpendicularly unto the Earths$urface;
and in the $ame manner <I>Projections</I> $hot perpendicularly upwards,
do by the $ame lines return perpendicularly down again, though
they were $hot to a very great height. All which arguments nece$-
$arily prove their motion to be towards the Centre of the Earth,
which without moving at all waits for, and receiveth them. He
intimateth in the la$t place that the A$tronomers alledg other
rea$ons in confirmation of the $ame conclu$ions, I mean of the
Earths being in the Centre of the Univer$e, and immoveable;
and in$tanceth onely in one of them, to wit, that all the <I>Ph&aelig;-
nomena</I> or appearances that are $een in the motions of the Stars,
perfectly agree with the po$ition of the Earth in the Centre;
which would not be $o, were the Earth $eated otherwi$e.
The re$t produced by <I>Ptolomy</I> and the other A$tronomers, I can
give you now if you plea$e, or after you have $poken what you
have to $ay in an$wer to the$e of <I>Ari$totle.&rdquo;</I></P>

of <I>Ari$totle</I> are for the mo$t part taken from things neer at hand,
and he leaveth the others to <I>A$tronomers</I>; and therefore it is the
be$t way, if you like of it, to examine the$e taken from experi-

<marg><I>The fir$t argu-

<P>SALV. All, for the $tronge$t rea$on, alledge that of grave bo-
dies, which falling downwards from on high, move by a right line,
that is perpendicular to the $urface of the Earth, an argument
which is held undeniably to prove that the Earth is immoveable:
for in ca$e it $hould have the diurnal motion, a Tower, from the
top of which a $tone is let fall, being carried along by the conver-
$ion of the Earth, in the time that the $tone $pends in falling, would
be tran$ported many hundred yards Ea$tward, and $o far di$tant
from the Towers foot would the $tone come to ground. The
which effect they back with another experiment; to wit, by let-
<marg><I>Which is confir-
med by the experi-
ment of a body let
fall from the round
top of a Ship.</I></marg>
ting a bullet of lead fall from the round top of a Ship, that lieth at

find to be neer the ^{*} partners of the Ma$t; but if the $ame bullet

be let fall from the $ame place when the $hip is under $ail, it $hall
light as far from the former place, as the $hip hath run in the time
of the leads de$cent; and this for no other rea$on, than becau$e
the natural motion of the ball being at liberty is by a right line to-
<marg><I>The $econd ar-
gument taken from

very high.</I></marg>
wards the centre of the Earth. They forti$ie this argument with
the experiment of a projection $hot on high at a very great di-
$tance; as for example, a ball $ent out of a Cannon, erected per-
pendicular to the horizon, the which $pendeth $o much time in a$-
cending and falling, that in our parallel the Cannon and we both
$hould be carried by the Earth many miles towards the Ea$t, $o
that the ball in its return could never come neer the Peece, but
<marg><I>The third argu-
ment taken from
the $hots of a Can-
non, towards the
Ea$t, and towards
the West.</I></marg>
would fall as far We$t, as the Earth had run Ea$t. They againe
adde a third, and very evident experiment, <I>$cilicet,</I> that $hooting a
bullet point blank (or as Gunners $ay, neither above nor under me-
tal) out of a Culverin towards the Ea$t, and afterwards another,
<foot>with</foot>
<p n=>109</p>
with the $ame charge, and at the $ame elevation or di$port towards
the We$t, the range towards the We$t $hould be very much grea-
ter then the other towards the Ea$t: for that whil'$t the ball goeth
We$tward, and the Peece is carried along by the Earth Ea$tward,
the ball will fall from the Peece as far di$tant as is the aggregate of
the two motions, one made by it $elf towards the We$t, and the
other by the Peece carried about by the Earth towards the Ea$t;
and on the contrary, from the range of the ball $hot Ea$tward you
are to $ub$tract the $pace the Peece moved, being carried after it.
Now $uppo$e, for example, that the range of the ball $hot We$t
were five miles, and that the Earth in the $ame parallel and in the
time of the Bals ranging $hould remove three miles, the Ball in this
ca$e would fall eight miles di$tant from the Culverin, namely, its
own five We$tward, and the Culverins three miles Ea$tward: but
the range of the $hot towards the Ea$t would be but two miles
long, for $o much is the remainder, after you have $ub$tracted
from the five miles of the range, the three miles which the Peece
had moved towards the $ame part. But experience $heweth the
Ranges to be equal, therefore the Culverin, and con$equently the
Earth are immoveable. And the $tability of the Earth is no le$fe
<marg><I>This argument
is confirmed by two
$hots towards the
South and towards
the North.</I></marg>
confirmed by two other $hots made North and South; for they
would never hit the mark, but the Ranges would be alwayes wide,
or towards the We$t, by meanes of the remove the mark would
make, being carried along with the Earth towards the Ea$t, whil'$t
the ball is flying. And not onely $hots made by the Meridians,
<marg><I>And it is like-
wi$e confirmed by
two $hots towards
the Ea$t, and to-
wards the We$t.</I></marg>
but al$o tho$e aimed Ea$t or We$t would prove uncertain; for
tho$e aim'd Ea$t would be too high, and tho$e directed We$t too
low, although they were $hot point blank, as I $aid. For the
Range of the Ball in both the $hots being made by the Tangent,
that is, by a line parallel to the Horizon, and being that in the di-
urnal motion, if it be of the Earth, the Horizon goeth continually
de$cending towards the Ea$t, and ri$ing from the We$t (therefore
the Oriental Stars $eem to ri$e, and the Occidental to decline) $o
that the Oriental mark would de$cend below the aime, and there-
upon the $hot would fly too high, and the a$cending of the We$t-
ern mark would make the $hot aimed that way range too low; $o
that the Peece would never carry true towards any point; and for
that experience telleth us the contrary, it is requi$ite to $ay, that
the Earth is immoveable.</P>
<P>SIMPL. The$e are $olid rea$ons, and $uch as I believe no man
can an$wer.</P>
<P>SALV. Perhaps they are new to you?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Really they are; and now I $ee with how many ad-
mirable experiments Nature is plea$ed to favour us, wherewith to
a$$i$t us in the knowledge of the Truth. Oh! how exactly one

<p n=>110</p>
truth agreeth with another, and all con$pire to render each other
inexpugnable!</P>
<P>SAGR. What pity it is that Guns were not u$ed in <I>Ari$totles</I>
age, he would with help of them have ea$ily battered down ig-
norance, and $poke without h&aelig;$itation of the$e mundane points.</P>
<P>SALV. I am very glad that the$e rea$ons are new unto you, that
$o you may not re$t in the opinion of the <I>major</I> part of <I>Peripate-
ticks,</I> who believe, that if any one for$akes the Doctrine of <I>Ari-
$totle,</I> it is becau$e they did not under$tand or rightly apprehend
his demon$trations. But you may expect to hear of other Novel-
<marg>Copernicus <I>his
followers are not
moved through ig-
nor ance of the ar-
guments on the o-
ther part.</I></marg>
ties, and you $hall $ee the followers of this new Sy$teme produce a-
gain$t them$elves ob$ervations, experiences, and rea$ons of farre
greater force than tho$e alledged by <I>Aristotle, Ptolomy,</I> and other
oppo$ers of the $ame conclu$ions, and by this means you $hall come
to a$certain your $elf that they were not induced through want of
knowledge or experience to follow that opinion.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is requi$ite that upon this occa$ion I relate unto you
$ome accidents that befell me, $o $oon as I fir$t began to hear $peak
of this new doctrine. Being very young, and having $carcely fi-
ni$hed my cour$e of Philo$ophy, which I left off, as being $et upon
other employments, there chanced to come into the$e parts a cer-
tain Foreigner of <I>Ro$tock,</I> who$e name, as I remember, was <I>Chri-</I>
<marg>Chri$tianus Vur-
$titius <I>read certain
Lectures touching
the opinion of</I> Co-
pernicus, <I>&amp; what
en$ued thereupon.</I></marg>
<I>$tianus Vur$titius,</I> a follower of <I>Copernicus,</I> who in an <I>Academy</I>
made two or three Lectures upon this point, to whom many flock't
as Auditors; but I thinking they went more for the novelty of the
$ubject than otherwi$e, did not go to hear him: for I had conclu-
ded with my $elf that that opinion could be no other than a $olemn
madne$$e. And que$tioning $ome of tho$e who had been there, I
perceived they all made a je$t thereof, execpt one, who told me
that the bu$ine$$e was not altogether to be laugh't at, and becau$e
this man was reputed by me to be very intelligent and wary, I re-
pented that I was not there, and began from that time forward as
oft as I met with any one of the <I>Copernican</I> per$wa$ion, to demand
of them, if they had been alwayes of the $ame judgment; and of as
many as I examined, I found not $o much as one, who told me not
that he had been a long time of the contrary opinion, but to have
changed it for this, as convinced by the $trength of the rea$ons pro-
ving the $ame: and afterwards que$tioning them, one by one; to
$ee whether they were well po$$e$t of the rea$ons of the other $ide;
<marg><I>The followers of</I>
Copernicus <I>were
all fir$t again$t
that opinion, but
the Sectators of</I>
Ari$totle <I>&amp;</I> Pto-
lomy, <I>were never
of the other $ide.</I></marg>
I found them all to be very ready and perfect in them; $o that I
could not truly $ay, that they had took up this opinion out of ig-
norance, vanity, or to $hew the acutene$$e of their wits. On the
contrary, of as many of the <I>Peripateticks</I> and <I>Ptolomeans</I> as I
have asked (and out of curio$ity I have talked with many) what
pains they had taken in the Book of <I>Copernicus,</I> I found very
<foot>few</foot>
<p n=>111</p>
few that had $o much as $uperficially peru$ed it; but of tho$e
whom, I thought, had under$tood the $ame, not one; and more-
over, I have enquired among$t the followers of the <I>Peripatetick</I>
Doctrine, if ever any of them had held the contrary opinion, and
likewi$e found none that had. Whereupon con$idering that there
was no man who followed the opinion of <I>Copernicus,</I> that had
not been fir$t on the contrary $ide, and that was not very well ac-
quainted with the rea$ons of <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy</I>; and, on the
contrary, that there is not one of the followers of <I>Ptolomy</I> that
had ever been of the judgment of <I>Copernicus,</I> and had left that,
to imbrace this of <I>Ari$totle,</I> con$idering, I $ay, the$e things, I
began to think, that one, who leaveth an opinion imbued with
his milk, and followed by very many, to take up another owned
by very few, and denied by all the Schools, and that really
$eems a very great Paradox, mu$t needs have been moved, not
to $ay forced, by more powerful rea$ons. For this cau$e, I am
become very curious to dive, as they $ay, into the bottom of this
bu$ine$$e, and account it my great good fortune that I have met
you two, from whom I may without any trouble, hear all that
hath been, and, haply, can be $aid on this argument, a$$uring
my $elf that the $trength of your rea$ons will re$olve all $cruples,
and bring me to a certainty in this $ubject.</P>
<P>SIMPL. But its po$$ible your opinion and hopes may be di$ap-
pointed, and that you may find your $elves more at a lo$$e in the
end than you was at fir$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am very confident that this can in no wi$e befal
me.</P>
<P>SIMPL. And why not? I have a manife$t example in my $elf,
that the farther I go, the more I am confounded.</P>
<P>SAGR. This is a $ign that tho$e rea$ons that hitherto $eemed
concluding unto you, and a$$ured you in the truth of your opi-
nion, begin to change countenance in your mind, and to let you
by degrees, if not imbrace, at lea$t look towards the contrary te-
nent; but I, that have been hitherto indifferent, do greatly hope
to acquire re$t and $atisfaction by our future di$cour$es, and you
will not deny but I may, if you plea$e but to hear what per$wa-
deth me to this expectation.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will gladly hearken to the $ame, and $hould be no
le$$e glad that the like effect might be wrought in me.</P>
<P>SAGR. Favour me therefore with an$wering to what I $hall ask
you. And fir$t, tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> is not the conclu$ion, which
we $eek the truth of, Whether we ought to hold with <I>Ari$totle</I>
and <I>Ptolomy,</I> that the Earth onely abiding without motion in the
Centre of the Univer$e, the C&oelig;le$tial bodies all move, or el$e,
Whether the Starry Sphere and the Sun $tanding $till in the Centre,
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>112</p>
the Earth is without the $ame, and owner of all tho$e motions that
in our $eeming belong to the Sun and fixed Stars?</P>
<P>SIMPL. The$e are the conclu$ions which are in di$pute.</P>
<P>SAGR. And the$e two conclu$ions, are they not of $uch a na-
ture, that one of them mu$t nece$$arily be true, and the other
fal$e?</P>
<P>SIMPL. They are $o. We are in a <I>Dilemma,</I> one part of which
mu$t of nece$$ity be true, and the other untrue; for between Mo-
tion and Re$t, which are contradictories, there cannot be in$tanced
a third, $o as that one cannot $ay the Earth moves not, nor $tands
$till; the Sun and Stars do not move, and yet $tand not $till.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Earth, the Sun, and Stars, what things are they in
nature? are they petite things not worth our notice, or grand and
worthy of con$ideration?</P>
<P>SIMPL They are principal, noble, integral bodies of the Uni-
ver$e, mo$t va$t and con$iderable.</P>
<P>SAGR. And Motion, and Re$t, what accidents are they in
Nature?</P>
<marg><I>Motion and re$t
principal accidents
in nature.</I></marg>
<P>SIMPL. So great and principal, that Nature her $elf is defined
by them.</P>
<P>SAGR. So that moving eternally, and the being wholly immo-
veable are two conditions very con$iderable in Nature, and indi-
cate very great diver$ity; and e$pecially when a$cribed to the
principal bodies of the Univer$e, from which can en$ue none but
very different events.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Yea doubtle$$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now an$wer me to another point. Do you believe that
in <I>Logick, Rhethorick,</I> the <I>Phy$icks, Metaphy$icks, Mathematicks,</I>
and finally, in the univer$ality of Di$putations there are arguments
$ufficient to per$wade and demon$trate to a per$on the fallacious,
no le$$e then the true conclu$ions?</P>
<marg><I>Vntruths cannot
be demonstrated,
as Truths are.</I></marg>
<P>SIMPL. No Sir; rather I am very confident and certain, that
for the proving of a true and nece$$ary conclu$ion, there are in
<marg><I>For proof of true
conclu$ions, many
$olid arguments
may be produced,
but to prove a fal-
$ity, none.</I></marg>
nature not onely one, but many very powerfull demon$trations:
and that one may di$cu$$e and handle the $ame divers and $undry
wayes, without ever falling into any ab$urdity; and that the more
any Sophi$t would di$turb and muddy it, the more clear would its
certainty appear: And that on the contrary to make a fal$e po$i-
tion pa$$e for true, and to per$wade the belief thereof, there can-
not be any thing produced but fallacies, Sophi$ms, Paralogi$mes,
Equivocations, and Di$cour$es vain, incon$i$tant, and full of re-
pugnances and contradictions.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now if eternal motion, and eternal re$t be $o princi-
pal accidents of Nature, and $o different, that there can depend
on them only mo$t different con$equences, and e$pecially when
<foot>applied</foot>
<p n=>113</p>
applyed to the Sun, and to the Earth, $o va$t and famous bodies
of the Univer$e; and it being, moreover, impo$$ible, that one of
two contradictory Propo$itions, $hould not be true, and the other
fal$e; and that for proof of the fal$e one, any thing can be pro-
duced but fallacies; but the true one being per$wadeable by all
kind of concluding and demon$trative arguments, why $hould
you think that he, of you two, who $hall be $o fortunate as to
maintain the true Propo$ition ought not to per$wade me? You
mu$t $uppo$e me to be of a $tupid wit, perver$e judgment, dull
mind and intellect, and of a blind rea$on, that I $hould not be
able to di$tingui$h light from darkne$$e, jewels from coals, or
truth from fal$hood.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I tell you now, and have told you upon other
occa$ions, that the be$t Ma$ter to teach us how to di$cern So-
phi$mes, Paralogi$mes, and other fallacies, was <I>Ari$totle,</I> who
in this particular can never be deceived.</P>
<P>SAGR. You in$i$t upon <I>Aristotle,</I> who cannot $peak. Yet I
tell you, that if <I>Ari$totle</I> were here, he would either yield him-
<marg>Ari$totle <I>would
either refute his
adver$aries argu-
ments, or would
alter his opinion.</I></marg>
$elf to be per$waded by us, or refuting our arguments, convince
us by better of his own. And you your $elf, when you heard the
experiments of the Suns related, did you not acknowledg and
admire them, and confe$$e them more concludent than tho$e of
<I>Ari$totle?</I> Yet neverthele$$e I cannot perceive that <I>Salviatus,</I>
who hath produced them, examined them, and with exqui$ite
care $can'd them, doth confe$$e him$elf per$waded by them; no
nor by others of greater force, which he intimated that he was
about to give us an account of. And I know not on what grounds
you $hould cen$ure Nature, as one that for many Ages hath
been lazie, and forgetful to produce $peculative <I>wits</I>; and
that knoweth not how to make more $uch, unle$$e they be $uch
kind of men as $lavi$hly giving up their judgments to <I>Ari$totle,</I> do
under$tand with his brain, and re$ent with his $en$es. But let us
hear the re$idue of tho$e rea$ons which favour his opinion, that
we may thereupon proceed to $peak to them; comparing and
weighing them in the ballance of impartiality.</P>
<P>SALV. Before I proceed any farther, I mu$t tell <I>Sagredus,</I> that
in the$e our Di$putations, I per$onate the <I>Copernican,</I>, and imi-
tate him, as if I were his <I>Zany</I>; but what hath been effected in
my private thoughts by the$e arguments which I $eem to alledg in
his favour, I would not have you to judg by what I $ay, whil'$t
I am in the heat of acting my part in the Fable; but after I have
laid by my di$gui$e, for you may chance to find me different
from what you $ee me upon the Stage. Now let us go on.</P>
<P><I>Ptolomy</I> and his followers produce another experiment like to
<marg><I>An argument
taken from the
Clouds, and from
Birds.</I></marg>
that of the Projections, and it is of things that being $eparated
<foot>P from</foot>
<p n=>114</p>
from the Earth, continue a good $pace of time in the Air, $uch
as are the Clouds, Birds of flight; and as of them it cannot be
$aid that they are rapt or tran$parted by the Earth, having no ad-
he$ion thereto, it $eems not po$$ible, that they $hould be able to
keep pace with the velocity thereof; nay it $hould rather $eem
to us, that they all $wiftly move towards the We$t: And if
being carried about by the Earth, pa$$e our parallel in twenty
four hours, which yet is at lea$t $ixteen thou$and miles, how can
Birds follow $uch a cour$e or revolution? Whereas on the con-
trary, we $ee them fly as well towards the Ea$t, as towards the
We$t, or any other part, without any $en$ible difference. More-
<marg><I>An argument
taken from the air
which we feel to
beat upon us when
we run a Hor$e at
full $peed.</I></marg>
over, if when we run a Hor$e at his $peed, we feel the air beat
vehemently again$t our face, what an impetuous bla$t ought we
perpetually to feel from the Ea$t, being carried with $o rapid a
cour$e again$t the wind? and yet no $uch effect is perceived. Take
another very ingenious argument inferred from the following ex-
<marg><I>An argument
taken from the
whirling of circu-
lar motion, which
hath a faculty to
extrude and di$$i-
pate.</I></marg>
periment. The circular motion hath a faculty to extrude and di$-
$ipate from its Centre the parts of the moving body, when$oever
either the motion is not very $low, or tho$e parts are not very
well fa$tened together; and therefore, if <I>v. g.</I> we $hould turn
one of tho$e great wheels very fa$t about, wherein one or more
men walking, crane up very great weights, as the huge ma$$ie
$tone, u$ed by the Callander for pre$$ing of Cloaths; or the
fraighted Barks which being haled on $hore, are hoi$ted out of
one river into another; in ca$e the parts of that $ame Wheel $o
$wiftly turn'd round, be not very well joyn'd and pin'd together,
they would all be $hattered to pieces; and though many $tones or
other ponderous $ub$tances, $hould be very fa$t bound to its outward
Rimme, yet could they not re$i$t the impetuo$ity, which with
great violence would hurl them every way far from the Wheel,
and con$equently from its Centre. So that if the Earth did move
with $uch and $o much greater velocity, what gravity, what tena-
city of lime or plai$ter would keep together Stones, Buildings, and
whole Cities, that they $hould not be to$t into the Air by $o pre-
cipitous a motion? And both men and bea$ts, which are not fa-
$tened to the Earth, how could they re$i$t $o great an <I>impetus</I>?
Whereas, on the other $ide, we $ee both the$e, and far le$$e re-
$i$tances of pebles, $ands, leaves re$t quietly on the Earth, and
to return to it in falling, though with a very $low motion. See
here, <I>Simplicius,</I> the mo$t potent arguments, taken, to $o $peak,
from things Terre$trial; there remain tho$e of the other kind,
namely, $uch as have relation to the appearances of Heaven,
which rea$ons, to confe$$e the truth, tend more to prove the
Earth to be in the centre of the Univer$e, and con$equently, to
deprive it of the annual motion about the $ame, a$cribed unto it
<foot>by</foot>
<p n=>115</p>
by <I>Copernicus.</I> Which arguments, as being of $omewhat a di$te-
rent nature, may be produced, after we have examined the
$trength of the$e already propounded.</P>
<P>SAGR. What $ay you <I>Simplicius</I>? do you think that <I>Salviatus</I>
is Ma$ter of, and knoweth how to unfold the <I>Ptolomean</I> and <I>Ari-
$totelian</I> arguments? Or do you think that any <I>Peripatetick</I> is e-
qually ver$t in the <I>Copernican</I> demon$trations?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Were it not for the high e$teem, that the pa$t di$cour-
$es have begot in me of the learning of <I>Salviatus,</I> and of the a-
cutene$$e of <I>Sagredus,</I> I would by their good leave have gone my
way without $taying for their an$wers; it $eeming to me a thing
impo$$ible, that $o palpable experiments $hould be contradicted;
and would, without hearing them farther, con$irm my $elf in my
old per$wa$ion; for though I $hould be made to $ee that it was er-
roneous, its being upheld by $o many probable rea$ons, would ren-
der it excu$eable. And if the$e are fallacies, what true demon$tra-
tions were ever $o fair?</P>
<P>SAGR. Yet its good that we hear the re$pon$ions of <I>Salviatus</I>;
which if they be true, mu$t of nece$$ity be more fair, and that by
in$inite degrees; and tho$e mu$t be deformed, yea mo$t deformed,
if the Metaphy $ical Axiome hold, That true and fair are one and
<marg><I>True and fair
are one and the
$ame, as al$o fal$e
and deformed.</I></marg>
the $ame thing; as al$o fal$e and deformed. Therefore <I>Salviatus</I>
let's no longer lo$e time.</P>
<P>SALV. The fir$t Argument alledged by <I>Simplicius,</I> if I well re-
member it, was this. The Earth cannot move circularly, becau$e
$uch motion would be violent to the $ame, and therefore not per-
petual: that it is violent, the rea$on was: Becau$e, that had it been
natural, its parts would likewi$e naturally move round, which is
impo$$ible, for that it is natural for the parts thereof to move with a
right motion downwards. To this my reply is, that I could glad-
ly wi$h, that <I>Ari$totle</I> had more cleerly expre$t him$elf, where he
<marg><I>The an$wer to</I>
Ari$totles <I>fir$t ar-
gument.</I></marg>
$aid; That its parts would likewi$e move circularly; for this mo-
ving circularly is to be under$tood two wayes, one is, that every
particle or atome $eparated from its <I>Whole</I> would move circularly
about its particular centre, de$cribing its $mall Circulets; the other
is, that the whole Globe moving about its centre in twenty four
hours, the parts al$o would turn about the $ame centre in four and
twenty hours. The fir$t would be no le$$e an impertinency, than
if one $hould $ay, that every part of the circumference of a Circle
ought to be a Circle; or becau$e that the Earth is Spherical, that
therefore every part thereof be a Globe, for $o doth the <I>Axiome</I>
require: <I>Eadem e$t ratio totius, &amp; partium.</I> But if he took it in
the other $en$e, to wit, that the parts in imitation of the <I>Whole</I>
$hould move naturally round the Centre of the whole Globe in
twenty four hours, I $ay, that they do $o; and it concerns you,
<foot>P 2 in$tead</foot>
<p n=>116</p>
in$tead of <I>Ari$totle,</I> to prove that they do not.</P>
<P>SIMPL. This is proved by <I>Ari$totle</I> in the $ame place, when he
$aith, that the natural motion of the parts is the right motion
downwards to the centre of the Univer$e; $o that the circular
motion cannot naturally agree therewith.</P>
<P>SALV. But do not you $ee, that tho$e very words carry in them
a confutation of this $olution?</P>
<P>SIMPL. How? and where?</P>
<P>SALV. Doth not he $ay that the circular motion of the Earth
would be violent? and therefore not eternal? and that this is ab-
$urd, for that the order of the World is eternal?</P>
<P>SIMPL. He $aith $o.</P>
<P>SALV. But if that which is violent cannot be eternal, then by
<marg><I>That which is
violent, cannot be
eternal, and that
which cannot be e-
ternal, cannot be
natural.</I></marg>
conver$ion, that which cannot be eternal, cannot be natural: but
the motion of the Earth downwards cannot be otherwi$e eternal;
therefore much le$$e can it be natural: nor can any other motion
be natural to it, $ave onely that which is eternal. But if we make
the Earth move with a circular motion, this may be eternal to it,
and to its parts, and therefore natural.</P>
<P>SIMPL. The right motion is mo$t natural to the parts of the
Earth, and is to them eternal; nor $hall it ever happen that they
move not with a right motion; alwayes provided that the impe-
diments be removed.</P>
<P>SALV. You equivocate <I>Simplicius</I>; and I will try to free you
from the equivoke. Tell me, therefore, do you think that a
Ship which $hould $ail from the Strait of <I>Gibralter</I> towards <I>Pale-
$tina</I> can eternally move towards that Coa$t? keeping alwayes an
equal cour$e?</P>
<P>SIMPL. No doubtle$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. And why not?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Becau$e that Voyage is bounded and terminated be-
tween the <I>Herculean</I> Pillars, and the $hore of the <I>Holy-land</I>; and
the di$tance being limited, it is pa$t in a finite time, unle$$e one by
returning back $hould with a contrary motion begin the $ame Voy-
age anew; but this would be an interrupted and no continued
motion.</P>
<P>SALV. Very true. But the Navigation from the Strait of <I>Ma-
galanes</I> by the <I>Pacifick</I> Ocean, the <I>Moluccha's,</I> the Cape <I>di buona
Speranza,</I> and from thence by the $ame Strait, and then again by
the <I>Pacifick</I> Ocean, &amp;c. do you believe that it may be perpe-
tuated?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It may; for this being a circumgyration, which re-
turneth about its $elf, with infinite replications, it may be perpetu-
ated without any interruption.</P>
<P>SALV. A Ship then may in this Voyage continue $ailing eter-
nally.</P>
<foot>SIMPL.</foot>
<p n=>117</p>
<P>SIMPL. It may, in ca$e the Ship were incorruptible, but the
Ship decaying, the Navigation mu$t of nece$$ity come to an end.</P>
<P>SALV. But in the Mediterrane, though the Ve$$el were incor-
ruptible, yet could $he not $ail perpetually towards <I>Pale$tina,</I> that
<marg><I>Two things re-
qui$ite to the end a
motion may per-
petuate it $elf; an
unlimited $pace,
and an incorrupti-
ble moveable.</I></marg>
Voyage being determined. Two things then are required, to the
end a moveable may without intermi$$ion move perpetually; the
one is, that the motion may of its own nature be indeterminate and
infinite; the other, that the moveable be likewi$e incorruptible
and eternal.</P>
<P>SIMPL. All this is nece$$ary.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore you may $ee how of your own accord you
have confe$$ed it impo$$ible that any moveable $hould move eter-
nally in a right line, in regard that right motion, whether it be up-
<marg><I>Right motion

wards, or downwards, is by you your $elf bounded by the circum-
ference and centre; $o that if a Moveable, as $uppo$e the Earth
be eternal, yet fora$much as the right motion is not of its own na-
ture eternall, but mo$t ^{*}terminate, it cannot naturally $uit with
<marg>* Terminati$$imo.</marg>
the Earth. Nay, as was $aid ^{*} ye$terday, <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf is
<marg>* By this expre$$i-
on he every where
means the prece-
ding Dialogue, or
<I>Giornata.</I></marg>
con$trained to make the Terre$trial Globe eternally immoveable.
When again you $ay, that the parts of the Earth evermore move
downwards, all impediments being removed, you egregiou$ly equi-
vocate; for then, on the other $ide they mu$t be impeded, contra-
ried, and forced, if you would have them move; for, when they
are once fallen to the ground, they mu$t be violently thrown up-
wards, that they may a $econd time fall; and as to the impedi-
ments, the$e only hinder its arrival at the centre; but if there were
a <I>Well,</I> that did pa$$e thorow and beyond the centre, yet would not
a clod of Earth pa$$e beyond it, unle$$e ina$much as being tran$-
ported by its <I>impetus,</I> it $hould pa$$e the $ame to return thither a-
gain, and in the end there to re$t. As therefore to the defending,
that the motion by a right line doth or can agree naturally neither
to the Earth, nor to any other moveable, whil'$t the Univer$e re-
taineth its perfect order, I would have you take no further paines a-
bout it, but (unle$$e you will grant them the circular motion)
your be$t way will be to defend and maintain their immobility.</P>
<P>SIMPL. As to their immoveablene$$e, the arguments of <I>Ari-
$totle,</I> and moreover tho$e alledged by your $elf $eem in my opini-
on nece$$arily to conclude the $ame, as yet; and I conceive it will
be a hard matter to refute them.</P>
<P>SALV. Come we therefore to the $econd Argument, which was,
That tho$e bodies, which we are a$$ured do move circularly, have
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the $econd argu-
ment.</I></marg>
more than one motion, unle$$e it be the <I>Primum Mobile</I>; and
therefore, if the Earth did move circularly, it ought to have two
motions; from which alterations would follow in the ri$ing and
$etting of the Fixed Stars: Which effect is not perceived to en$ue.
<foot>There-</foot>
<p n=>118</p>
Therefore, &amp;c. The mo$t proper and genuine an$wer to this Alle-
gation is contained in the Argument it $elf; and even <I>Aristotle</I>
puts it in our mouths, which it is impo$$ible, <I>Simplicius,</I> that you
$hould not have $een.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I neither have $een it, nor do I yet apprehend it.</P>
<P>SALV. This cannot be, $ure, the thing is $o very plain.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will with your leave, ca$t an eye upon the <I>Text.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. We will command the <I>Text</I> to be brought forthwith.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I alwayes carry it about with me: See here it is, and
I know the place perfectly well, which is in <I>lib. 2. De C&aelig;lo, cap.</I>
16. Here it is, <I>Text</I> 97. <I>Preterea omnia, qu&aelig; feruntur latione

<marg>* Subde$icere.</marg>
carried with circular motion, $eem to ^{*} fore$low, and to move
with more than one motion, except the fir$t Sphere; wherefore
it is nece$$ary that the Earth move with two motions, whether
<marg>* Or Centre.</marg>
it be carried about the ^{*} middle, or placed in the middle. But
if it be $o, there would of nece$$ity be alterations and conver$i-
ons made among$t the fixed Stars. But no $uch thing is $een to
be done, but the $ame Star doth alwayes ri$e and $et in the $ame
place. In all this I find not any falacy, and my thinks the argu-
ment is very forcible.</P>
<P>SALV. And this new reading of the place hath confirmed me
in the fallacy of the Sillogi$me, and moreover, di$covered ano-
ther fal$ity. Therefore ob$erve. The Po$itions, or if you will,
Conclu$ions, which <I>Ari$totle</I> endeavours to oppo$e, are two; one
is that of tho$e, who placing the Earth in the mid$t of the World,
do make it move in it $elf about its own centre. The other is of
tho$e, who con$tituting it far from the middle, do make it re-
volve with a circular motion about the middle of the Univer$e.
And both the$e Po$itions he conjointly impugneth with one and
the $ame argument. Now I affirm that he is out in both the one
and the other impugnation; and that his error again$t the fir$t
Po$ition is an Equivoke or Paralogi$me; and his mi$take touch-
<marg>Ari$totles <I>argu-
ment again$t the
Earths motion, is
defective in two
things</I></marg>
ing the $econd is a fal$e con$equence. Let us begin with the fir$t
A$$ertion, which con$tituteth the Earth in the mid$t of the
World, and maketh it move in it $elf about its own centre; and
<marg>* The $ame word
which a little above
I tendred $tay <*>e-
hind, as a bowle
when it meets with
ruls.</marg>
let us confront it with the objection of <I>Ari$totle</I>; $aying, All
moveables, that move circularly, $eem to ^{*} fore$low, and move
with more than one Byas, except the fir$t Sphere (that is <I>the pri-</I>
<foot><I>mum</I></foot>
<p n=>119</p>
<I>mum mobile</I>) therefore the Earth moving about its own centre,
being placed in the middle, mu$t of nece$$ity have two bya$$es,
and fore$low. But if this were $o, it would follow, that there
$hould be a variation in the ri$ing and $etting of the fixed Stars,
which we do not perceive to be done: Therefore the Earth doth
not move, <I>&amp;c.</I> Here is the Paralogi$me, and to di$cover it, I will
argue with <I>Ari$totle</I> in this manner. Thou $ai$t, oh <I>Ari$totle,</I>
that the Earth placed in the middle of the World, cannot move
in it $elf (<I>i. e.</I> upon its own <I>axis</I>) for then it would be requi$ite
to allow it two bya$$es; $o that, if it $hould not be nece$$ary to
allow it more than one Byas onely, thou woulde$t not then hold
it impo$$ible for it to move onely with that one; for thou would'$t
unnece$$arily have con$ined the impo$$ibility to the plurality of
bya$$es, if in ca$e it had no more but one, yet it could not move
with that. And becau$e that of all the moveables in the World,
thou make$t but one alone to move with one $ole byas; and all
the re$t with more than one; and this $ame moveable thou af-
firme$t to be the fir$t Sphere, namely, that by which all the fix-
ed and erratick Stars $eem harmoniou$ly to move from Ea$t to
We$t, if in ca$e the Earth may be that fir$t Sphere, that by mo-
ving with one by as onely, may make the Stars appear to move
from Ea$t to We$t, thou wilt not deny them it: But he that af-
firmeth, that the Earth being placed in the mid$t of the World,
moveth about its own Axis, a$cribes unto it no other motion,
$ave that by which all the Stars appear to move from Ea$t to We$t;
and $o it cometh to be that fir$t Sphere, which thou thy $elf ac-
knowledge$t to move with but one by as onely. It is therefore ne-
ce$$ary, oh <I>Ari$totle,</I> if thou wilt conclude any thing, that thou
demon$trate, that the Earth being placed in the mid$t of the
World, cannot move with $o much as one by as onely; or el$e,
that much le$$e can the fir$t Sphere have one $ole motion; for o-
therwi$e thou doe$t in thy very Sillogi$me both commit the falacy,
and detect it, denying, and at that very time proving the $ame
thing. I come now to the $econd Po$ition, namely, of tho$e
who placing the Earth far from the mid$t of the Univer$e, make
it moveable about the $ame; that is, make it a Planet and erra-
tick Star; again$t which the argument is directed, and as to
form is concludent, but faileth in matter. For it being granted,
that the Earth doth in that manner move, and that with two by-
a$$es, yet doth it not nece$$arily follow that though it were $o,
it $hould make alterations in the ri$ings and $ettings of the fixed
Stars, as I $hall in its proper place declare. And here I could
gladly excu$e <I>Ari$totle</I>; rather I could highly applaud him for ha-
ving light upon the mo$t $ubtil argument that could be produced
again$t the <I>Copernican Hypothe$is</I>; and if the objection be inge-
<foot>nious,</foot>
<p n=>120</p>
nious, and to outward appearance mo$t powerful, you may $ee
how much more acute and ingenious the $olution mu$t be, and
not to be found by a wit le$$e piercing than that of <I>Copernicus</I>;
and again from the difficulty in under$tanding it, you may argue
the $o much greater difficulty in finding it. But let us for the pre-
$ent $u$pend our an$wer, which you $hall under$tand in due time
and place, after we have repeated the objection of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and
that in his favour, much $trengthened. Now pa$$e we to <I>Ari-</I>
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the third argu-
ment.</I></marg>
<I>$totles</I> third Argument, touching which we need give no farther
reply, it having been $ufficiently an$wered betwixt the di$cour$es
of ye$terday and to day: In as much as he urgeth, that the mo-
tion of grave bodies is naturally by a right line to the centre; and
then enquireth, whether to the centre of the Earth, or to that
of the Univer$e, and concludeth that they tend naturally to the
centre of the Univer$e, but accidentally to that of the Earth.
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the fourth argu-
ment.</I></marg>
Therefore we may proceed to the fourth, upon which its requi$ite
that we $tay $ome time, by rea$on it is founded upon that expe-
riment, from whence the greater part of the remaining argu-
ments derive all their $trength. <I>Ari$totle</I> $aith therefore, that it is
a mo$t convincing argument of the Earths immobility, to $ee
that projections thrown or $hot upright, return perpendicularly
by the $ame line unto the $ame place from whence they were $hot
or thrown. And this holdeth true, although the motion be of a
very great height; which could never come to pa$$e, did the
Earth move: for in the time that the projected body is moving
upwards and downwards in a $tate of $eparation from the Earth,
the place from whence the motion of the projection began, would
be pa$t, by means of the Earths revolution, a great way to-
wards the Ea$t, and look how great that $pace was, $o far from
that place would the projected body in its de$cent come to the
ground. So that hither may be referred the argument taken from
a bullet $hot from a Canon directly upwards; as al$o that other
u$ed by <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy,</I> of the grave bodies that falling
from on high, are ob$erved to de$cend by a direct and perpendicu-
lar line to the $urface of the Earth. Now that I may begin to untie
the$e knots, I demand of <I>Simplicius</I> that in ca$e one $hould deny
to <I>Ptolomy</I> and <I>Ari$totle</I> that weights in falling freely from on
high, de$cend by a right and perpendicular line, that is, directly
to the centre, what means he would u$e to prove it?</P>
<P>SIMPL. The means of the $en$es; the which a$$ureth us, that
that Tower or other altitude, is upright and perpendicular, and
$heweth us that that $tone, or other grave body, doth $lide along
the Wall, without inclining a hairs breadth to one $ide or ano-
ther, and light at the foot thereof ju$t under the place from whence
it was let fall.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>121</p>
<P>SALV. But if it $hould happen that the Terre$trial Globe did
move round, and con$equently carry the Tower al$o along with
it, and that the $tone did then al$o grate and $lide along the $ide of
the Tower, what mu$t its motion be then?</P>
<P>SIMPL. In this ca$e we may rather $ay its motions: for it
would have one wherewith to de$cend from the top of the Tower
to the bottom, and $hould nece$$arily have another to follow the
cour$e of the $aid Tower.</P>
<P>SALV. So that its motion $hould be compounded of two, to
wit, of that wherewith it mea$ureth the Tower, and of that o-
ther wherewith it followeth the $ame: From which compo$ition
would follow, that the $tone would no longer de$cribe that $imple
right and perpendicular line, but one tran$ver$e, and perhaps not
$treight.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I can $ay nothing of its non-rectitude, but this I know
very well, that it would of nece$$ity be tran$ver$e, and different
from the other directly perpendicular, which it doth de$cribe, the
Earth $tanding $till.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ee then, that upon the meer ob$erving the falling
$tone to glide along the Tower, you cannot certainly affirm that
it de$cribeth a line which is $treight and perpendicular, unle$s you
fir$t $uppo$e that the Earth $tandeth $till.</P>
<P>SIMPL. True; for if the Earth $hould move, the $tones mo-
tion would be tran$ver$e, and not perpendicular.</P>
<P>SALV. Behold then the Paralogi$m of <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomey</I>
<marg><I>The Paralogi$m
of</I> Ari$totle <I>and</I>
Ptolomey <I>in $up-
po$ing that for

to be evident and manife$t, and di$covered by you your $elf,
wherein that is $uppo$ed for known, which is intended to be de-
mon$trated.</P>
<P>SIMPL. How can that be? To me it appeareth that the
Syllogi$m is rightly demon$trated without <I>petitionem principii.</I></P>
<P>SALV. You $hall $ee how it is; an$wer me a little. Doth he
not lay down the conclu$ion as unknown?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Unknown; why otherwi$e the demon$trating it would
be $uperfluous.</P>
<P>SALV. But the middle term, ought not that to be known?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Its nece$$ary that it $hould; for otherwi$e it would be
a proving <I>ignotum per &aelig;qu&egrave; ignotum.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Our conclu$ion which is to be proved, and which is un-
known, is it not the $tability of the Earth?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It is the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. The middle term, which ought to be known, is it not the
$treight and perpendicular de$cent of the $tone?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It is $o.</P>
<P>SALV. But was it not ju$t now concluded, that we can have
no certain knowledg whether that $ame $hall be direct and perpen-
<foot>Q dicular,</foot>
<p n=>122</p>
dicular, unle$s we fir$t know that the Earth $tands $till? Therefore
in your Syllogi$m the certainty of the middle term is a$$umed
from the uncertainty of the conclu$ion. You may $ee then, what
and how great the Paralogi$m is.</P>
<P>SAGR. I would, in favour of <I>Simplicius,</I> defend <I>Ari$totle</I> if it
were po$$ible, or at lea$t better $atisfie my $elf concerning the
$trength of your illation. You $ay, that the $eeing the $tone rake
along the Tower, is not $ufficient to a$$ure us, that its motion is
perpendicular (which is the middle term of the Syllogi$m) unle$s
it be pre$uppo$ed, that the Earth $tandeth $till, which is the con-
clu$ion to be proved: For that if the Tower did move together
with the Earth, and the $tone did $lide along the $ame, the motion
of the $tone would be tran$ver$e, and not perpendicular. But I
$hall an$wer, that $hould the Tower move, it would be impo$$ible
that the $tone $hould fall gliding along the $ide of it; and there-
fore from its falling in that manner the $tability of the Earth is in-
ferred.</P>
<P>SIMPL. It is $o; for if you would have the $tone in de$cend-
ing to grate upon the Tower, though it were carried round by
the Earth, you mu$t allow the $tone two natural motions, to wit,
the $traight motion towards the Centre, and the circular about
the Centre, the which is impo$$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Ari$totles</I> defen$e then con$i$teth in the impo$$ibilitie,
or at lea$t in his e$teeming it an impo$$ibility, that the $tone $hould
move with a motion mixt of right and circular: for if he did
not hold it impo$$ible that the $tone could move to the Centre,
and about the Centre at once, he mu$t have under$tood, that it
might come to pa$s that the cadent $tone might in its de$cent, race
the Tower as well when it moved as when it $tood $till; and con-
$equently he mu$t have perceived, that from this grating nothing
could be inferred touching the mobility or immobility of the
Earth. But this doth not any way excu$e <I>Aristotle</I>; a$well be-
cau$e he ought to have expre$t it, if he had had $uch a conceit, it
being $o material a part of his Argument; as al$o becau$e it can
neither be $aid that $uch an effect is impo$$ible, nor that <I>Ari$totle</I>
did e$teem it $o. The fir$t cannot be affirmed, for that by and
by I $hall $hew that it is not onely po$$ible, but nece$$ary: nor
<marg>Ari$totle <I>admit-
teth that the Fire
moveth directly
upwards by na-
ture, and round a-
bout by participa-
tion.</I></marg>
much le$s can the $econd be averred, for that <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
granteth fire to move naturally upwards in a right line, and to
move about with the diurnal motion, imparted by Heaven to the
whole Element of Fire, and the greater part of the Air: If there-
fore he held it not impo$$ible to mix the right motion upwards,
with the circular communicated to the Fire and Air from the con-
cave of the Moon, much le$s ought he to account impo$$ible the
mixture of the right motion downwards of the $tone, with the
<foot>circular</foot>
<p n=>123</p>
circular which we pre$uppo$e natural to the whole Terre$trial
Globe, of which the $tone is a part.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I $ee no $uch thing: for if the element of Fire re-
volve round together with the Air, it is a very ea$ie, yea a nece$$ary
thing, that a $park of fire which from the Earth mounts upwards,
in pa$$ing thorow the moving air, $hould receive the $ame motion,
being a body $o thin, light, and ea$ie to be moved: but that a
very heavy $tone, or a Canon bullet, that de$cendeth from on
high, and that is at liberty to move whither it will, $hould $uffer
it $elf to be tran$ported either by the air or any other thing, is
altogether incredible. Be$ides that, we have the Experiment,
which is $o proper to our purpo$e, of the $tone let fall from the
round top of the Ma$t of a $hip, which when the $hip lyeth $till,
falleth at the Partners of the Ma$t; but when the $hip $aileth, falls
$o far di$tant from that place, by how far the $hip in the time of
the $tones falling had run forward; which will not be a few fa-
thoms, when the $hips cour$e is $wift.</P>
<P>SALV. There is a great di$parity between the ca$e of the Ship
<marg><I>The di$parity be-
tween the fall of a
$tone from the
round top of a $hip,
and from the top
of a tower.</I></marg>
and that of the Earth, if the Terre$trial Globe be $uppo$ed to have
a diurnal motion. For it is a thing very manife$t, that the mo-
tion of the Ship, as it is not natural to it, $o the motion of all tho$e
things that are in it is accidental, whence it is no wonder that the
$tone which was retained in the round top, being left at liberty,
de$cendeth downwards without any obligation to follow the mo-
tion of the Ship. But the diurnal conver$ion is a$cribed to the
Terre$trial Globe for its proper and natural motion, and con$e-
quently, it is $o to all the parts of the $aid Globe; and, as being
impre$s'd by nature, is indelible in them; and therefore that $tone
that is on the top of the Tower hath an intrin$ick inclination of
revolving about the Centre of its <I>Whole</I> in twenty four hours, and
this $ame natural in$tinct it exerci$eth eternally, be it placed in any
$tate what$oever. And to be a$$ured of the truth of this, you
have no more to do but to alter an antiquated impre$$ion made
in your mind; and to $ay, Like as in that I hitherto holding it to
be the property of the Terre$trial Globe to re$t immoveable about
its Centre, did never doubt or que$tion but that all what$oever
particles thereof do al$o naturally remain in the $ame $tate of re$t:
So it is rea$on, in ca$e the Terre$trial Globe did move round by
natural in$tinct in twenty four hours, that the intrin$ick and natu-
ral inclination of all its parts $hould al$o be, not to $tand $till, but
<marg>*That you may not
$u$pect my tran$la-
tion, or wonder
what Oars have to
do with a $hip, you
are to know that
the Author intends
the Gallies u$ed in
the Mediterrane.</marg>
to follow the $ame revolution. And thus without running into
any inconvenience, one may conclude, that in regard the motion
conferred by the force of ^{*}Oars on the Ship, and by it on all the
things that are contained within her, is not natural but forreign, it
is very rea$onable that that $tone, it being $eparated from the $hip,
<foot>Q 2 do</foot>
<p n=>124</p>
do reduce its $elf to its natural di$po$ure, and return to exerci$e
<marg><I>The part of the
Air inferiour to
the higher moun-
tains doth follow
the motion of the
Earth.</I></marg>
its pure $imple in$tinct given it by nature. To this I add, that
it's nece$$ary, that at lea$t that part of the Air which is beneath the
greater heights of mountains, $hould be tran$ported and carried
round by the roughne$s of the Earths $urface; or that, as being
mixt with many Vapours, and terrene Exhalations, it do na-
turally follow the diurnal motion, which occurreth not in the
Air about the $hip rowed by Oars: So that your arguing
from the $hip to the Tower hath not the force of an illation;
becau$e that $tone which falls from the round top of the Ma$t,
entereth into a <I>medium,</I> which is unconcern'd in the motion
of the $hip: but that which departeth from the top of the Tower,
finds a <I>medium</I> that hath a motion in common with the whole Ter-
re$trial Globe; $o that without being hindred, rather being a$$i$ted
by the motion of the air, it may follow the univer$al cour$e of the
Earth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I cannot conceive that the air can imprint in a very
<marg><I>The motion of the
Air apt to carry
with it light things
but not heavy.</I></marg>
great $tone, or in a gro$s Globe of Wood or Ball of Lead, as
$uppo$e of two hundred weight, the motion wherewith its $elf is
moved, and which it doth perhaps communicate to feathers, $now,
and other very light things: nay, I $ee that a weight of that na-
ture, being expo$ed to any the mo$t impetuous wind, is not there-
by removed an inch from its place; now con$ider with your $elf
whether the air will carry it along therewith.</P>
<P>SALV. There is great difference between your experiment and
our ca$e. You introduce the wind blowing again$t that $tone,
$uppo$ed in a $tate of re$t, and we expo$e to the air, which already
moveth, the $tone which doth al$o move with the $ame velocity;
$o that the air is not to conferr a new motion upon it, but onely
to maintain, or to $peak better, not to hinder the motion already
acquired: you would drive the $tone with a $trange and preter-
natural motion, and we de$ire to con$erve it in its natural. If
you would produce a more pertinent experiment, you $hould $ay,
that it is ob$erved, if not with the eye of the forehead, yet with
that of the mind, what would evene, if an eagle that is carried by
the cour$e of the wind, $hould let a $tone fall from its talons;
which, in regard that at its being let go, it went along with the
wind, and after it was let fall it entered into a <I>medium</I> that mo-
ved with equal velocity, I am very confident that it would not be
$een to de$cend in its fall perpendicularly, but that following the
cour$e of the wind, and adding thereto that of its particular gra-
vity, it would move with a tran$ver$e motion.</P>
<P>SIMPI. But it would fir$t be known how $uch an experiment
may be made; and then one might judg according to the event.
In the mean time the effect of the $hip doth hitherto incline to fa-
vour our opinion.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>125</p>
<P>SALV. Well $aid you <I>hitherto,</I> for perhaps it may anon change
countenance. And that I may no longer hold you in $u$pen$e,
tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> do you really believe, that the Experiment of
the $hip $quares $o very well with our purpo$e, as that it ought to
be believed, that that which we $ee happen in it, ought al$o to
evene in the Terre$trial Globe?</P>
<P>SIMPL. As yet I am of that opinion; and though you have
alledged $ome $mall di$parities, I do not think them of $o great
moment, as that they $hould make me change my judgment.</P>
<P>SALV. I rather de$ire that you would continue therein, and
hold for certain, that the effect of the Earth would exactly an$wer
that of the $hip: provided, that when it $hall appear prejudicial to
your cau$e, you would not be humorous and alter your thoughts.
You may haply $ay, Fora$much as when the $hip $tands $till, the
$tone falls at the foot of the Ma$t, and when $he is under $ail, it
lights far from thence, that therefore by conver$ion, from the $tones
falling at the foot is argued the $hips $tanding $till, and from its
falling far from thence is argued her moving; and becau$e that
which occurreth to the $hip, ought likewi$e to befall the Earth:
that therefore from the falling of the $tone at the foot of the Tow-
er is nece$$arily inferred the immobility of the Terre$trial Globe.
Is not this your argumentation?</P>
<P>SIMPL. It is; and reduced into that conci$ene$s, as that it is
become mo$t ea$ie to be apprehended.</P>
<P>SALV. Now tell me; if the $tone let fall from the Round-
top, when the $hip is in a $wift cour$e, $hould fall exactly in
the $ame place of the $hip, in which it falleth when the $hip is at
anchor, what $ervice would the$e experiments do you, in order to
the a$certaining whether the ve$$el doth $tand $till or move?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Ju$t none: Like as, for exemple, from the beating of
the pul$e one cannot know whether a per$on be a$leep or awake,
$eeing that the pul$e beateth after the $ame manner in $leeping as
in waking.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well. Have you ever tryed the experiment of the
Ship?</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have not; but yet I believe that tho$e Authors
which alledg the $ame, have accurately ob$erved it; be$ides that
the cau$e of the di$parity is $o manife$tly known, that it admits
of no que$tion.</P>
<P>SALV. That it is po$$ible that tho$e Authors in$tance in it,
without having made tryal of it, you your $elf are a good te$ti-
mony, that without having examined it, alledg it as certain, and in
a credulous way remit it to their authority; as it is now not onely
po$$ible, but very probable that they likewi$e did; I mean, did
remit the $ame to their Predece$$ors, without ever arriving at one
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>126</p>
that had made the experiment: for whoever $hall examine the
$ame, $hall find the event $ucceed quite contrary to what hath
been written of it: that is, he $hall $ee the $tone fall at all times
in the $ame place of the Ship, whether it $tand $till, or move with
any what$oever velocity. So that the $ame holding true in the
<marg><I>The stone falling
from the Mast of
a $hip lights in the
$ame place, whe-
ther the $hip doth
move or ly still.</I></marg>
Earth, as in the Ship, one cannot from the $tones falling perpen-
dicularly at the foot of the Tower, conclude any thing touching
the motion or re$t of the Earth.</P>
<P>SIMPL. If you $hould refer me to any other means than to
experience, I verily believe our Di$putations would not come to
an end in ha$te; for this $eemeth to me a thing $o remote from all
humane rea$on, as that it leaveth not the lea$t place for credulity
or probability.</P>
<P>SALV. And yet it hath left place in me for both.</P>
<P>SIMPL. How is this? You have not made an hundred, no nor
one proof thereof, and do you $o confidently affirm it for true?
I for my part will return to my incredulity, and to the confidence
I had that the Experiment hath been tried by the principal Au-
thors who made u$e thereof, and that the event $ucceeded as they
affirm.</P>
<P>SALV. I am a$$ured that the effect will en$ue as I tell you; for $o
it is nece$$ary that it $hould: and I farther add, that you know your
$elf that it cannot fall out otherwi$e, however you feign or $eem to
feign that you know it not. Yet I am $o good at taming of wits,
that I will make you confe$s the $ame whether you will or no. But
<I>Sagredus</I> $tands very mute, and yet, if I mi$take not, I $aw him
make an offer to $peak $omewhat.</P>
<P>SAGR. I had an intent to $ay $omething, but to tell you true, I
know not what it was; for the curio$ity that you have moved in me,
by promi$ing that you would force <I>Simplicius</I> to di$cover the
knowledg which he would conceal from us, hath made me to de-
po$e all other thoughts: therefore I pray you to make good your
vaunt.</P>
<P>SALV. Provided that <I>Simplicius</I> do con$ent to reply to what I
$hall ask him, I will not fail to do it.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I will an$wer what I know, a$$ured that I $hall not be
much put to it, for that of tho$e things which I hold to be fal$e,
I think nothing can be known, in regard that Science re$pecteth
truths and not fal$hoods.</P>
<P>SALV. I de$ire not that you $hould $ay or reply, that you know
any thing, $ave that which you mo$t a$$uredly know. Therefore
tell me; If you had here a flat $uperficies as polite as a Looking-
gla$s, and of a $ub$tance as hard as $teel, and that it were not pa-
ralel to the Horizon, but $omewhat inclining, and that upon it
you did put a Ball perfectly $pherical, and of a $ub$tance grave and
<foot>hard,</foot>
<p n=>127</p>
hard, as $uppo$e of bra$s; what think you it would do being let
go? do not you believe (as for my part I do) that it would lie
$till?</P>
<P>SIMPL. If that $uperficies were inclining?</P>
<P>SALV. Yes; for $o I have already $uppo$ed.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I cannot conceive how it $hould lie $till: nay, I am
confident that it would move towards the declivity with much pro-
pen$ne$s.</P>
<P>SALV. Take good heed what you $ay, <I>Simplicius,</I> for I am
confident that it would lie $till in what ever place you $hould lay
it.</P>
<P>SIMPL. So long as you make u$e of $uch $uppo$itions, <I>Sal-
viatus,</I> I $hall cea$e to wonder if you inferr mo$t ab$urd con-
clu$ions.</P>
<P>SALV. Are you a$$ured, then, that it would freely move to-
wards the declivity?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Who doubts it?</P>
<P>SALV. And this you verily believe, not becau$e I told you $o,
(for I endeavoured to per$wade you to think the contrary) but of
your $elf, and upon your natural judgment.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Now I $ee what you would be at; you $poke not this
as really believing the $ame; but to try me, and to wre$t matter
out of my own mouth wherewith to condemn me.</P>
<P>SALV. You are in the right. And how long would that Ball
move, and with what velocity? But take notice that I in$tanced
in a Ball exactly round, and a plain exqui$itely poli$hed, that all
external and accidental impediments might be taken away. And
$o would I have you remove all ob$tructions cau$ed by the Airs re-
$i$tance to divi$ion, and all other ca$ual ob$tacles, if any other
there can be.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I very well under$tand your meaning, and as to your
demand, I an$wer, that the Ball would continue to move <I>in in-
finitum,</I> if the inclination of the plain $hould $o long la$t, and con-
tinually with an accelerating motion; for $uch is the nature of
ponderous moveables, that <I>vires acquirant eundo</I>: and the great-
er the declivity was, the greater the velocity would be.</P>
<P>SALV. But if one $hould require that that Ball $hould move
upwards on that $ame $uperficies, do you believe that it would
$o do?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Not $pontaneou$ly; but being drawn, or violently
thrown, it may.</P>
<P>SALV. And in ca$e it were thru$t forward by the impre$$ion of
$ome violent <I>impetus</I> from without, what and how great would
its motion be?</P>
<P>SIMPL. The motion would go continually decrea$ing and re-
<foot>tarding,</foot>
<p n=>128</p>
tarding, as being contrary to nature; and would be longer or
$horter, according to the greater or le$s impul$e, and according to
the greater or le$s acclivity.</P>
<P>SALV. It $eems, then, that hitherto you have explained to me
the accidents of a moveable upon two different Planes; and that
in the inclining plane, the grave moveable doth $pontaneou$ly de-
$cend, and goeth continually accelerating, and that to retain it in
re$t, force mu$t be u$ed therein: but that on the a$cending plane,
there is required a force to thru$t it forward, and al$o to $tay it in
re$t, and that the motion impre$$ed goeth continually dimini$hing,
till that in the end it cometh to nothing. You $ay yet farther,
that in both the one and the other ca$e, there do ari$e differences
from the planes having a greater or le$s declivity or acclivity; $o
that the greater inclination is attended with the greater velocity;
and contrariwi$e, upon the a$cending plane, the $ame moveable
thrown with the $ame force, moveth a greater di$tance, by how
much the elevation is le$s. Now tell me, what would befall the
$ame moveable upon a $uperficies that had neither acclivity nor
declivity?</P>
<P>SIMPL. Here you mu$t give me a little time to con$ider of an
an$wer. There being no declivity, there can be no natural incli-
nation to motion: and there being no acclivity, there can be no
re$i$tance to being moved; $o that there would ari$e an indiffe-
rence between propen$ion and re$i$tance of motion; therefore,
methinks it ought naturally to $tand $till. But I had forgot my
$elf: it was but even now that <I>Sagredus</I> gave me to under$tand
that it would $o do.</P>
<P>SALV. So I think, provided one did lay it down gently: but
if it had an <I>impetus</I> given it towards any part, what would fol-
low?</P>
<P>SIMP. There would follow, that it $hould move towards that
part.</P>
<P>SALV. But with what kind of motion? with the continually
accelerated, as in declining planes; or with the $ucce$$ively re-
tarded, as in tho$e a$cending.</P>
<P>SIMP. I cannot tell how to di$cover any cau$e of acceleration,
or retardation, there being no declivity or acclivity.</P>
<P>SALV. Well: but if there be no cau$e of retardation, much
le$s ought there to be any cau$e of re$t. How long therefore
would you have the moveable to move?</P>
<P>SIMP. As long as that $uperficies, neither inclined nor decli-
ned $hall la$t.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore if $uch a $pace were interminate, the motion
upon the $ame would likewi$e have no termination, that is, would
be perpetual.</P>
<foot>SIMPL</foot>
<p n=>129</p>
<P>SIMP. I think $o, if $o be the moveable be of a matter
durable.</P>
<P>SALV. That hath been already $uppo$ed, when it was $aid,
that all external and accidental impediments were removed, and
the brittlene$$e of the moveable in this our ca$e, is one of tho$e
impediments accidental. Tell me now, what do you think is the
cau$e that that $ame Ball moveth $pontaneou$ly upon the inclining
plane, and not without violence upon the erected?</P>
<P>SIMP. Becau$e the inclination of grave bodies is to move to-
wards the centre of the Earth, and onely by violence upwards to-
wards the circumference; and the inclining $uperficies is that
which acquireth vicinity to the centre, and the a$cending one,
remotene$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore a $uperficies, which $hould be neither de-
clining nor a$cending, ought in all its parts to be equally di-
$tant from the centre. But is there any $uch $uperficies in the
World?</P>
<P>SIMP. There is no want thereof: Such is our Terre$trial
Globe, if it were more even, and not as it is rough and montai-
nous; but you have that of the Water, at $uch time as it is calm
and $till.</P>
<P>SALV. Then a $hip which moveth in a calm at Sea, is one of
tho$e moveables, which run along one of tho$e $uperficies that
are neither declining nor a$cending, and therefore di$po$ed, in
ca$e all ob$tacles external and accidental were removed, to move
with the impul$e once imparted ince$$antly and uniformly.</P>
<P>SIMPL. It $hould $eem to be $o.</P>
<P>SALV. And that $tone which is on the round top, doth not it
move, as being together with the $hip carried about by the cir-
cumference of a Circle about the Centre; and therefore con$e-
quently by a motion in it indelible, if all extern ob$tacles be
removed? And is not this motion as $wift as that of the $hip.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Hitherto all is well. But what followeth?</P>
<P>SALV. Then in good time recant, I pray you, that your la$t
conclu$ion, if you are $atisfied with the truth of all the pre-
mi$es.</P>
<P>SIMPL. By my la$t conclu$ion, you mean, That that $ame
$tone moving with a motion indelibly impre$$ed upon it, is not to
leave, nay rather is to follow the $hip, and in the end to light in
the $elf $ame place, where it falleth when the $hip lyeth $till; and
$o I al$o grant it would do, in ca$e there were no outward impe-
diments that might di$turb the $tones motion, after its being let
go, the which impediments are two, the one is the moveables
inability to break through the air with its meer <I>impetus</I> onely, it
being deprived of that of the $trength of Oars, of which it had
<foot>R been</foot>
<p n=>130</p>
been partaker, as part of the $hip, at the time that it was upon
the Ma$t; the other is the new motion of de$cent, which al$o
mu$t needs be an hinderance of that other progre$$ive motion.</P>
<P>SALV. As to the impediment of the Air, I do not deny it
you; and if the thing falling were a light matter, as a feather,
or a lock of wool, the retardation would be very great, but in
an heavy $tone is very exceeding $mall. And you your $elf but
even now did $ay, that the force of the mo$t impetuous wind
$ufficeth not to $tir a great $tone from its place; now do but con-
$ider what the calmer air is able to do, being encountred by a
$tone no more $wift than the whole $hip. Neverthele$$e, as I $aid
before, I do allow you this $mall effect, that may depend upon
$uch an impediment; like as I know, that you will grant to me,
that if the air $hould move with the $ame velocity that the $hip
and $tone hath, then the impediment would be nothing at all.
As to the other of the additional motion downwards; in the fir$t
place it is manife$t, that the$e two, I mean the circular, about
the centre, and the $treight, towards the centre, are not contra-
ries, or de$tructive to one another, or incompatible. Becau$e that
as to the moveable, it hath no repugnance at all to $uch motions,
for you your $elf have already confe$t the repugnance to be a-
gain$t the motion which removeth from the centre, and the incli-
nation to be towards the motion which approacheth to the centre.
Whence it doth of nece$$ity follow, that the moveable hath nei-
ther repugnance, nor propen$ion to the motion which neither ap-
proacheth, nor goeth from the centre, nor con$equently is there
any cau$e for the dimini$hing in it the faculty impre$$ed. And for-
a$much as the moving cau$e is not one alone, which it hath at-
tained by the new operation of retardation; but that they are
two, di$tinct from each other, of which, the gravity attends on-
ly to the drawing of the moveable towards the centre, and the
vertue impre$s't to the conducting it about the centre, there re-
maineth no occa$ion of impediment.</P>
<P>SIMPL. Your argumentation, to give you your due, is very
probable; but in reality it is invelloped with certain intricacies,
that are not ea$ie to be extricated. You have all along built upon
<marg><I>The project ac-
cording to</I> Ari$to-
tle, <I>is not moved by
vertue impre$$ed,
but by the</I> medium.</marg>
a $uppo$ition, which the <I>Peripatetick</I> Schools will not ea$ily grant
you, as being directly contrary to <I>Aristotle,</I> and it is to take for
known and manife$t, That the project $eparated from the proji-
cient, continueth the motion by <I>vertue impre$$ed</I> on it by the
$aid projicient, which <I>vertue impre$$ed</I> is a thing as much dete-
$ted in <I>Peripatetick</I> Philo$ophy, as the pa$$age of any accident
from one $ubject into another. Which doctrine doth hold, as I
believe it is well known unto you, that the project is carried by
the <I>medium,</I> which in our ca$e happeneth to be the Air. And
<foot>there-</foot>
<p n=>131</p>
therefore if that $tone let fall from the round top, ought to fol-
low the motion of the $hip, that effect $hould be a$cribed to the
Air, and not to the vertue impre$$ed. But you pre$uppo$e that
the Air doth not follow the motion of the $hip, but is tranquil.
Moreover, he that letteth it fall, is not to throw it, or to give
it <I>impetus</I> with his arm, but ought barely to open his hand and let
it go; and by this means, the $tone, neither through the vertue
impre$$ed by the projicient, nor through the help of the Air,
$hall be able to follow the $hips motion, and therefore $hall be
left behind.</P>
<P>SALV. I think then that you would $ay, that if the $tone be
not thrown by the arm of that per$on, it is no longer a pro-
jection.</P>
<P>SIMPL. It cannot be properly called a motion of projection.</P>
<P>SALV. So then that which <I>Ari$totle</I> $peaks of the motion, the
moveable, and the mover of the projects, hath nothing to do
with the bu$ine$$e in hand; and if it concern not our purpo$e,
why do you alledg the $ame?</P>
<P>SIMP. I produce it on the ocea$ion of that impre$$ed vertue,
named and introduced by you, which having no being in the
World, can be of no force; for <I>non-entium null&aelig; $unt operatio-
nes</I>; and therefore not onely of projected, but of all other pre-
ternatural motions, the moving cau$e ought to be a$cribed to the
<I>medium,</I> of which there hath been no due con$ideration had;
and therefore all that hath been $aid hitherto is to no purpo$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Go to now, in good time. But tell me, $eeing that
your in$tance is wholly grounded upon the nullity of the vertue
impre$$ed, if I $hall demon$trate to you, that the <I>medium</I> hath
nothing to do in the continuation of projects, after they are $e-
patated from the projicient, will you admit of the impre$$ed ver-
tue, or will you make another attempt to overthrow it?</P>
<P>SIMP. The operation of the <I>medium</I> being removed, I $ee not
how one can have recour$e to any thing el$e $ave the faculty im-
pre$$ed by the mover.</P>
<P>SALV. It would be well, for the removing, as much as is
po$$ible, the occa$ions of multiplying contentions, that you
would explain with as much di$tinctne$$e as may be, what is that
operation of the <I>medium</I> in continuing the motion of the project.</P>
<marg><I>Operation of the</I>
medium <I>in continu-
ing the motion of
the project.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. The projicient hath the $tone in his hand, and with
force and violence throws his arm, with which jactation the
$tone doth not move $o much as the circumambient Air; $o that
when the $tone at its being for$aken by the hand, findeth it $elf
in the Air, which at the $ame time moveth with impetou$ity, it
is thereby born away; for, if the air did not operate, the $tone
would fall at the foot of the projicient or thrower.</P>
<foot>R2 SALV.</foot>
<p n=>132</p>
<marg><I>Many experi-
ments, and rea-
$ons again$t the
cau$e of the moti-
on of projects, a$-
$igned by</I> Ari$totle.</marg>
<P>SALV. And was you $o credulous, as to $uffer your $elf to be
per$waded to believe the$e fopperies, $o long as you had your
$en$es about you to confute them, and to under$tand the
truth thereof? Therefore tell me, that great $tone, and that
Canon bullet, which but onely laid upon a table, did continue
immoveable again$t the mo$t impetuous winds, according as you a
little before did affirm, if it had been a ball of cork or other light
$tuffe, think you that the wind would have removed it from its
place?</P>
<P>SIMP. Yes, and I am a$$ured that it would have blown it
quite away, and with $o much more velocity, by how much the
matter was lighter, for upon this rea$on we $ee the clouds to be
tran$ported with a velocity equal to that of the wind that drives
them.</P>
<P>SALV. And what is the Wind?</P>
<P>SIMP. The Wind is defined to be nothing el$e but air moved.</P>
<P>SALV. Then the moved air doth carry light things more
$wiftly, and to a greater di$tance, then it doth heavy.</P>
<P>SIMP. Yes certainly.</P>
<P>SALV. But if you were to throw with your arm a $tone, and a
lock of cotton wool, which would move $wi$te$t and farthe$t?</P>
<P>SIMP. The $tone by much; nay the wool would fall at my
feet.</P>
<P>SALV. But, if that which moveth the projected $ub$tance, af-
ter it is delivered from the hand, be no other than the air moved
by the arm, and the moved air do more ea$ily bear away light
than grave matters, how cometh it that the project of wool flieth
not farther, and $wifter than that of $tone? Certainly it argu-
eth that the $tone hath $ome other impul$e be$ides the motion of
the air. Furthermore, if two $trings of equal length did hang
at yonder beam, and at the end of one there was fa$tened a bul-
let of lead, and a ball of cotton wool at the other, and both
were carried to an equal di$tance from the perpendicular, and
then let go; it is not to be doubted, but that both the one and
the other would move towards the perpendicular, and that being
carried by their own <I>impetus,</I> they would go a certain $pace be-
yond it, and afterwards return thither again. But which of the$e
two pendent Globes do you think, would continue longe$t in mo-
tion, before that it would come to re$t in its perpendicularity?</P>
<P>SIMP. The ball of lead would $wing to and again many times,
and that of wool but two or three at the mo$t.</P>
<P>SALV. So that that <I>impetus</I> and that <I>mobility</I> what$oever is
the cau$e thereof, would con$erve its $elf longer in grave $ub-
$tances, than light; I proceed now to another particular, and de-
mand of you, why the air doth not carry away that Lemon
which is upon that $ame Table?</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>133</p>
<P>SIMP. Becau$e that the air it $elf is not moved</P>
<P>SALV. It is requi$ite then, that the projicient do confer mo-
tion on the Air, with which it afterward moveth the project. But
if $uch a motion cannot be impre$$ed [<I>i. e. imparted</I>] it being im-
po$$ible to make an accident pa$$e out of one $ubject into another,
how can it pa$$e from the arm into the Air? Will you $ay that the
Air is not a $ubject different from the arm?</P>
<P>SIMP. To this it is an$wered that the Air, in regard it is nei-
ther heavy nor light in its own Region, is di$po$ed with facility to
receive every impul$e, and al$o to retain the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. But if tho$e <I>penduli</I> even now named, did prove
unto us, that the moveable, the le$$e it had of gravity, the le$$e
apt it was to con$erve its motion, how can it be that the Air
which in the Air hath no gravity at all, doth of it $elf alone re-
tain the motion acquired? I believe, and know that you by this
time are of the $ame opinion, that the arm doth not $ooner re-
turn to re$t, than doth the circumambient Air. Let's go into the
Chamber, and with a towel let us agitate the Air as much as we
can, and then holding the cloth $till, let a little candle be
brought, that was lighted in the next room, or in the $ame place
let a leaf of beaten Gold be left at liberty to flie any wav, and you
$hall by the calm vagation of them be a$$ured that the Air is imme-
diately reduced to tranquilty. I could alledg many other experi-
ments to the $ame purpo$e, but if one of the$e $hould not $uf-
fice, I $hould think your folly altogether incurable.</P>
<P>SAGR. When an arrow is $hot again$t the Wind, how incredi-
ble a thing is it, that that $ame $mall filament of air, impelled by
the bow-$tring, $hould in de$pite of fate go along with the arrow?
But I would willingly know another particular of <I>Ari$totle,</I> to
which I intreat <I>Simplicius</I> would vouch$afe me an an$wer. Sup-
po$ing that with the $ame Bow there were $hot two arrows, one
ju$t after the u$ual manner, and the other $ide-wayes, placing it
long-wayes upon the Bow-$tring, and then letting it flie, I would
know which of them would go farthe$t. Favour me, I pray you
with an an$wer, though the que$tion may $eem to you rather
ridiculous than otherwi$e; and excu$e me, for that I, who am, as
you $ee, rather blocki$h, than not, can reach no higher with my
$peculative faculty.</P>
<P>SIMPL. I have never $een an arrow $hot in that manner, yet
neverthele$$e I believe, that it would not flie $ide-long, the
twentieth part of the $pace that it goeth end-wayes.</P>
<P>SAGR. And for that I am of the $ame opinion, hence it is, that
I have a doubt ri$en in me, whether <I>Aristotle</I> doth not contradict
experience. For as to experience, if I lay two arrows upon this
Table, in a time when a $trong Wind bloweth, one towards
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>134</p>
the cour$e of the wind, and the other $idelong, the wind will
quickly carry away this later, and leave the other where it was;
and the $ame to my $eeming, ought to happen, if the Doctrine of
<I>Ari$totle</I> were true, of tho$e two $hot out of a Bow: fora$much
as the arrow $hot $ideways is driven by a great quantity of Air,
moved by the bow$tring, to wit by as much as the $aid $tring is
long, whereas the other arrow receiveth no greater a quantity of
air, than the $mall circle of the $trings thickne$s. And I cannot
imagine what may be the rea$on of $uch a difference, but would
fain know the $ame.</P>
<P>SIMP. The cau$e $eemeth to me $ufficiently manife$t; and it
is, becau$e the arrow $hot endways, hath but a little quantity of
air to penetrate, and the other is to make its way through a quan-
tity as great as its whole length.</P>
<P>SALV. Then it $eems the arrows $hot, are to penetrate the air?
but if the air goeth along with them, yea, is that which carrieth
them, what penetration can they make therein? Do you not $ee
that, in this ca$e, the arrow would of nece$$ity move with greater
velocity than the air? and this greater velocity, what doth confer
it on the arrow? Will you $ay the air giveth them a velocity
greater than its own? Know then, <I>Simplicius,</I> that the bu$ine$s
proceeds quite contrary to that which <I>Ari$totle</I> $aith, and that the
<marg><I>The</I> medium <I>doth
impede and not cor-
fer the motion of
projects.</I></marg>
<I>medium</I> conferreth the motion on the project, is as fal$e, as it is
true, that it is the onely thing which procureth its ob$truction; and
having known this, you $hall under$tand without finding any thing
whereof to make que$tion, that if the air be really moved, it doth
much better carry the dart along with it longways, than endways,
for that the air which impelleth it in that po$ture, is much, and in
this very little. But $hooting with the Bow, fora$much as the air
$tands $till, the tran$ver$e arrow, being to force its pa$$age through
much air, comes to be much impeded, and the other that was nock't
ea$ily overcometh the ob$truction of the $mall quantity of air,
which oppo$eth it $elf thereto.</P>
<P>SALV. How many Propo$itions have I ob$erved in <I>Ari$totle,</I>
(meaning $till in Natural Philo$ophy) that are not onely fal$e,
but fal$e in $uch $ort, that its diametrical contrary is true, as it
happens in this ca$e. But pur$uing the point in hand, I think that
<I>Simplicius</I> is per$waded, that, from $eeing the $tone always to fall
in the $ame place, he cannot conjecture either the motion or $ta-
bility of the Ship: and if what hath been hitherto $poken,
$hould not $uffice, there is the Experiment of the <I>medium</I> which
may thorowly a$$ure us thereof; in which experiment, the mo$t
that could be $een would be, that the cadent moveable might be
left behind, if it were light, and that the air did not follow the
motion of the $hip: but in ca$e the air $hould move with equal
<foot>velocity,</foot>
<p n=>135</p>
velocity, no imaginable diver$ity could be found either in this,
or any other experiment what$oever, as I am anon to tell you.
Now if in this ca$e there appeareth no difference at all, what can
be pretended to be $een in the $tone falling from the top of the
Tower, where the motion in gyration is not adventitious, and ac-
cidental, but natural and eternal; and where the air exactly fol-
loweth the motion of the Tower, and the Tower that of the Ter-
re$trial Globe? have you any thing el$e to $ay, <I>Simplicius,</I> upon
this particular?</P>
<P>SIMP. No more but this, that I $ee not the mobility of the
Earth as yet proved.</P>
<P>SALV. Nor have I any intention at this time, but onely to
$hew, that nothing can be concluded from the experiments alledg-
ed by our adver$aries for convincing Arguments: as I think I
$hall prove the others to be.</P>
<P>SAGR. I be$eech you, <I>Salviatus,</I> before you proceed any far-
ther, to permit me to $tart certain que$tions, which have been
rouling in my fancy all the while that you with $o much patience
and equanimity, was minutely explaining to <I>Simplicius</I> the expe-
riment of the Ship.</P>
<P>SALV. We are here met with a purpo$e to di$pute, and it's fit
that every one $hould move the difficulties that he meets withall,
for this is the way to come to the knowledg of the truth.
Therefore $peak freely.</P>
<P>SAGR. If it be true, that the <I>impetus</I> wherewith the $hip moves,
doth remain indelibly impre$$'d in the $tone, after it is let fall from
the Ma$t; and if it be farther true, that this motion brings no im-
pediment or retardment to the motion directly downwards, na-
tural to the $tone: it's nece$$ary, that there do an effect en$ue of
<marg><I>An admirable
accident in the mo-
tion of projects.</I></marg>
a very wonderful nature. Let a Ship be $uppo$ed to $tand $till,
and let the time of the falling of a $tone from the Ma$ts Round-top
to the ground, be two beats of the pul$e; let the Ship afterwards
be under $ail, and let the $ame $tone depart from the $ame place,
and it, according to what hath been premi$ed, $hall $till take up
the time of two pul$es in its fall, in which time the $hip will have
run, $uppo$e, twenty yards; To that the true motion of the $tone
will be a tran$ver$e line, con$iderably longer than the fir$t $traight
and perpendicular line, which is the length of the ^{*} Ma$t, and yet
<marg>*By the length of
the ma$t he means
the di$tance be-
tween the upper-
deck and Round-
top.</marg>
neverthele$s the ^{*} $tone will have pa$t it in the $ame time. Let
it be farther $uppo$ed, that the Ships motion is much more accele-
rated, $o that the $tone in falling $hall be to pa$s a tran$ver$e line
much longer than the other; and in $um, increa$ing the Ships ve-
<marg>* La palla.</marg>
locity as much as you will, the falling $tone $hall de$cribe its tran$-
ver$e lines $till longer and longer, and yet $hall pa$s them all in
tho$e $elf $ame two pul$es. And in this fa$hion, if a Canon were
<foot>level'd</foot>
<p n=>136</p>
level'd on the top of a Tower, and $hots were made therewith
point blank, that is, paralel to the Horizon, let the Piece have a
greater or le$s charge, $o as that the ball may fall $ometimes a
thou$and yards di$tant, $ometimes four thou$and, $ometimes $ix,
$ometimes ten, <I>&amp;c.</I> and all the$e $hots $hall curry or fini$h their
ranges in times equal to each other, and every one equal to the
time which the ball would take to pa$s from the mouth of the
Piece to the ground, being left, without other impul$e, to fall
$imply downwards in a perpendicular line. Now it $eems a very
admirable thing, that in the $ame $hort time of its falling perpen-
dicularly down to the ground, from the height of, $uppo$e, an
hundred yards, the $ame ball, being thru$t violently out of the
Piece by the Fire, $hould be able to pa$s one while four hundred,
another while a thou$and, another while four, another while ten
thou$and yards, $o as that the $aid ball in all $hots made point
blank, always continueth an equal time in the air.</P>
<P>SALV. The con$ideration for its novelty is very pretty, and if
the effect be true, very admirable: and of the truth thereof, I
make no que$tion: and were it not for the accidental impediment
of the air, I verily believe, that, if at the time of the balls going
out of the Piece, another were let fall from the $ame height di-
rectly downwards, they would both come to the ground at the
$ame in$tant, though that $hould have curried ten thou$and
miles in its range, and this but an hundred onely: pre$uppo$ing
the $urface of the Earth to be equal, which to be a$$ured of, the
experiment may be made upon $ome lake. As for the impediment
which might come from the air, it would con$i$t in retarding the
extreme $wift motion of the $hot. Now, if you think fit, we will
proceed to the $olution of the other Objections, $eeing that <I>Sim-
plicius</I> (as far as I can $ee) is convinc'd of the nullity of this fir$t,
taken from things falling from on high downwards.</P>
<P>SIMP. I find not all my $cruples removed, but it may be the
fault is my own, as not being of $o ea$ie and quick an apprehen$ion
as <I>Sagredus.</I> And it $eems to me, that if this motion, of which
the $tone did partake whil$t it was on the Round-top of the Ships
Ma$t, be, as you $ay, to con$erve it $elf indelibly in the $aid $tone,
even after it is $eparated from the Ship, it would follow, that like-
wi$e in ca$e any one, riding a hor$e that was upon his $peed, $hould
let a bowl drop out of his hand, that bowl being fallen to the
ground would continue its motion and follow the hor$es $teps,
without tarrying behind him: the which effect, I believe, is not
to be $een, unle$s when he that is upon the hor$e $hould throw it
with violence that way towards which he runneth; but otherwi$e,
I believe it will $tay on the ground in the $ame place where it
fell.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>137</p>
<P>SALV. I believe that you very much deceive your $elf, and am
certain, that experience will $hew you the contrary, and that the ball
being once arrived at the ground, will run together with the hor$e,
not $taying behind him, unle$s $o far as the a$perity and uneven-
ne$s of the Earth $hall hinder it. And the rea$on $eems to me
very manife$t: for if you, $tanding $till, throw the $aid ball a-
long the ground, do you think it would not continue its motion
even after you had delivered it out of your hand? and that for $o
much a greater $pace, by how much the $uperficies were more
$mooth, $o that <I>v. g.</I> upon ice it would run a great way?</P>
<P>SIMP. There is no doubt of it, if I give it <I>impetus</I> with my
arm; but in the other ca$e it is $uppo$ed, that he who is upon the
hor$e, onely drops it out of his hand:</P>
<P>SALV. So I de$ire that it $hould be: but when you throw it
with your arm, what other remaineth to the ball being once gone
out of your hand, than the motion received from your arm, which
motion being con$erved in the boul, it doth continue to carry it
forward? Now, what doth it import, that that <I>impetus</I> be con-
ferred on the ball rather from the arm than from the hor$e? Whil$t
you were on hor$eback, did not your hand, and con$equently the
ball run as fa$t as the hor$e it $elf? Doubtle$s it did: therefore
in onely opening of the hand, the ball departs with the motion al-
ready conceived, not from your arm, by your particular motion,
but from the motion dependant on the $aid hor$e, which cometh to
be communicated to you, to your arm, to your hand, and la$tly to
the ball. Nay, I will tell you farther, that if the rider upon his
$peed fling the ball with his arm to the part contrary to the cour$e,
it $hall, after it is fallen to the ground, $ometimes (albeit thrown to
the contrary part) follow the cour$e of the hor$e, and $ometimes lie
$till on the ground; and $hall onely move contrary to the $aid
cour$e, when the motion received from the arm, $hall exceed that
of the carrier in velocity. And it is a vanity, that of $ome, who
$ay that a hor$eman is able to ca$t a javelin thorow the air, that
way which the hor$e runs, and with the hor$e to follow and over-
take the $ame; and la$tly, to catch it again. It is, I $ay, a vanity,
for that to make the project return into the hand, it is requi$ite to
ca$t it upwards, in the $ame manner as if you $tood $till. For, let
the carrier be never $o $wift, provided it be uniform, and the pro-
ject not over-light, it $hall always fall back again into the hand of
the projicient, though never $o high thrown.</P>
<P>SAGR. By this Doctrine I come to know $ome Problems very
<marg><I>Sundry curious
Problems, touch-
ing the motions of
projects.</I></marg>
curious upon this $ubject of projections; the fir$t of which mu$t
$eem very $trange to <I>Simplicius.</I> And the Problem is this; I af-
firm it to be po$$ible, that the ball being barely dropt or let fall,
by one that any way runneth very $wiftly, being arrived at the
<foot>S Earth,</foot>
<p n=>138</p>
Earth, doth not onely follow the cour$e of that per$on, but doth
much out go him. Which Problem is connexed with this, that
the moveable being thrown by the projicient above the plane of
the Horizon, may acquire new velocity, greater by far than that
confer'd upon it by the projicient. The which effect I have with
admiration ob$erved, in looking upon tho$e who u$e the $port of
tops, which, $o $oon as they are $et out of the hand, are $een to
move in the air with a certain velocity, the which they afterwards
much encrea$e at their coming to the ground; and if whipping
them, they rub at any uneven place that makes them skip on high,
they are $een to move very $lowly through the air, and falling a-
gain to the Earth, they $till come to move with a greater velocity:
But that which is yet more $trange, I have farther ob$erved, that
they not onely turn always more $wiftly on the ground, than in
the air, but of two $paces both upon the Earth, $ometimes a mo-
tion in the $econd $pace is more $wift than in the fir$t. Now what
would <I>Simplicius</I> $ay to this?</P>
<P>SIMP. He would $ay in the fir$t place, that he had never made
$uch an ob$ervation. Secondly, he would $ay, that he did not be-
lieve the $ame. He would $ay again, in the third place, that if
you could a$$ure him thereof, and demon$tratively convince him of
the $ame, he would account you a great D&aelig;mon.</P>
<P>SAGR. I hope then that it is one of the Socratick, not infernal
ones. But that I may make you under$tand this particular, you
mu$t know, that if a per$on apprehend not a truth of him$elf, it
is impo$$ible that others $hould make him under$tand it: I may in-
deed in$truct you in tho$e things which are neither true nor fal$e;
but the true, that is, the nece$$ary, namely, $uch as it is impo$$ible
$hould be otherwi$e, every common capacity either comprehendeth
them of him$elf, or el$e it is impo$$ible he $hould ever know them.
And of this opinion I am confident is <I>Salviatus</I> al$o: and there-
fore I tell you, that the rea$ons of the pre$ent Problems are known
by you, but it may be, not apprehended.</P>
<P>SIMP. Let us, for the pre$ent, pa$s by that controver$ie, and
permit me to plead ignorance of the$e things you $peak of, and try
whether you can make me capable of under$tanding the$e Pro-
blems.</P>
<P>SAGR. This fir$t dependeth upon another, which is, Whence
cometh it, that $etting a top with the la$h, it runneth farther, and
con$equently with greater force, than when its $et with the fin-
gers?</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Ari$totle</I> al$o makes certain Problems about the$e kinds
of projects.</P>
<P>SALV. He doth $o; and very ingenious they are: particular-
ly, That, Whence it cometh to pa$s that round tops run better than
the $quare?</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>139</p>
<P>SAGR. And cannot you, <I>Simplicius,</I> give a rea$on for this,
without others prompting you?</P>
<P>SIMP. Very good, I can $o; but leave your jeering.</P>
<P>SAGR. In like manner you do know the rea$on of this other
al$o. Tell me therefore; know you that a thing which moveth,
being impeded $tands $till?</P>
<P>SIMP. I know it doth, if the impediment be $o great as to
$uffice.</P>
<P>SAGR. Do you know, that moving upon the Earth is a greater
impediment to the moveable, than moving in the air, the Earth be-
ing rough and hard, and the air $oft and yielding?</P>
<P>SIMP. And knowing this, I know that the top will turn fa$ter
in the air, than on the ground, $o that my knowledg is quite con-
trary to what you think it.</P>
<P>SAGR. Fair and $oftly, <I>Simplicius.</I> You know that in the
parts of a moveable, that turneth about its centre, there are found
motions towards all $ides; $o that $ome a$cend, others de$cend;
$ome go forwards, others backwards?</P>
<P>SIMP. I know it, and <I>Aristotle</I> taught me the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. And with what demon$tration, I pray you?</P>
<P>SIMP. With that of $en$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. <I>Ari$totle,</I> then, hath made you $ee that which without
him you would not have $een? Did he ever lend you his eyes?
You would $ay, that <I>Ari$totle</I> hath told, adverti$ed, remembered
you of the $ame; and not taught you it. When then a top, with-
out changing place, turns round, (or in the childrens phra$e, $leep-
eth) not paralel, but erect to the Horizon, $ome of its parts a$cend,
and the oppo$ite de$cend; the $uperiour go one way, the infe-
riour another. Fancie now to your $elf, a top, that without chan-
ging place, $wiftly turns round in that manner, and $tands $u$pen-
ded in the air, and that in that manner turning, it be let fall to the
Earth perpendicularly, do you believe, that when it is arrived at
the ground, it will continue to turn round in the $ame manner,
without changing place, as before?</P>
<P>SIMP. No, Sir.</P>
<P>SAGR. What will it do then?</P>
<P>SIMP. It will run along the ground very fa$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. And towards what part?</P>
<P>SIMP. Towards that, whither its ^{*}reeling carrieth it.</P>
<marg>* Vertigine.</marg>
<P>SAGR. In its reeling there are parts, that is the uppermo$t, which
do move contrary to the inferiour; therefore you mu$t in$tance
which it $hall obey: for as to the parts a$cending and de$cending,
the one kind will not yield to the other; nor will they all go
downwards, being hindered by the Earth, nor upwards as being
heavy.</P>
<foot>2 3 SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>140</p>
<P>SIMP. The top will run reeling along the floor towards that
part whither its upper parts encline it.</P>
<P>SAGR. And why not whither the contrary parts tend, namely,
tho$e which touch the ground?</P>
<P>SIMP. Becau$e tho$e upon the ground happen to be impeded
by the roughne$s of the touch, that is, by the floors unevenne$s;
but the $uperiour, which are in the tenuous and flexible air, are
hindred very little, if at all; and therefore the top will obey their
inclination.</P>
<P>SAGR. So that that taction, if I may $o $ay, of the neither
parts on the floor, is the cau$e that they $tay, and onely the upper
parts $pring the top forward.</P>
<P>SALV. And therefore, if the top $hould fall upon the ice, or
other very $mooth $uperficies, it would not $o well run forward, but
might peradventure continue to revolve in it $elf, (or $leep) with-
out acquiring any progre$$ive motion.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is an ea$ie thing for it $o to do; but yet neverthe-
le$s, it would not $o $peedily come to $leep, as when it falleth on
a $uperficies $omewhat rugged. But tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> when
the top turning round about it $elf, in that manner, is let fall, why
doth it not move forwards in the air, as it doth afterwards when it
is upon the ground?</P>
<P>SIMP. Becau$e having air above it, and beneath, neither tho$e
parts, nor the$e have any where to touch, and not having more oc-
ca$ion to go forward than backward, it falls perpendicularly.</P>
<P>SAGR. So then the onely reeling about its $elf, without other
<I>impetus,</I> can drive the top forward, being arrived at the ground,
very nimbly. Now proceed we to what remains. That la$h,
which the driver tyeth to his Top-$tick, and with which, winding
it about the top, he $ets it (<I>i. e.</I> makes it go) what effect hath it on
the $aid top?</P>
<P>SIMP. It con$trains it to turn round upon its toe, that $o it may
free it $elf from the Top-la$h.</P>
<P>SAGR. So then, when the top arriveth at the ground, it cometh
all the way turning about its $elf, by means of the la$h. Hath it
not rea$on then to move in it $elf more $wiftly upon the ground,
than it did whil$t it was in the air?</P>
<P>SIMP. Yes doubtle$s; for in the air it had no other impul$e
than that of the arm of the projicient; and if it had al$o the reel-
ing, this (as hath been $aid) in the air drives it not forward at all:
but arriving at the floor, to the motion of the arm is added the
progre$$ion of the reeling, whereby the velocity is redoubled. And
I know already very well, that the top skipping from the ground,
its velocity will demini$h, becau$e the help of its circulation is
wanting; and returning to the Earth will get it again, and by that
<foot>means</foot>
<p n=>141</p>
means move again fa$ter, than in the air. It onely re$ts for me to
under$tand, whether in this $econd motion on the Earth it move
more $wiftly, than in the fir$t; for then it would move <I>in infini-
tum,</I> alwayes accelerating.</P>
<P>SAGR. I did not ab$olutely affirm, that this $econd motion is
more $wift than the fir$t; but that it may happen $o to be $ome-
times.</P>
<P>SIMP. This is that, which I apprehend not, and which I
de$ire to know.</P>
<P>SAGR. And this al$o you know of your $elf. Therefore tell
me: When you let the top fall out of your hand, without ma-
king it turn round (<I>i. e.</I> $etting it) what will it do at its coming to
the ground?</P>
<P>SIMP. Nothing, but there lie $till.</P>
<P>SAGR. May it not chance, that in its fall to the ground it may
acquire a motion? Think better on it.</P>
<P>SIMP. Unle$$e we let it fall upon $ome inclining $tone, as
children do playing at ^{*} <I>Chio$a,</I> and that falling $ide-wayes upon
<marg>* A Game in <I>Italy,</I>
which is, to glide
bullets down an
inclining $tone,
<I>&amp;c.</I></marg>
the $ame, it do acquire the motion of turning round upon its toe,
wherewith it afterwards continueth to move progre$$ively on the
floor, I know not in what other manner it can do any thing but
lie $till where it falleth.</P>
<P>SAGR. You $ee then that in $ome ca$e it may acquire a new
revolution. When then the top jerked up from the ground, falleth
down again, why may it not ca$ually hit upon the declivity of
$ome $tone fixed in the floor, and that hath an inclination that
way towards which it moveth, and acquiring by that $lip a new
whirle over and above that conferred by the la$h, why may it
not redouble its motion, and make it $wifter than it was at its
fir$t lighting upon the ground?</P>
<P>SIMP. Now I $ee that the $ame may ea$ily happen. And I
am thinking that if the top $hould turn the contrary way, in ar-
riving at the ground, it would work a contrary effect, that is,
the motion of the accidental whirl would retard that of the pro-
jicient.</P>
<P>SAGR. And it would $ometimes wholly retard and $top it, in
ca$e the revolution of the top were very $wift. And from hence a-
ri$eth the re$olution of that $light, which the more skilful Tennis
Players u$e to their advantage; that is, to gull their adver$ary by
cutting (for $o is their Phra$e) the Ball; which is, to return it
with a $ide Rachet, in $uch a manner, that it doth thereby ac-
quire a motion by it $elf contrary to the projected motion, and $o
by that means, at its coming to the ground, the rebound, which
if the ball did not turn in that manner, would be towards the
adver$ary, giving him the u$ual time to to$$e it back again, doth
<foot>fail,</foot>
<p n=>142</p>
fail, and the ball runs tripping along the ground, or rebounds le$$e
than u$ual, and breaketh the time of the return. Hence it is
<marg>*A Game in <I>Italy,</I>
wherein they $trive
who $hall trundle
or throw a wooden
bowle neere$t to an
a$$igned mark.</marg>
that you $ee, tho$e who play at ^{*} Stool-ball, when they play in
a $tony way, or a place full of. holes and rubs that make the ball
trip an hundred $everal wayes, never $uffering it to come neer the
mark, to avoid them all, they do not trundle the ball upon the
ground, but throw it, as if they were to pitch a quait. But be-
cau$e in throwing the ball, it i$$ueth out of the hand with $ome
roling conferred by the fingers, when ever the hand is under the
ball, as it is mo$t commonly held; whereupon the ball in its lighting
on the ground neer to the mark, between the motion of the pro-
jicient and that of the roling, would run a great way from the
$ame: To make the ball $tay, they hold it artificially, with their
hand uppermo$t, and it undermo$t, which in its delivery hath
a contrary twirl or roling conferred upon it by the fingers, by
means whereof in its coming to the ground neer the mark it $tays
there, or runs very very little forwards. But to return to our
principal problem which gave occa$ion for $tarting the$e others; I
$ay it is po$$ible that a per$on carried very $wiftly, may let a ball
drop out of his hand, that being come to the Earth, $hall not
onely follow his motion, but al$o out-go it, moving with a great-
er velocity. And to $ee $uch an effect, I de$ire that the cour$e
may be that of a Chariot, to which on the out-$ide let a decli-
ning board be fa$tened; $o as that the neither part may be towards
the hor$es, and the upper towards the hind Wheel. Now, if in
the Chariots full career, a man within it, let a ball fall gliding a-
long the declivity of that board, it $hall in roling downward ac-
quire a particular <I>vertigo</I> or turning, the which added to the
motion impre$$ed by the Chariot, will carrie the ball along the
ground much fa$ter than the Chariot. And if one accommodate
another declining board over again$t it, the motion of the Cha-
riot may be qualified $o, that the ball, gliding downwards along
the board, in its coming to the ground $hall re$t immoveable,
and al$o $hall $ometimes run the contrary way to the Chariot. But
we are $trayed too far from the purpo$e, therefore if <I>Simplicius</I>
be $atisfied with the re$olution of the fir$t argnment again$t the
Earths mobility, taken from things falling perpendicularly, we
may pa$$e to the re$t</P>
<P>SALV. The digre$$ions made hitherto, are not $o alienated
from the matter in hand, as that one can $ay they are wholly
$trangers to it. Be$ides the$e argumentations depend on tho$e
things that $tart up in the fancy not of one per$on, but of three,
that we are: And moreover we di$cour$e for our plea$ure, nor
are we obliged to that $trictne$$e of one who <I>ex profe$$o</I> treateth
methodically of an argument, with an intent to publi$h the $ame.

much liberry as if we were met to tell $tories, it $hall be lawful
for me to $peak, what ever your di$cour$e brings into my mind.</P>
<P>SAGR. I like this motion very well; and $ince we are at this
liberty, let me take leave, before we pa$$e any farther to ask of
you <I>Salviatus,</I> whether you did ever con$ider what that line may
be that is de$cribed by the grave moveable naturally falling down
from the top of a Tower; and if you have reflected on it, be
plea$ed to tell me what you think thereof.</P>
<P>SALV. I have $ometimes con$idered of it, and make no que-
$tion, that if one could be certain of the nature of that motion
wherewith the grave body de$cendeth to approach the centre of
the Terre$trial Globe, mixing it $elf afterwards with the common
circular motion of the diurnal conver$ion; it might be exactly
found what kind of line that is, that the centre of gravity of the
moveable de$cribeth in tho$e two motions.</P>
<P>SAGR. Touching the $imple motion towards the centre de-
pendent on the gravity, I think that one may confidently, with-
out error, believe that it is by a right line, as it would be, were
the Earth immoveable.</P>
<P>SALV. As to this particular, we may not onely believe it, but
experience rendereth us certain of the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. But how doth experience a$$ure us thereof, if we ne-
ver $ee any motions but $uch as are compo$ed of the two, circular
and de$cending.</P>
<P>SALV. Nay rather <I>Sagredus</I> we onely $ee the $imple motion of
de$cent; $ince that other circular one common to the Earth, the
Tower and our $elves remains imperceptible, and as if it never
were, and there remaineth perceptible to us that of the $tone, one-
ly not participated by us, and for this, $en$e demon$trateth that
it is by a right line, ever parallel to the $aid Tower, which is
built upright and perpendicular upon the Terre$trial $urface.</P>
<P>SAGR. You are in the right; and this was but too plainly de-
mon$trated to me even now, $eeing that I could not remember $o
ea$ie a thing; but this being $o manife$t, what more is it that you
$ay you de$ire, for under$tanding the nature of this motion
downwards?</P>
<P>SALV. It $ufficeth not to know that it is $treight, but its requi-
$ite to know whether it be uniform, or irregular; that is, whe-
ther it maintain alwayes one and the $ame velocity, or el$e goeth
retarding or accelerating.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is already clear, that it goeth continually accelle-
rating.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>144</p>
<P>SALV. Neither doth this $uffice, but its requi$ite to know ac-
cording to what proportion $uch accelleration is made; a Pro-
blem, that I believe was never hitherto under$tood by any Phi-
lo$opher or Mathematician; although Philo$ophers, and particu-
larly the <I>Peripateticks,</I> have writ great and entire Volumes,
touching motion.</P>
<P>SIMP. Philo$ophers principally bu$ie them$elves about univer-
$als; they find the definitions and more common $ymptomes, o-
mitting certain $ubtilties and niceties, which are rather curio-
$ities to the Mathematicians. And <I>Aristotle</I> did content him$elf
to de$ine excellently what motion was in general; and of the lo-
cal, to $hew the principal qualities, to wit, that one is natural,
another violent; one is $imple, another compound; one is
equal, another accellerate; and concerning the accelerate, con-
tents him$elf to give the rea$on of acceleration, remitting the
finding out of the proportion of $uch acceleration, and other
particular accidents to the Mechanitian, or other inferiour
Arti$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. Very well <I>Simplicius.</I> But you <I>Salviatus,</I> when you
de$cend $ometimes from the Throne of <I>Peripatetick</I> Maje$ty,
have you ever thrown away any of your hours in $tudying to find
this proportion of the acceleration of the motion of de$cending
grave bodies?</P>
<P>SALV. There was no need that I $hould $tudy for it, in regard
that the Academick our common friend, heretofore $hewed me a
Treati$e of his ^{*} <I>De Motu,</I> where this, and many other acci-
<marg>This is that ex-
cellent tract which
we give the fir$t
place in our $econd
Volume.</marg>
dents were demon$trated. But it would be too great a digre$$ion,
if for this particular, we $hould interrupt our pre$ent di$cour$e,
(which yet it $elf is al$o no better than a digre$$ion) and make as
the Saying is, a Comedy within a Comedy.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am content to excu$e you from this narration for the
pre$ent, provided that this may be one of the Propo$itions re$er-
ved to be examined among$t the re$t in another particular meeting,
for that the knowledg thereof is by me very much de$ired; and
in the mean time let us return to the line de$cribed by the grave
body in its fall from the top of the Tower to its ba$e.</P>
<P>SALV. If the right motion towards the centre of the Earth was
uniforme, the circular towards the Ea$t being al$o uniforme, you
would $ee compo$ed of them both a motion by a $piral line, of
that kind with tho$e defined by <I>Archimedes</I> in his Book <I>Dc Spira-
libus</I>; which are, when a point moveth uniformly upon a right
line, while$t that line in the mean time turneth uniformly about
one of its extreme points fixed, as the centre of his gyration.
But becau$e the right motion of grave bodies falling, is continu-
ally accelerated, it is nece$$ary, that the line re$ulting of the
<foot>com-</foot>
<p n=>145</p>
compo$ition of the two motions do go alwayes receding with
greater and greater proportion from the circumference of that cir-
cle, which the centre of the $tones gravity would have de$igned,
if it had alwayes $taid upon the Tower; it followeth of nece$$ity
that this rece$$ion at the fir$t be but little, yea very $inall, yea,
more, as $mall as can be imagined, $eeing that the de$cending
grave body departing from re$t, that is, from the privation of
motion, towards the bottom and entring into the right motion
downwards, it mu$t needs pa$$e through all the degrees of tardi-
ty, that are betwixt re$t, and any a$$igned velocity; the which
degrees are infinite; as already hath been at large di$cour$ed and
proved.</P>
<P>It being $uppo$ed therefore, that the progre$$e of the accele-
ration being after this manner, and it being moreover true, that
the de$cending grave body goeth to terminate in the centre of the
Earth, it is nece$$ary that the line of its mixt motion be $uch, that
<marg><I>The line de$cri-
bed by a moveable

$cent, the motion
of the Earth a-
bout its own centre
being pre$uppo$ed,
would probably be
the circumference
of a circle.</I></marg>
it go continually receding with greater and greater proportion
from the top of the Tower, or to $peak more properly, from
the circumference of the circle de$cribed by the top of the Tower,
by means of the Earths conver$ion; but that $uch rece$$ions be
le$$er and le$$er <I>in infinitum</I>; by how much the moveable finds it
$elf to be le$$e and le$$e removed from the fir$t term where it
re$ted. Moreover it is nece$$ary, that this line of the compound-
ed motion do go to terminate in the centre of the Earth. Now
having pre$uppo$ed the$e two things, I come to de$cribe about
the centre A [<I>in Fig. 1. of this $econd Dialogue</I>;] with the $emi-
diameter A B, the circle B I, repre$enting to me the Terre$trial
Globe, and prolonging the $emidiameter A B to C, I have de-
$cribed the height of the Tower B C; the which being carried
about by the Earth along the circumference B I, de$cribeth with
its top the arch C D: Dividing, in the next place, the line C A
in the middle at E; upon the centre E, at the di$tance E C, I de-
$cribe the $emicircle C I A: In which, I now affirm, that it is very
probable that a $tone falling from the top of the Tower C, doth
move, with a motion mixt of the circular, which is in common,
and of its peculiar right motion. If therefore in the circumference
C D, certain equal parts C F, F G, G H, H L, be marked, and
from the points F, G, H, L, right lines be drawn towards the
centre A, the parts of them intercepted between the two cir-
cumferences C D and B I, $hall repre$ent unto us the $ame
Tower C B, tran$ported by the Terre$trial Globe towards D I;
in which lines the points where they come to be inter$ected by the
arch of the $emicircle C I, are the places by whichfrom time to
time the falling $tone doth pa$$e; which points go continually
with greater and greater proportion receding from the top of the
<foot>T Tower.</foot>
<p n=>146</p>
Tower. And this is the cau$e why the right motion made along
the $ide of the Tower appeareth to us more and more accelerate.
It appeareth al$o, how by rea$on of the infinite acutene$$e of
the contact of tho$e two circles D C, C I, the rece$$ion of the
cadent moveable from the circumference C F D; namely, from
the top of the Tower, is towards the beginning extream $mall,
which is as much as if one $aid its motion downwards is very $low,
and more and more $low <I>in infinitum,</I> according to its vicinity to
the term C, that is to the $tate of re$t. And la$tly it is $een how
in the end this $ame motion goeth to terminate in the centre of the
Earth A.</P>
<P>SAGR. I under$tand all this very well, nor can I per$wade my
$elf that the falling moveable doth de$cribe with the centre of its
gravity any other line, but $uch an one as this.</P>
<P>SALV. But $tay a little <I>Sagredus,</I> for I am to acquaint you
al$o with three Ob$ervations of mine, that its po$$ible will not di$-
<marg><I>A moveable fal-
ting from the top of
the Tower, moveth
in the circumfe-
rence of a circle.</I></marg>
plea$e you. The fir$t of which is, that if we do well con$ider, the
moveable moveth not really with any more than onely one motion
$imply circular, as when being placed upon the Tower, it moved
with one $ingle and circular motion. The $econd is yet more plea-
<marg><I>It moveth neither
more nor le$$e, than
if it had $taid al-
wayes there.</I></marg>
$ant; for, it moveth neither more nor le$$e then if it had $taid con-
tinually upon the Tower, being that to the arches C F, F G, G H,
&amp;c. that it would have pa$$ed continuing alwayes upon the Tower,
the arches of the circumference C I are exactly equal, an$wering
under the $ame C F, F G, G H, &amp;c. Whence followeth the third
<marg><I>It moveth with
an uniform, not
an accelerate mo-
tion.</I></marg>
wonder, That the true and real motion of the $tone is never acce-
lerated, but alwayes even and uniforme, $ince that all the equal ar-
ches noted in the circumference C D, and their re$pondent ones
marked in the circumference C I, are pa$t in equal times; $o that
we are left at liberty to $eek new cau$es of acceleration, or of o-
ther motions, $eeing that the moveable, as well $tanding upon the
Tower, as de$cending thence, alwayes moveth in the $ame fa$hion,
that is, circularly, with the $ame velocity, and with the $ame uni-
formity. Now tell me what you think of this my fanta$tical con-
jecture.</P>
<P>SAGR. I mu$t tell you, that I cannot with words $ufficiently
expre$$e how admirable it $eemeth to me; and for what at pre-
$ent offereth it $elf to my under$tanding, I cannot think that the
bu$ine$s happeneth otherwi$e; and would to God that all the
demon$trations of Philo$ophers were but half $o probable as this.
However for my perfect $atisfaction I would gladly hear how you
prove tho$e arches to be equal.</P>
<P>SALV. The demon$tration is mo$t ea$ie. Suppo$e to your $elf
a line drawn from I to E. And the Semidiameter of the circle CD,
that is, the line C A, being double the Semidiameter C E of the
<foot>cir-</foot>
<p n=>147</p>
circle C I, the circumference $hall be double to the circumference,
and every arch of the greater circle double to every like arch of
the le$$er; and con$equently, the half of the arch of the greater
circle, equal to the whole arch of the le$$e. And becau$e the an-
gle C E I made in the centre E of the le$$er circle, and which in$i-
$teth upon the arch C I, is double the angle C A D, made in the
centre A of the greater circle, to which the arch C D $ubtendeth;
therefore the arch C D is half of the arch of the greater circle like
to the arch C I, and therefore the two arches C D and C I are e-
qual; and in the $ame manner we may demon$trate of all their
parts. But that the bu$ine$s, as to the motion of de$cending grave
bodies, proceedeth exactly thus, I will not at this time affirm; but
this I will $ay, that if the line de$cribed by the cadent moveable
be not exactly the $ame with this, it doth extream neerly re$emble
the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. But I, <I>Salviatus,</I> am ju$t now con$idering another par-
<marg><I>Right motion

cluded in nature.</I></marg>
ticular very admirable; and this it is; That admitting the$e con-
$iderations, the right motion doth go wholly ^{*} mounting, and that
<marg>* Vadia del tutto a

Nature never makes u$e thereof, $ince that, even that that u$e,
which was from the beginning granted to it, which was of redu-
cing the parts of integral bodies to their place, when they were
$eparated from their whole, and therefore con$tituted in a depra-
ved di$po$ition, is taken from it, and a$$igned to the circular
motion.</P>
<P>SALV. This would nece$$arily follow, if it were concluded
that the Terre$trial Globe moveth circularly; a thing, which I
pretend not to be done, but have onely hitherto attempted, as I
$hall $till, to examine the $trength of tho$e rea$ons, which have
been alledged by Philo$ophers to prove the immobility of the
Earth, of which this fir$t taken from things falling perpendicu-
larly, hath begat the doubts, that have been mentioned; which
I know not of what force they may have $eemed to <I>Simplicius</I>;
and therefore before I pa$$e to the examination of the remaining
arguments, it would be convenient that he produce what he hath
to reply to the contrary.</P>
<P>SIMP. As to this fir$t, I confe$$e indeed that I have heard
$undry pretty notions, which I never thought upon before, and
in regard they are new unto me, I cannot have an$wers $o ready
for them, but this argument taken from things falling perpendi-
cularly, I e$teem it not one of the $tronge$t proofs of the mobi-
lity of the Earth; and I know not what may happen touching the
$hots of great Guns, e$pecially tho$e aimed contrary to the diur-
nal motion.</P>
<P>SAGR. The flying of the birds as much puzzleth me as the
objection of the Gun-$hot, and all the other experiments above
<foot>T 2 al-</foot>
<p n=>148</p>
alledged. For the$e birds which at their plea$ure flie for-
wards and backwards, and wind to and again in a thou$and
fa$hions, and, which more importeth, lie whole hours upon the
wing, the$e I $ay do not a little po$e me, nor do I $ee, how a-
mong$t $o many circumgyrations, they $hould not lo$e the motion
of the Earth, and how they $hould be able to keep pace with
$o great a velocity as that which they $o far exceed with their flight.</P>
<P>SALV. To $peak the truth, your $cruple is not without rea$on,
and its po$$ible <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf could not find an an$wer for it,
that was to him$elf entirely $atisfactory; and therefore haply pa$t
it over in $ilence albeit he was, indeed, very brief in examining
the other allegations of his adver$aries, I believe through his
height of wit, placed on greater aud $ublimer contemplations,
like as Lions are not much moved at the barking of little Dogs.
We will therefore re$erve the in$tance of birds to the la$t place,
and for the pre$ent, $ee if we can give <I>Simplicius</I> $atisfaction in
the others, by $hewing him in our wonted manner, that he him-
$elf hath their an$wers at hand, though upon fir$t thoughts he doth
not di$cover them. And to begin with the $hots made at randome,
with the $elf $ame piece, powder, and ball, the one towards the Ea$t,
the other towards the We$t, let him tell me what it is that per$wades
him to think that the Range towards the We$t (if the diurnal con-
ver$ion belonged to the Earth) ought to be much longer than that
towards the Ea$t.</P>
<marg><I>The rea$on why
a Gun $hould $iem
to carry farther to-
wards the We$t
than towards the
Ea$t.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. I am moved $o to think; becau$e in the $hot made to-
wards the Ea$t, the ball whil'$t it is out of the piece, is follow-
ed by the $aid piece, the which being carried round by the Earth,
runneth al$o with much velocity towards the $ame part, where-
upon the fall of the ball to the ground, cometh to be but little
di$tant from the piece. On the contrary in the $hot towards the
We$t, before that the ball falleth to the ground, the piece is re-
tired very far towards the Ea$t, by which means the $pace be-
tween the ball and the piece, that is Range, will appear longer
than the other, by how much the piece, that is the Earth, had
run in the time that both the bals were in the air.</P>
<P>SALV. I could wi$h, that we did know $ome way to make an
experiment corre$ponding to the motion of the$e projects, as that
of the $hip doth to the motion of things perpendicularly falling
from on high; and I am thinking how it may be done.</P>
<marg><I>The experiment
of a running cha-

<P>SAGR. I believe, that it would be a very oppo$ite proof, to
take an open Chariot, and to accomodate therein a ^{*}Stock-bow
at half elevation, to the end the flight may prove the greate$t
<marg>* Bale$trone da bol-
zoni.</marg>
that my be, and whil'$t the hor$es $hall run, to $hoot fir$t towards
the part whither you drive, and then another backwards towards
the contrary part, cau$ing $ome one to mark diligently where
the Chariot was in that moment f time when the $haft came to
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>149</p>
the ground, as well in the one $hot as in the other: for thus you
may $ee exactly how much one $haft flew farther than the other.</P>
<P>SIMP. In my thoughts this experiment is very proper: and I
do not doubt but that the flight, that is, the $pace between the
$haft and the place where the chariot was at the $hafts fall, will be
le$s by much when one $hooteth towards the chariots cour$e, than
when one $hooteth the contrary way. For an example, let the
flight of it $elf be three hundred yards, and the cour$e of the cha-
riot in the time whil$t the $haft $tayeth in the air, an hundred
yards, therefore $hooting towards the cour$e, of the three hundred
yards of the flight, the chariot will have gone one hundred; $o
then at the $hafts coming to the ground, the $pace between it and
the chariot, $hall be but two hundred yards onely; but on the
contrary, in the other $hoot, the chariot running contrary to the
$haft, when the $haft $hall have pa$$ed its three hundred yards, and
the chariot its other hundred the contrary way, the di$tance inter-
po$ing $hall be found to be four hundred yards.</P>
<P>SALV. Is there any way to $hoot $o that the$e flights may be
equal?</P>
<P>SIMP. I know no other way, unle$s by making the chariot to
$tand $till.</P>
<P>SALV. This we know; but I mean when the chariot runneth
in full carreer.</P>
<P>SIMP. In that ca$e you are to draw the Bow higher in $hoot-
ing forwards, and to $lack it in $hooting the contrary way.</P>
<P>SALV. Then you $ee that there is one way more. But how
much is the bow to be drawn, and how much $lackened?</P>
<P>SIMP. In our ca$e, where we have $uppo$ed that the bow car-
ried three hundred yards, it would be requi$ite to draw it $o, as
that it might carry four hundred, and in the other to $lacken it $o,
as that it might carry no more than two hundred. For $o each
of the flights would be but three hundred in relation to the chariot,
the which, with its cour$e of an hundred yards which it $ub$tracts
from the $hoot of four hundred, and addeth to that of two hun-
dred, would reduce them both to three hundred.</P>
<P>SALV. But what effect hath the greater or le$s inten$ne$s of the
bow upon the $haft?</P>
<P>SIMP. The $tiffer bow carrieth it with greater velocity, and the
weaker with le$s; and the $ame $haft flieth $o much farther at one
time than another, with how much greater velocity it goeth out of
the tiller at one time, than another.</P>
<P>SALV. So that to make the $haft $hot either way, to flie at e-
qual di$tance from the running chariot, it is requi$ite, that if in the
fir$t $hoot of the precedent example, it goeth out of the tiller with
<I>v. g.</I> four degrees of velocity, that then in the other $hoot it de-
<foot>part</foot>
<p n=>150</p>
part but with two onely: but if the $ame bow be u$ed, it always
receiveth thence three degrees.</P>
<P>SIMP. It doth $o; and for this rea$on, $hooting with the
$ame bow in the chariots cour$e, the $hoots cannot be equal.</P>
<P>SALV. I had forgot to ask, with what velocity it is $uppo$ed in
this particular experiment, that the chariot runneth.</P>
<P>SIMP. The velocity of the chariot mu$t be $uppo$ed to be one
degree in compari$on to that of the bow, which is three,</P>
<P>SALV. Very right, for $o computation gives it. But tell me,
when the chariot moveth, doth not all things in the $ame move
with the $ame velocity?</P>
<P>SIMP. Yes doubtle$s.</P>
<P>SALV. Then $o doth the $haft al$o, and the bow, and the $tring,
upon which the $haft is nock't.</P>
<P>SIMP. They do $o.</P>
<P>SALV. Why then, in di$charging the $haft towards the cour$e
of the chariot, the bow impre$$eth its three degrees of velocity on
a $haft that had one degree of velocity before, by means of the
chariot which tran$ported it $o fa$t towards that part; $o that in
its going off it hath four degrees of velocity. On the contrary,
in the other $hoot, the $ame bow conferreth its $ame three degrees
of velocity on a $haft that moveth the contrary way, with one de-
gree; $o that in its departing from the bow-$tring, it hath no more
left but onely two degrees of velocity. But you your $elf have
already $aid, that the way to make the $hoots equal, is to cau$e
that the $haft be let flie the fir$t time with four degrees of velocity,
and the $econd time with two. Therefore without changing the
bow, the very cour$e of the chariot is that which adju$teth the
<marg><I>The $olution of
the argument ta-
ken from great-
Guns $hot towards
the East &amp; We$t.</I></marg>
flights, and the experiment doth $o repre$ent them to any one who
is not either wilfully or naturally incapable of rea$on. Now
apply this di$cour$e to Gunnery, and you $hall find, that whether the
Earth move or $tand $till, the $hots made with the $ame force, will
always curry equal ranges, to what part $oever aimed. The error
of <I>Ari$totle, Ptolomey, Iycho,</I> your $elf, and all the re$t, is ground-
ed upon that fixed and $trong per$ua$ion, that the Earth $tandeth
$till, which you have not judgment nor power to depo$e, no not
when you have a de$ire to argue of that which would en$ue, pre-
$uppo$ing the Earth to move. And thus, in the other argument,
not con$idering that whil'$t the $tone is upon the Tower, it doth,
as to moving or not moving, the $ame that the Terre$trial Globe
doth, becau$e you have concluded with your $elf, that the Earth
$tands $till, you always di$cour$e touching the fall of the $tone, as
if it were to depart from re$t: whereas it behooveth to $ay, that
if the Earth $tandeth $till, the $tone departeth from re$t, and de-
$cendeth perpendicularly; but if the Earth do move, the $tone
<foot>likewi$e</foot>
<p n=>151</p>
likewi$e moveth with like velocity, nor doth it depart from re$t,
but from a motion equal to that of the Earth, wherewith it inter-
mixeth the $upervenient motion of de$cent, and of tho$e two com-
po$eth a third which is tran$ver$al or $ide-ways.</P>
<P>SIMP. But for Gods $ake, if it move tran$ver$ly, how is it that
I behold it to move directly and perpendicularly? This is no bet-
ter than the denial of manife$t $en$e; and if we may not believe
$en$e, at what other door $hall we enter into di$qui$itions of Philo-
$ophy?</P>
<P>SALV. In re$pect to the Earth, to the Tower, and to our $elves,
which all as one piece move with the diurnal motion together with
the $tone, the diurnal motion is as if it never had been, and becom-
eth in$en$ible, imperceptible, and without any action at all; and
the onely motion which we can perceive, is that of which we par-
take not, that is the de$cent gliding along the $ide of the Tower:
You are not the fir$t that hath felt great repugnance in apprehen-
ding this non-operating of motion upon things to which it is com-
mon.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now I do remember a certain conceipt, that came one

day into my fancy, whil$t I $ailed in my voyage to <I>Aleppo,</I> whither
I went Con$ul for our Countrey, and po$$ibly it may be of $ome
u$e, for explaining this nullity of operation of common motion,
and being as if it never were to all the partakers thereof. And if
it $tand with the good liking of <I>Simplicius,</I> I will rea$on with
him upon that which then I thought of by my $elf alone.</P>

as the ve$$el had gone more or le$s fluctuating; but this its infle-
cting in $ome places a fathom or two to the right hand or to the
left, upwards or downwards, in a length of many hundred miles,
would have brought but little alteration to the intire tract of the
line, $o that it would have been hardly $en$ible; and without any
con$iderable error, might have been called the part of a perfect
arch.</P>
<P>SAGR. So that the true and mo$t exact motion of the neb of
my pen would have al$o been an arch of a perfect circle, if the
ve$$els motion, the fluctuation of the billows cea$ing, had been
<foot>calm</foot>
<p n=>152</p>
calm and tranquill. And if I had continually held that pen in
my hand, and had onely moved it $ometimes an inch or two this
way or that way, what alteration $hould I have made in that its
principal, and very long tract or $troke?</P>
<P>SIMP. Le$s than that which the declining in $everal places from
ab$olute rectitude, but the quantity of a flea's eye makes in a right
line of a thou$and yards long.</P>
<P>SAGR. If a Painter, then, at our launching from the Port, had
began to de$ign upon a paper with that pen, and continued his
work till he came to <I>Scanderon,</I> he would have been able to have
taken by its motion a perfect draught of all tho$e figures perfectly
interwoven and $hadowed on $everal $ides with countreys, build-
ings, living creatures, and other things; albeit all the true, real,
and e$$ential motion traced out by the neb of that pen, would
have been no other than a very long, but $imple line: and as to
the proper operation of the Painter, he would have delineated the
$ame to an hair, if the $hip had $tood $till. That therefore of the
huge long motion of the pen there doth remain no other marks,
than tho$e tracks drawn upon the paper, the rea$on thereof is be-
cau$e the grand motion from <I>Venice</I> to <I>Scanderon,</I> was common to
the paper, the pen, and all that which was in the $hip: but the petty
motions forwards and backwards, to the right, to the left, com-
municated by the fingers of the Painter unto the pen, and not to
the paper, as being peculiar thereunto, might leave marks of it $elf
upon the paper, which did not move with that motion. Thus it
is likewi$e true, that the Earth moving, the motion of the $tone in
de$cending downwards, was really a long tract of many hundreds
and thou$ands of yards, and if it could have been able to have de-
lineated in a calm air, or other $uperficies, the track of its cour$e,
it would have left behind an huge long tran$ver$e line. But that
part of all this motion which is common to the $tone, the Tower,
and our $elves, is imperceptible to us, and as if it had never been,
and that part onely remaineth ob$ervable, of which neither the
Tower nor we are partakers, which is in fine, that wherewith the
$tone falling mea$ureth the Tower.</P>
<P>SALV. A mo$t witty conceipt to clear up this point, which was
not a little difficult to many capacities. Now if <I>Simplicius</I> will
make no farther reply, we may pa$s to the other experiments, the
unfolding of which will receive no $mall facility from the things
already declared.</P>
<P>SIMP. I have nothing more to $ay: and I was well-nigh tran$-
ported with that delineation, and with thinking how tho$e $trokes
drawn $o many ways, hither, thither, upwards, downwards, for-
wards, backwards, and interwoven with thou$ands of turnings, are
not e$$entially or really other, than $mall pieces of one $ole line
<foot>drawn</foot>
<p n=>153</p>
drawn all one way, and the $ame without any other alteration $ave
the declining the direct rectitude, $ometimes a very in$en$ible mat-
ter towards one $ide or another, and the pens moving its neb one
while $ofter, another while $lower, but with very $mall inequality.
And I think that it would in the $ame manner write a letter, and
that tho$e frollike penmen, who to $hew their command of hand,
without taking their pen from the paper in one $ole $troke, with
infinite turnings draw a plea$ant knot, if they were in a boat that
did tide it along $wiftly they would convert the whole motion
of the pen, which in reality is but one $ole line, drawn all towards
one and the $ame part, and very little curved, or declining from
perfect rectitude, into a knot or flouri$h. And I am much plea$ed
that <I>S agredus</I> hath helped me to this conceit: therefore let us go
on, for the hope of meeting with more of them, will make me the
$tricter in my attention.</P>

witty conceit which I met with likewi$e in the $ame voyage, when I
ob$erved that the ma$t of the $hip, without either breaking or bend-
ing, had made a greater voyage with its round-top, that is with its
top-gallant, than with its foot; for the round top being more di$tant
from the centre of the Earth than the foot is, it had de$cribed the
arch of a circle bigger than the circle by which the foot had pa$$ed.</P>

<P>SAGR. You have found out the matter your $elf by help of

<P>SALV. It plea$eth me to $ee <I>Simplicius</I> how he $ootheth up
him$elf in this conceit, if happly it be his own, and that he hath not
borrowed it from a certain little pamphlet of conclu$ions, where
there are a great many more $uch fancies no le$s plea$ant &amp; witty.
It followeth that we $peak of the peice of Ordinance mounted per-

unto the $ame peice, though that in the long time which it is $e-
parated from the peice, the earth hath tran$ported it many miles
towards the Ea$t; now it $eemeth, that the ball ought to fall a like

happen: therefore the peice without having been moved did $tay

$tone falling from the Tower; and all the fallacy, and equivocati-

for the Opponent hath it $till fixed in his conceit that the
ball departs from its re$t, being di$charged by the fire
<foot>V from</foot>
<p n=>154</p>
from the piece; and the departing from the $tate of re$t, cannot
be, unle$$e the immobility of the Terre$trial Globe be pre$uppo-
$ed, which is the conclu$ion of that was in di$pute; Therefore,
I reply, that tho$e who make the Earth moveable, an$wer, that
the piece, and the ball that is in it, partake of the $ame motion
with the Earth; nay that they have this together with her from
nature; and that therefore the ball departs in no other manner
from its quie$cence, but conjoyned with its motion about the cen-
tre, the which by its projection upwards, is neither taken away,
nor hindered; and in this manner following, the univer$al motion
of the Earth towards the Ea$t, it alwayes keepeth perpendicular
over the $aid piece, as well in its ri$e as in its return. And the
$ame you $ee to en$ue, in making the experiment in a $hip with
a bullet $hot upwards perpendicularly with a Cro$$e-bow, which
returneth to the $ame place whether the $hip doth move, or $tand
$till.</P>
<marg><I>Another an$wer
to the $ame objecti-
on.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. This $atisfieth very well to all; but becau$e that I have
$een that <I>Simplicius</I> taketh plea$ure with certain $ubtilties to
puzzle his companions, I will demand of him whether, $uppo-
$ing for this time that the Earth $tandeth $till, and the piece ere-
cted upon it perpendicularly, directed to our Zenith, he do at all
que$tion that to be the true perpendicular $hot, and that the ball
in departing, and in its return is to go by the $ame right line,
$till $uppo$ing all external and accidental impediments to be re-
moved?</P>
<P>SIMP. I under$tand that the matter ought to $ucceed exactly
in that manner.</P>
<P>SAGR. But if the piece were placed, not perpendicularly, but
inclining towards $ome place, what would the motion of the ball
be? Would it go haply, as in the other $hot, by the perpendi-
cular line, and return again by the $ame?</P>
<P>SIMP. It would not $o do; but i$$uing out of the piece, it
would pur$ue its motion by a right line which prolongeth the e-
rect perpendicularity of the concave cylinder of the piece, unle$$e
$o far as its own weight would make it decline from that erection
towards the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. So that the mounture of the cylinder is the regulator of
the motion of the ball, nor doth it, or would it move out of that
line, if its own gravity did not make it decline downwards. And
<marg><I>Projects conti-
nue their motion
by the right line
that followeth the
direction of the
motion, made to-
gether with the
projicient, whil'$t
they were conjoin'd
therewith.</I></marg>
therefore placing the cylinder perpendicularly, and $hooting the
ball upwards, it returneth by the $ame right line downwards; be-
cau$e the motion of the ball dependent on its gravity is down-
ward, by the $ame perpendicular. The journey therefore of the
ball out of the piece, continueth or prolongeth the rectitude or
perpendicularity of that $mall part of the $aid journey, which it
made within the $aid piece; is it not $o?</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>155</p>
<P>SIMP. So it is, in my opinion.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now imagine the cylinder to be erected, and that the
Earth doth revolve about with a diurnal motion, carrying the
piece along with it, tell me what $hall be the motion of the ball
within the cylinder, having given fire?</P>
<P>SIMP. It $hall be a $treight and perpendicular motion, the cylin-
der being erected perpendicularly.</P>
<P>SAGR. Con$ider well what you $ay: for I believe that it will
not be perpendicular. It would indeed be perpendicular, if the
Earth $tood $till, for $o the ball would have no other motion but
that proceeding from the fire. But in ca$e the Earth turns round,
<marg><I>The revolution
of the Earth $up-
po$ed, the ball in
the piece erected
perpendicularly,
doth not move by a
perpendicular, but
an inclined line.</I></marg>
the ball that is in the piece, hath likewi$e a diurnal motion, $o
that there being added to the $ame the impul$e of the fire, it mo-
veth from the breech of the piece to the muzzle with two motions,
from the compo$ition whereof it cometh to pa$$e that the motion
made by the centre of the balls gravity is an inclining line. And
for your clearer under$tanding the $ame, let the piece A C [<I>in
Fig.</I> 2.] be erected, and in it the ball B; it is manife$t, that the
piece $tanding immoveable, and fire being given to it, the ball
will make its way out by the mouth A, and with its centre, pa$-
$ing thorow the the piece, $hall have de$cribed the perpendicular
line B A, and it $hall pur$ue that rectitude when it is out of the
piece, moving toward the Zenith. But in ca$e the Earth $hould
move round, and con$equently carry the piece along with it, in
the time that the ball driven out of the piece $hall move along
the cylinder, the piece being carried by the Earth, $hall pa$$e in-
to the $ituation D E, and the ball B, in going off, would be at
the corni$h D, and the motion of the bals centre, would have
been according to the line B D, no longer perpendicular, but in-
clining towards the Ea$t; and the ball (as hath been concluded)
being to continue its motion through the air, according to the
direction of the motion made in the piece, the $aid motion $hall
continue on according to the inclination of the line B D, and $o
$hall no longer be perpendicular, but inclined towards the Ea$t,
to which part the piece doth al$o move; whereupon the ball may
follow the motion of the Eerth, and of the piece. Now <I>Simplicius,</I>
you $ee it demon$trated, that the Range which you took to be
perpendicular, is not $o.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not very well under$tand this bu$ine$s; do you,
<I>Salviatus</I>?</P>
<P>SALV. I apprehend it in part; but I have a certain kind of
$cruple, which I wi$h I knew how to expre$s. It $eems to me, that
according to what hath been $aid, if the Piece be erected perpen-
dicular, and the Earth do move, the ball would not be to fall, as
<I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Tycho</I> will have it, far from the Piece towards the
<foot>V 2 We$t,</foot>
<p n=>156</p>
We$t, nor as you would have it, upon the Piece, but rather far
di$tant towards the Ea$t. For according to yo<*>r explanation, it
would have two motions, the which would with one con$ent carry
it thitherward, to wit, the common motion of the Earth, which
carrieth the Piece and the ball from C A towards E D; and the
fire which carrieth it by the inclined line B D, both motions to-
wards the Ea$t, and therefore they are $uperiour to the motion of
the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. Not $o, Sir. The motion which carrieth the ball to-
wards the Ea$t, cometh all from the Earth, and the fire hath no
part at all therein: the motion which mounteth the ball upwards,
is wholly of fire, wherewith the Earth hath nothing to do. And
that it is $o, if you give not fire, the ball will never go out of the
Piece, nor yet ri$e upwards a hairs breadth; as al$o if you make
the Earth immoveable, and give fire, the ball without any incli-
nation $hall go perpendicularly upwards. The ball therefore ha-
ving two motions, one upwards, and the other in gyration, of both
which the tran$ver$e line B D is compounded, the impul$e upward
is wholly of fire, the circular cometh wholly from the Earth, and
is equal to the Earths motion: and being equal to it, the ball
maintaineth it $elf all the way directly over the mouth of the
Piece, and at la$t falleth back into the $ame: and becau$e it al-
ways ob$erveth the erection of the Piece, it appeareth al$o conti-
nually over the head of him that is near the Piece, and therefore
it appeareth to mount exactly perpendicular towards our Zenith,
or vertical point.</P>
<P>SIMP. I have yet one doubt more remaining, and it is, that in
regard the motion of the ball is very $wift in the Piece, it $eems
not po$$ible, that in that moment of time the tran$po$ition of the
Piece from C A to A D $hould confer $uch an inclination upon
the tran$ver$e line C D, that by means thereof, the ball when it
cometh afterwards into the air $hould be able to follow the cour$e
of the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. You err upon many accounts; and fir$t, the inclination
of the tran$ver$e line C D, I believe it is much greater than you
take it to be, for I verily think that the velocity of the Earths mo-
tion, not onely under the Equinoctial, but in our paralel al$o, is
greater than that of the ball whil$t it moveth in the Piece; $o that
the interval C E would be ab$olutely much bigger than the whole
length of the Piece, and the inclination of the tran$ver$e line con-
$equently bigger than half a right angle: but be the velocity of
the Earth more, or be it le$s, in compari$on of the velocity of the
fire, this imports nothing; for if the velocity of the Earth be $mall,
and con$equently the inclination of the tran$ver$e line be little
al$o; there is then al$o need but of little inclination to make the
<foot>ball</foot>
<p n=>157</p>
ball $u$pend it $elf in its range directly over the Piece. And in a
word, if you do but attentively con$ider, you will comprehend,
that the motion of the Earth in transferring the Piece along with
it from C A to E D, conferreth upon the tran$ver$e line C D, $o
much of little or great inclination, as is required to adju$t the
range to its perpendicularity. But you err, $econdly, in that you
referr the faculty of carrying the ball along with the Earth to the
impul$e of the fire, and you run into the $ame error, into which
<I>Salviatus,</I> but even now $eemed to have fallen; for the faculty
of following the motion of the Earth, is the primary and perpetual
motion, indelibly and in$eparably imparted to the $aid ball, as to a
thing terre$trial, and that of its own nature doth and ever $hall
po$$e$s the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. Let us yield, <I>Simplicius,</I> for the bu$ine$s is ju$t as he
<marg><I>The manner how
Fowlers $hoot birds
flying.</I></marg>
$aith. And now from this di$cour$e let us come to under$tand the
rea$on of a Venatorian Problem, of tho$e Fowlers who with their
guns $hoot a bird flying; and becau$e I did imagine, that in regard
the bird flieth a great pace, therefore they $hould aim their $hot far
from the bird, anticipating its flight for a certain $pace, and more
or le$s according to its velocity and the di$tance of the bird, that
$o the bullet ha$ting directly to the mark aimed at, it might come
to arrive at the $elf $ame time in the $ame point with its motion,
and the bird with its flight, and by that means one to encounter
the other: and asking one of them, if their practi$e was not $o
to do; He told me, no; but that the $light was very ea$ie and
certain, and that they took aim ju$t in the $ame manner as if they
had $hot at a bird that did $it $till; that is, they made the flying
bird their mark, and by moving their fowling-piece they followed
her, keeping their aim $till full upon her, till $uch time as they let
fly, and in this manner $hot her as they did others $itting $till. It is
nece$$ary therefore that that motion, though $low, which the fowl-
ing-piece maketh in turning and following after the flight of the
bird do communicate it $elf to the bullet al$o, and that it be joyned
with that of the fire; $o that the ball hath from the fire the mo-
tion directly upwards, and from the concave Cylinder of the barrel
the declination according to the flight of the Bird, ju$t as was $aid
before of the $hot of a Canon; where the ball receiveth from the
fire a virtue of mounting upwards towards the Zenith, and from
the motion of the Earth its winding towards the Ea$t, and of both
maketh a compound motion that followeth the cour$e of the
Earth, and that to the beholder $eemeth onely to go directly up-
wards, and return again downwards by the $ame line. The hold-
ing therefore of the gun continually directed towards the mark,
maketh the $hoot hit right, and that you may keep your gun di-
rected to the mark, in ca$e the mark $tands $till, you mu$t al$o hold
<foot>your</foot>
<p n=>158</p>
your gun $till; and if the mark $hall move, the gun mu$t be kept upon
the mark by moving. And upon this dependeth the proper an$wer
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the objection tak n
from the $hots of
great Guns made
towards the North
and South.</I></marg>
to the other argument taken from the $hot of a Canon, at the
mark placed towards the South o<*> North: wherein is alledged,
that if the Earth $hould move, the $hots would all range We$t-
ward of the mark, becau$e that in the time whil$t the ball, being
forc'd out of the Piece, goeth through the air to the mark, the $aid
mark being carried toward the Ea$t, would leave the ball to the
We$tward. I an$wer therefore, demanding whether if the Ca-
non be aimed true at the mark, and permitted $o to continue, it
will con$tantly hit the $aid mark, whether the Earth move or $tand
$till? It mu$t be replied, that the aim altereth not at all, for if
the mark doth $tand $till, the Piece al$o doth $tand $till, and if it,
being tran$ported by the Earths motion, doth move, the Piece doth
al$o move at the $ame rate, and, the aim maintained, the $hot
proveth always true, as by what hath been $aid above, is mani-
fe$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. Stay a little, I entreat you, <I>Salviatus,</I> till I have pro-
pounded a certain conceit touching the$e $hooters of birds flying,
who$e proceeding I believe to be the $ame which you relate, and
believe the effect of hitting the bird doth likewi$e follow: but yet
I cannot think that act altogether conformable to this of $hooting
in great Guns, which ought to hit as well when the piece and mark
moveth, as when they both $tand $till; and the$e, in my opinion,
are the particulars in which they di$agree. In $hooting with a
great Gun both it and the mark move with equal velocity, being
both tran$ported by the motion of the Terre$trial Globe: and al-
beit $ometimes the piece being planted more towards the Pole,
than the mark, and con$equently its motion being $omewhat flow-
er than the motion of the mark, as being made in a le$$er circle,
$uch a difference is in$en$ible, at that little di$tance of the piece
from the mark: but in the $hot of the Fowler the motion of the
Fowling-piece wherewith it goeth following the bird, is very $low
in compari$on of the flight of the $aid bird; whence me thinks it
$hould follow, that that $mall motion which the turning of the
Birding-piece conferreth on the bullet that is within it, cannot,
when it is once gone forth of it, multiply it $elf in the air, untill it
come to equal the velocity of the birds flight, $o as that the $aid bullet
$hould always keep direct upon it: nay, me thinketh the bird
would anticipate it and leave it behind. Let me add, that in this
act, the air through which the bullet is to pa$s, partaketh not of the
motion of the bird: whereas in the ca$e of the Canon, both it,
the mark, and the intermediate air, do equally partake of the com-
mon diurnal motion. So that the true cau$e of the Marks-man
his hitting the mark, as it $hould $eem, moreover and be$ides the
<foot>following</foot>
<p n=>159</p>
following the birds flight with the piece, is his $omewhat anticipa-
ting it, taking his aim before it; as al$o his $hooting (as I believe)
not with one bullet, but with many $mall balls (called $hot) the
which $cattering in the air po$$e$s a great $pace; and al$o the ex-
treme velocity wherewith the$e $hot, being di$charged from the
Gun, go towards the bird.</P>
<P>SALV. See how far the winged wit of <I>Sagredus</I> anticipateth,
and out-goeth the dulne$s of mine; which perhaps would have
<marg><I>The an$wer to the
Argument taken
from the $hots at
point blanck to-
wards the Ea$t &amp;
We$t.</I></marg>
light upon the$e di$parities, but not without long $tudie. Now
turning to the matter in hand, there do remain to be con$idered
by us the $hots at point blank, towards the Ea$t and towards the
We$t; the fir$t of which, if the Earth did move, would always
happen to be too high above the mark, and the $econd too low;
fora$much as the parts of the Earth Ea$tward, by rea$on of the di-
urnal motion, do continually de$cend beneath the tangent paralel
to the Horizon, whereupon the Ea$tern $tars to us appear to a$cend;
and on the contrary, the parts We$tward do more and more a$-
cend, whereupon the We$tern $tars do in our $eeming de$cend:
and therefore the ranges which are leveled according to the $aid
tangent at the Oriental mark, (which whil$t the ball pa$$eth
along by the tangent de$cendeth) $hould prove too high, and the
Occidental too low by means of the elevation of the mark, whil$t
the ball pa$$eth along the tangent. The an$wer is like to the re$t:
for as the Ea$tern mark goeth continually de$cending, by rea$on
of the Earths motion, under a tangent that continueth immove-
able; $o likewi$e the piece for the $ame rea$on goeth continually
inclining, and with its mounture pur$uing the $aid mark: by
which means the $hot proveth true.</P>
<P>But here I think it a convenient opportunity to give notice of
<marg><I>The followers of

freely admit cer-

certain conce$$ions, which are granted perhaps over liberally by
the followers of <I>Copernicus</I> unto their Adver$aries: I mean of
yielding to them certain experiments for $ure and certain, which
yet the Adver$aries them$elves had never made tryal of: as for
example, that of things falling from the round-top of a $hip whil$t
it is in motion, and many others; among$t which I verily believe,
that this of experimenting whether the $hot made by a Canon to-
wards the Ea$t proveth too high, and the We$tern $hot too low,
is one: and becau$e I believe that they have never made tryal
thereof, I de$ire that they would tell me what difference they
think ought to happen between the $aid $hots, $uppo$ing the Earth
moveable, or $uppo$ing it moveable; and let <I>Simplieius</I> for this
time an$wer for them.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will not undertake to an$wer $o confidently as another
more intelligent perhaps might do; but $hall $peak what thus upon
the $udden I think they would reply; which is in effect the $ame
<foot>with</foot>
<p n=>160</p>
with that which hath been $aid already, namely, that in ca$e the
Earth $hould move, the $hots made Ea$tward would prove too
high, &amp;c. the ball, as it is probable, being to move along the tan-
gent.</P>
<P>SALV. But if I $hould $ay, that $o it falleth out upon triall,
how would you cen$ure me?</P>
<P>SIMP. It is nece$$ary to proceed to experiments for the pro-

<P>SALV. But do you think, that there is to be found a Gunner $o
skilful, as to hit the mark at every $hoot, in a di$tance of <I>v.g.</I> five
hundred paces?</P>
<P>SIMP. No Sir; nay I believe that there is no one, how good a
marks-man $oever that would promi$e to come within a pace of
the mark,</P>
<P>SALV. How can we then, with $hots $o uncertain, a$$ure our
$elves of that which is in di$pute?</P>
<P>SIMP. We may be a$$ured thereof two wayes; one, by ma-
king many $hots; the other, becau$e in re$pect of the great velo-
city of the Earths motion, the deviation from the mark would in
my opinion be very great.</P>
<P>SALV. Very great, that is more than one pace; in regard that
the varying $o much, yea and more, is granted to happen ordinarily
even in the Earths mobility.</P>
<P>SIMP. I verily believe the variation from the mark would be
more than $o.</P>
<marg><I>A Computation

<P>SALV. Now I de$ire that for our $atisfaction we do make thus
in gro$$e a $light calculation, if you con$ent thereto, which will
$tand us in $tead likewi$e (if the computation $ucceed as I expect)
for a warning how we do in other occurrences $uffer our $elves, as
the $aying is, to be taken with the enemies $houts, and $urrender
up our belief to what ever fir$t pre$ents it $elf to our fancy. And
now to give all advantages to the <I>Peripateticks</I> and <I>Tychonicks,</I>
let us $uppo$e our $elves to be under the Equinoctial, there to $hoot
a piece of Ordinance point blank Ea$twards at a mark five hun-
dred paces off. Fir$t, let us $ee thus (as I $aid) in a level, what
time the $hot after it is gone out of the Piece taketh to arrive at
the mark; which we know to be very little, and is certainly no
more than that wherein a travailer walketh two $teps, which al$o
is le$s than the $econd of a minute of an hour; for $uppo$ing
that the travailer walketh three miles in an hour, which are nine
thou$and paces, being that an hour containes three thou$and, $ix
hundred $econd minutes, the travailer walketh two $teps and an
half in a $econd, a $econd therefore is more than the time of the
balls motion. And for that the diurnal revolution is twenty four
hours, the We$tern horizon ri$eth fifteen degrees in an hour, that
<foot>is,</foot>
<p n=>161</p>
is, fifteen fir$t minutes of a degree, in one fir$t minute of an hour;
that is, fifteen $econds of a degree, in one $econd of an hour; and
becau$e one $econd is the time of the $hot, therefore in this time
the We$tern horizon ri$eth fifteen $econds of a degree, and $o
much likewi$e the mark; and therefore fifteen $econds of that cir-
cle, who$e $emidiameter is five hundred paces (for $o much the di-
$tance of the mark from the Piece was $uppo$ed.) Now let us
look in the table of Arches and Chords ($ee here is <I>Copernicus</I> his
book) what part is the chord of fifteen $econds of the $emidiame-
ter, that is, five hundred paces. Here you $ee the chord (or $ub-
ten$e) of a fir$t minute to be le$s than thirty of tho$e parts, of
which the $emidiameter is an hundred thou$and. Therefore the
chord of a $econd minute $hall be le$s then half of one of tho$e
parts, that is le$s than one of tho$e parts, of whichthe $emidiame-
ter is two hundred thou$and; and therefore the chord of fifteen
conds $hall be le$s than fifteen of tho$e $ame two hundred thou$and
parts; but that which is le$s than <I>(a)</I> fifteen parts of two hun-
<marg><I>(a)</I> That is, in
plainer termes the
fraction 15/200000, is
more than the fra-
ction 4/50000, for di-
viding the denomi-
nators by their no-
minators, and the
fir$t produceth
13333 1/3 the other
but 12500.</marg>
dred thou$and, is al$o more than that which is four cente$mes of
five hundred; therefore the a$cent of the mark in the time of the
balls motion is le$$e than four cente$mes, that is, than one twenty
fifth part of a pace; it $hall be therefore <I>(b)</I> about two inches:
And $o much con$equently $hall be the variation of each We$tern
$hot, the Earth being $uppo$ed to have a diurnal motion. Now if I
$hall tell you, that this variation (I mean of falling two inches $hort
of what they would do in ca$e the Earth did not move) upon tri-
<marg><I>(b)</I> It $hall be
neer 2 2/5 inches, ac-
counting the pace
to be Geometrical,
containing 5 foot.</marg>
all doth happen in all $hots, how will you convince me <I>Simplicius,</I>
$hewing me by an experiment that it is not $o? Do you not $ee
that it is impo$$ible to confute me, unle$s you fir$t find out a way
to $hoot at a mark with $o much exactne$$e, as never to mi$$e an
hairs bredth? For whil$t the ranges of great $hot con$i$t of diffe-
rent numbers of paces, as <I>de facto</I> they do, I will affirm that in
each of tho$e variations there is contained that of two inches cau-
$ed by the motion of the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. Pardon me, <I>Salviatus,</I> you are too liberal. For I would
<marg><I>It is demon$tra-
ted with great $ub-
tilty, that the
Earths motion $up-
po$ed, Canon $hot
ought not to vary
more than in re$t.</I></marg>
tell the <I>Peripateticks,</I> that though every $hot $hould hit the very
centre of the mark, that $hould not in the lea$t di$prove the motion
of the Earth. For the Gunners are $o con$tantly imployed in le-
velling the $ight and gun to the mark, as that they can hit the $ame,
notwith$tanding the motion of the Earth. And I $ay, that if the
Earth $hould $tand $till, the $hots would not prove true; but the
Occidental would be too low, and the Oriental too high: now let
<I>Simplicius</I> di$prove me if he can.</P>
<P>SALV. This is a $ubtilty worthy of <I>Sagredus:</I> But whether
this variation be to be ob$erved in the motion, or in the re$t of the
Earth, it mu$t needs be very $mall, it mu$t needs be $wallowed up
<foot>X in</foot>
<p n=>162</p>
in tho$e very great ones which $undry accidents continually pro-
<marg><I>It is requi$ite to
be very cautious in
admitting experi-
ments for true, to
tho$e who never
tried them.</I></marg>
duce. And all this hath been $poken and granted on good grounds
to <I>Simplicius,</I> and only with an intent to adverti$e him how much
it importeth to be cautious in granting many experiments for true
to tho$e who never had tried them, but only eagerly alledged them
ju$t as they ought to be for the $erving their purpo$e: This is $po-
ken, I $ay, by way of $urplu$$age and Corollary to <I>Simplicius,</I> for
<marg><I>Experiments and
arguments again$t
the Earths motion
$eem $o far con-
cluding, as they lie
hid under equi-
vokes.</I></marg>
the real truth is, that as concerning the$e $hots, the $ame ought ex-
actly to befall a$well in the motion as in the re$t of the Terre$trial
Globe; as likewi$e it will happen in all the other experiments
that either have been or can be produced, which have at fir$t blu$h
$o mnch $emblance of truth, as the antiquated opinion of the
Earths motion hath of equivocation.</P>
<P>SAGR. As for my part I am fully $atisfied, and very well un-
der$tand that who $o $hall imprint in his fancy this general com-
munity of the diurnal conver$ion among$t all things Terre$trial,
to all which it naturally agreeth, a$well as in the old conceit of its
re$t about the centre, $hall doubtle$$e di$cern the fallacy and equi-
voke which made the arguments produced $eem eoncluding.
There yet remains in me $ome h&aelig;$itancy (as I have hinted be-
fore) touching the flight of birds; the which having as it were an
animate faculty of moving at their plea$ure with a thou$and mo-
tions, and to $tay long in the Air $eparated from the Earth, and
therein with mo$t irregular windings to go fluttering to and again,
I cannot conceive how among$t $o great a confu$ion of motions,
they $hould be able to retain the fir$t commune motion; and in
what manner, having once made any $tay behind, they can get
it up again, and overtake the $ame with flying, and kcep pace
with the Towers and trees which hurry with $o precipitant a cour$e
towards the Ea$t; I $ay $o precipitant, for in the great circle of
the Globe it is little le$$e than a thou$and miles an hour, whereof
the flight of the $wallow I believe makes not fifty.</P>
<P>SALV. If the birds were to keep pace with the cour$e of the
trees by help of their wings, they would o$ nece$$ity flie very fa$t;
and if they were deprived of the univer$al conver$ion, they would
lag as far behind; and their flight would $eem as furious towards
the We$t, and to him that could di$cern the $ame, it would
much exceed the flight of an arrow; but I think we could not be
able to perceive it, no more than we $ee a Canon bullet, whil'$t
driven by the fury of the fire, it flieth through the Air: But the
truth is that the proper motion of birds, I mean of their flight,
hath nothing to do with the univer$al motion, to which it is nei-
ther an help, nor an hinderance; and that which maintaineth
the $aid motion unaltered in the birds, is the Air it $elf, thorough
which they flie, which naturally following the <I>Vertigo</I> of the
<foot>Earth</foot>
<p n=>163</p>
Earth, like as it carrieth the clouds along with it, $o it tran$porteth
birds and every thing el$e which is pendent in the $ame; in $o much
that as to the bu$ine$$e of keeping pace with the Earth, the birds
need take no care thereof, but for that work might $leep perpe-
tually.</P>
<P>SAGR. That the Air can carry the clouds along with it, as
being matters ea$ie for their lightne$$e to be moved and deprived
of all other contrary inclination, yea more, as being matters that
partake al$o of the conditions and properties of the Earth; I com-
prehend without any difficulty; but that birds, which as having
life, may move with a motion quite contrary to the diurnal, once
having $urcea$ed the $aid motion, the Air $hould re$tore them to
it, $eems to me a little $trange, and the rather for that they are $olid
and weighty bodies; and withal, we $ee; as hath been $aid, $tones
and other grave bodies to lie unmoved again$t the <I>impetus</I> of the
air; and when they $uffer them$elves to be overcome thereby,
they never acquire $o much velocity as the wind which carrieth
them.</P>
<P>SALV. We a$cribe not $o little force, <I>Sagredus,</I> to the moved
Air, which is able to move and bear before it $hips full fraught,
to tear up trees by the roots, and overthrow Towers when it
moveth $wiftly; and yet we cannot $ay that the motion of the
Air in the$e violent operations is neer $o violent, as that of the
diurnal revolution.</P>
<P>SIMP. You $ee then that the moved Air may al$o cotinue the
motion of projects, according to the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle</I>; and
it $eemed to me very $trange that he $hould have erred in this
particular.</P>
<P>SALV. It may without doubt, in ca$e it could continue it $elf,
but lik as when the wind cea$ing neither $hips go on, nor trees are
blown down, $o the motion in the Air not continuing after the
$tone is gone out of the hand, and the Air cea$ing to move, it
followeth that it mu$t be $omething el$e be$ides the Air that ma-
keth the projects to move.</P>
<P>SIMP. But how upon the winds being laid, doth the $hip cea$e
to move? Nay you may $ee that when the wind is down, and
the $ails furl'd, the ve$$el continueth to run whole miles.</P>
<P>SALV. But this maketh again$t your $elf <I>Simplicius,</I> for that
the wind being laid that filling the $ails drove on the $hip, yet ne-
verthele$$e doth it without help of the <I>medium</I> continue its
cour$e.</P>
<P>SIMP. It might be $aid that the water was the <I>medium</I> which
carried forward the $hip, and maintain'd it in motion.</P>
<P>SALV. It might indeed be $o affirmed, if you would $peak
quite contrary to truth; for the truth is, that the water, by rea-
<foot>X 2 $on</foot>
<p n=>164</p>
$on of its great re$i$tance to the divi$ion made by the hull of the
$hip, doth with great noi$e re$i$t the $ame; nor doth it permit it
of a great while to acquire that velocity which the wind would
confer upon it, were the ob$tacle of the water removed. Per-
haps <I>Simplicius</I> you have never con$idered with what fury the
water be$ets a bark, whil'$t it forceth its way through a $tanding
water by help of Oars or Sails: for if you had ever minded that
effect, you would not now have produced $uch an ab$urdity.
And I am thinking that you have hitherto been one of tho$e who
to find out how $uch things $ucceed, and to come to the know-
ledg of natural effects, do not betake them$elves to a Ship, a
Cro$$e-bow, or a piece of Ordinance, but retire into their $tu-
dies, and turn over Indexes and Tables to $ee whether <I>Aristotle</I>
hath $poken any thing thereof, and being a$$ured of the true
$en$e of the Text, neither de$ire nor care for knowing any
more.</P>
<marg><I>The great feli-
city for which they
are much to be en-
vied who per$wade
them$elves that
they know every
thing.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. This is a great felicity, and they are to be much en-
vied for it. For if knowledg be de$ired by all, and if to be wi$e,
be to think ones $elf $o, they enjoy a very great happine$$e, for
that they may per$wade them$elves that they know and under$tand
all things, in $corn of tho$e who knowing, that they under$tand
not what the$e think they under$tand, and con$equently $eeking
that they know not the very lea$t particle of what is knowable,
kill them$elves with waking and $tudying, and con$ume their days
in experiments and ob$ervations. But pray you let us return to
our birds; touching which you have $aid, that the Air being mo-
ved with great velocity, might re$tore unto them that part of the
diurnal motion which among$t the windings of their flight they
might have lo$t; to which I reply, that the agitated Air $eemeth
unable to confer on a $olid and grave body, $o great a velocity as
its own: And becau$e that of the Air is as great as that of the
Earth, I cannot think that the Air is able to make good the lo$$e
of the birds retardation in flight.</P>
<P>SALV. Your di$cour$e hath in it much of probability, and to
$tick at trivial doubts is not for an acute wit; yet neverthele$$e the
probability being removed, I believed that it hath not a jot more
force than the others already con$idered and re$olved.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is mo$t certain that if it be not nece$$atily conclu-
dent, its efficacy mu$t needs be ju$t nothing at all, for it is
onely when the conclu$ion is nece$$ary that the opponent hath no-
thing to alledg on the contrary.</P>
<P>SALV. Your making a greater $cruple of this than of the other
in$tances dependeth, if I mi$take not, upon the birds being ani-
mated, and thereby enabled to u$e their $trength at plea$ure a-
gain$t the primary motion in-bred in terrene bodies: like as for
<foot>example,</foot>
<p n=>165</p>
example, we $ee them whil'$t they are alive to fly upwards, a thing
altogether impo$$ible for them to do as they are grave bodies;
whereas being dead they can onely fall downwards; and there-
fore you hold that the rea$ons that are of force in all the kinds of
projects above named, cannot take place in birds: Now this is
very true; and becau$e it is $o, <I>Sagredus,</I> that doth not appear
to be done in tho$e projects, which we $ee the birds to do. For if
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the argument ta-
ken from the flight
of birds contrary
to the motion of the
Earth.</I></marg>
from the top of a Tower you let fall a dead bird and a live one,
the dead bird $hall do the $ame that a $tone doth, that is, it $hall
fir$t follow the general motion diurnal, and then the motion of
de$cent, as grave; but if the bird let fall, be a live, what $hall
hinder it, (there ever remaining in it the diurnal motion) from
$oaring by help of its wings to what place of the Horizon it $hall
plea$e? and this new motion, as being peculiar to the bird, and
not participated by us, mu$t of nece$$ity be vi$ible to us; and if
it be moved by help of its wings towards the We$t, what $hall
hinder it from returning with a like help of its wings unto the
Tower. And, becau$e, in the la$t place, the birds wending its
flight towards the We$t was no other than a withdrawing from
the diurnal motion, (which hath, $upppo$e ten degrees of velocity)
one degree onely, there did thereupon remain to the bird whil'$t
it was in its flight nine degrees of velocity, and $o $oon as it did
alight upon the the Earth, the ten common degrees returned to it,
to which, by flying towards the Ea$t it might adde one, and with
tho$e eleven overtake the Tower. And in $hort, if we well con-
$ider, and more narrowly examine the effects of the flight of
birds, they differ from the projects $hot or thrown to any part of
the World in nothing, $ave onely that the projects are moved by an
external projicient, and the birds by an internal principle. And
<marg><I>An experiment
with which alone
is $hewn the nullity
of all the objecti-
ons produced a-
gainst the motion
of the Earth.</I></marg>
here for a final proof of the nullity of all the experiments before
alledged, I conceive it now a time and place convenient to
demon$trate a way how to make an exact trial of them all.
Shut your $elf up with $ome friend in the grand Cabbin between
the decks of $ome large Ship, and there procure gnats, flies, and
$uch other $mall winged creatures: get al$o a great tub (or
other ve$$el) full of water, and within it put certain fi$hes; let
al$o a certain bottle be hung up, which drop by drop letteth forth
its water into another bottle placed underneath, having a narrow
neck: and, the Ship lying $till, ob$erve diligently how tho$e $mall
winged animals fly with like velocity towards all parts of the Ca-
bin; how the fi$hes $wim indifferently towards all $ides; and how
the di$tilling drops all fall into the bottle placed underneath. And
ca$ting any thing towards your friend, you need not throw it with
more force one way then another, provided the di$tances be equal:
and leaping, as the $aying is, with your feet clo$ed, you will reach
<foot>as</foot>
<p n=>166</p>
as far one way as another. Having ob$erved all the$e particulars,
though no man doubteth that $o long as the ve$$el $tands $till, they
ought to $ucceed in this manner; make the Ship to move with
what velocity you plea$e; for ($o long as the motion is uniforme,
and not fluctuating this way and that way) you $hall not di$cern
any the lea$t alteration in all the forenamed effects; nor can you
gather by any of them whether the Ship doth move or $tand $till.
In leaping you $hall reach as far upon the floor, as before; nor for
that the Ship moveth $hall you make a greater leap towards the
poop than towards the prow; howbeit in the time that you $taid
in the Air, the floor under your feet $hall have run the contrary way
to that of your jump; and throwing any thing to your companion
you $hall not need to ca$t it with more $trength that it may reach
him, if he $hall be towards the prow, and you towards the poop,
then if you $tood in a contrary $ituation; the drops $hall all di$till
as before into the inferiour bottle and not $o much as one $hall
fall towards the poop, albeit whil'$t the drop is in the Air, the Ship
$hall have run many feet; the Fi$hes in their water $hall not $wim
with more trouble towards the fore-part, than towards the hinder
part of the tub; but $hall with equal velocity make to the bait
placed on any $ide of the tub; and la$tly, the flies and gnats
$hall continue their flight indifferently towards all parts; nor
$hall they ever happen to be driven together towards the $ide of
the Cabbin next the prow, as if they were wearied with fol-
lowing the $wift cour$e of the Ship, from which through their
$u$pen$ion in the Air, they had been long $eparated; and if
burning a few graines of incen$e you make a little $moke,
you $hall $ee it a$cend on high, and there in manner of a cloud
$u$pend it $elf, and move indifferently, not inclining more to one
$ide than another: and of this corre$pondence of effects the cau$e
is for that the Ships motion is common to all the things contained
in it, and to the Air al$o; I mean if tho$e things be $hut up in the
Cabbin: but in ca$e tho$e things were above deck in the open Air,
and not obliged to follow the cour$e of the Ship, differences more
or le$$e notable would be ob$erved in $ome of the fore-named ef-
fects, and there is no doubt but that the $moke would $tay behind
as much as the Air it $elf; the flies al$o, and the gnats being hin-
dered by the Air would not be able to follow the motion of the
Ship, if they were $eparated at any di$tance from it. But keeping
neer thereto, becau$e the Ship it $elf as being an unfractuous Fa-
brick, carrieth along with it part of its neere$t Air, they would
follow the $aid Ship without any pains or difficulty. And for the
like rea$on we $ee $ometimes in riding po$t, that the trouble$ome
flies and ^{*} hornets do follow the hor$es flying $ometimes to one,
<marg>* Tafaris, <I>bor$e-
flyes.</I></marg>
$ometimes to another part of the body, but in the falling drops
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>167</p>
the difference would be very $mall; and in the $alts, and projecti-
ons of grave bodies altogether imperceptible.</P>
<P>SAGR. Though it came not into my thoughts to make triall of
the$e ob$ervations, when I was at Sea, yet am I confident that they
will $ucceed in the $ame manner, as you have related; in confirma-
tion of which I remember that being in my Cabbin I have asked
an hundred times whether the Ship moved or $tood $till; and
$ometimes I have imagined that it moved one way, when it $teered
quite another way. I am therefore as hitherto $atisfied and con-
vinced of the nullity of all tho$e experiments that have been pro-
duced in proof of the negative part. There now remains the ob-
jection founded upon that which experience $hews us, namely, that
a $wift <I>Vertigo</I> or whirling about hath a faculty to extrude and
di$per$e the matters adherent to the machine that turns round;
whereupon many were of opinion, and <I>Ptolomy</I> among$t the re$t,
that if the Earth $hould turn round with $o great velocity, the
$tones and creatures upon it $hould be to$t into the Skie, and
that there could not be a morter $trong enough to fa$ten buildings
$o to their foundations, but that they would likewi$e $uffer a like
extru$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. Before I come to an$wer this objection, I cannot but
take notice of that which I have an hundred times ob$erved, and
not without laughter, to come into the minds of mo$t men $o $oon
as ever they hear mention made of this motion of the Earth, which
is believed by them $o fixt and immoveable, that they not only ne-
ver doubted of that re$t, but have ever $trongly believed that all
other men a$well as they, have held it to be created immoveable,
and $o to have continued through all $ucceeding ages: and being
<marg><I>The $tupidity of
$ome that think the
Earth to have be-
gun to move, when</I>
Pythagoras <I>began
to affirme that it
did $o.</I></marg>
$etled in this per$wa$ion, they $tand amazed to hear that any one
$hould grant it motion, as if, after that he had held it to be immo-
veable, he had fondly thought it to commence its motion then
(and not till then) when <I>Pythagoras</I> (or whoever el$e was the fir$t
hinter of its mobility) $aid that it did move. Now that $uch a foo-
li$h conceit (I mean of thinking that tho$e who admit the motion
of the Earth, have fir$t thought it to $tand $till from its creation,
untill the time of <I>Pythagoras,</I> and have onely made it moveable
after that <I>Pythagor as</I> e$teemed it $o) findeth a place in the mindes
of the vulgar, and men of $hallow capacities, I do not much won-
der; but that $uch per$ons as <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy</I> $hould al$o
run into this childi$h mi$take, is to my thinking a more admirable
and unpardonable folly.</P>
<P>SAGR. You believe then, <I>Salviatus,</I> that <I>Ptolomy</I> thought, that
in his Di$putation he was to maintain the $tability of the Earth
again$t $uch per$ons, as granting it to have been immoveable, un-
till the time of <I>Pythagoras,</I> did affirm it to have been but then
<foot>made</foot>
<p n=>168</p>
made moveable, when the $aid <I>Pythagoras</I> a$cribed unto it mo-
tion.</P>
<P>SALV. We can think no other, if we do but con$ider the way
<marg>Ari$totle <I>and</I>
Ptolomy <I>$eem to
confute the mobili-
ty of the Earth a-
gain$t tho$e who
thought that it ha-
ving a long time
$tood still, did be-
gin to move in the
time of</I> Pythagoras</marg>
he taketh to confute their a$$ertion; the confutation of which
con$i$ts in the demolition of buildings, and the to$$ing of $tones,
living creatures and men them$elves up into the Air. And be-
cau$e $uch overthrows and extru$ions cannot be made upon buil-
dings and men, which were not before on the Earth, nor can men
be placed, nor buildings erected upon the Earth, unle$$e when it
$tandeth $till; hence therefore it is cleer, that <I>Ptolomy</I> argueth a-
gain$t tho$e, who having granted the $tability of the Earth for
$ome time, that is, $o long as living creatures, $tones, and Ma$ons
were able to abide there, and to build Palaces and Cities, make it
afterwards precipitately moveable to the overthrow and de$tructi-
of Edifices, and living creatures, &amp;c. For if he had undertook to
di$pute again$t $uch as had a$cribed that revolution to the Earth
from its fir$t creation, he would have confuted them by $aying,
that if the Earth had alwayes moved, there could never have been
placed upon it either men or $tones; much le$s could buildings
have been erected, or Cities founded, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not well conceive the$e <I>Ari$totelick</I> and <I>Ptolo-
maick</I> inconveniences.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Ptolomey</I> either argueth again$t tho$e who have e$teem-
ed the Earth always moveable; or again$t $uch as have held that
it $tood for $ome time $till, and hath $ince been $et on moving.
If again$t the fir$t, he ought to $ay, that the Earth did not always
move, for that then there would never have been men, animals, or
edifices on the Earth, its <I>vertigo</I> not permitting them to $tay
thereon. But in that he arguing, $aith that the Earth doth not
move, becau$e that bea$ts, men, and hou$es before plac'd on the
Earth would precipitate, he $uppo$eth the Earth to have been once
in $uch a $tate, as that it did admit men and bea$ts to $tay, and
build thereon; the which draweth on the con$equence, that it
did for $ome time $tand $till, to wit, was apt for the abode of a-
nimals and erection of buildings. Do you now conceive what I
would $ay?</P>
<P>SIMP. I do, and I do not: but this little importeth to the
merit of the cau$e; nor can a $mall mi$take of <I>Ptolomey,</I> com-
mitted through inadvertencie be $ufficient to move the Earth,
when it is immoveable. But omitting cavils, let us come to the
$ub$tance of the argument, which to me $eems unan$werable.</P>
<P>SALV. And I, <I>Simplicius,</I> will drive it home, and re-inforce it,
by $hewing yet more $en$ibly, that it is true that grave bodies
turn'd with velocity about a $ettled centre, do acquire an <I>impetus</I>
of moving, and receding to a di$tance from that centre, even
<foot>then</foot>
<p n=>169</p>
then when they are in a $tate of having a propen$ion of moving
naturally to the $ame. Tie a bottle that hath water in it, to
the end of a cord, and holding the other end fa$t in your hand,
and making the cord and your arm the $emi-diameter, and the
knitting of the $houlder the centre, $wing the bottle very fa$t a-
bout, $o as that it may de$cribe the circumference of a circle,
which, whether it be parallel to the Horizon, or perpendicular to
it, or any way inclined, it $hall in all ca$es follow, that the wa-
ter will not fall out of the bottle: nay, he that $hall $wing it,
$hall find the cord always draw, and $trive to go farther from the
$houlder. And if you bore a hole in the bottom of the bottle,
you $hall $ee the water $pout forth no le$s upwards into the skie,
than laterally, and downwards to the Earth; and if in$tead of wa-
ter, you $hall put little pebble $tones into the bottle, and $wing it
in the $ame manner, you $hall find that they will $trive in the like
manner again$t the cord. And la$tly, we $ee boys throw $tones
a great way, by $winging round a piece of a $tick, at the end of
which the $tone is let into a $lit <I>(which $tick is called by them a
$ling;)</I> all which are arguments of the truth of the conclu$ion,
to wit, that the <I>vertigo</I> or $wing conferreth upon the moveable,
a motion towards the circumference, in ca$e the motion be $wift:
and therefore if the Earth revolve about its own centre, the mo-
tion of the $uperficies, and e$pecially towards the great circle,
as being incomparably more $wift than tho$e before named, ought
to extrude all things up into the air.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Argument $eemeth to me very well proved and
inforced; and I believe it would be an hard matter to an$wer and
overthrow it.</P>
<P>SALV. Its $olution dependeth upon certain notions no le$s
known and believed by you, than by my $elf: but becau$e they
come not into your mind, therefore it is that you perceive not the
an$wer; wherefore, without telling you it (for that you know the
$ame already) I $hall with onely a$$i$ting your memory, make you
to refute this argument.</P>
<P>SIMP. I have often thought of your way of arguing, which
hath made me almo$t think that you lean to that opinion of <I>Pla-</I>
<marg><I>Our krowledg is
a kind of remini$-
cence according to</I>
Plato.</marg>
<I>to, Qu&ograve;d no$trum $cire $it quoddam remini$ci</I>; therefore I intreat
you to free me from this doubt, by letting me know your judg-
ment.</P>
<P>SALV. What I think of the opinion of <I>Plato,</I> you may gather
from my words and actions. I have already in the precedent con-
ferences expre$ly declared my $elf more than once; I will pur$ue
the $ame $tyle in the pre$ent ca$e, which may hereafter $erve you
for an example, thereby the more ea$ily to gather what my opi-
nion is touching the attainment of knowledg, when a time $hall
<foot>Y offer</foot>
<p n=>170</p>
offer upon $ome other day: but I would not have <I>Sagredus</I> of-
fended at this digre$$ion.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am rather very much plea$ed with it, for that I re-
member that when I $tudied Logick, I could never comprehend that
$o much cry'd up and mo$t potent demon$tration of <I>Ari$totle.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Let us go on therefore; and let <I>Simplicius,</I> tell me
what that motion is which the $tone maketh that is held fa$t in the
$lit of the $ling, when the boy $wings it about to throw it a great
way?</P>
<P>SIMP. The motion of the $tone, $o long as it is in the $lit, is
circular, that is, moveth by the arch of a circle, who$e $tedfa$t
centre is the knitting of the $houlder, and its $emi-diameter the arm
and $tick.</P>
<P>SALV. And when the $tone leaveth the $ling, what is its mo-
tion? Doth it continue to follow its former circle, or doth it go
by another line?</P>
<P>SIMP. It will continue no longer to $wing round, for then it
would not go farther from the arm of the projicient, whereas
we $ee it go a great way off.</P>
<P>SALV. With what motion doth it move then?</P>
<P>SIMP. Give me a little time to think thereof; For I have ne-
ver con$idered it before.</P>
<P>SALV. Hark hither, <I>Sagredus</I>; this is the <I>Quoddam remini$ci</I>
in a $ubject well under$tood. You have pau$ed a great while,
<I>Simplicius.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. As far as I can $ee, the motion received in going out of
the $ling, can be no other than by a right line; nay, it mu$t ne-
ce$$arily be $o, if we $peak of the pure adventitious <I>impetus.</I> I
was a little puzled to $ee it make an arch, but becau$e that arch
bended all the way upwards, and no other way, I conceive that
<marg><I>The motion im-
pre$$ed by the pro-
jicient is onely by a
right line.</I></marg>
that incurvation cometh from the gravity of the $tone, which na-
turally draweth it downwards. The impre$$ed <I>impetus,</I> I $ay,
without re$pecting the natural, is by a right line.</P>
<P>SALV. But by what right line? Becau$e infinite, and towards
every $ide may be produced from the $lit of the $ling, and from the
point of the $tones $eparation from the $ling.</P>
<P>SIMP. It moveth by that line which goeth directly from the
motion which the $tone made in the $ling.</P>
<P>SALV. The motion of the $tone whil$t it was in the $lit, you
have affirmed already to be circular; now circularity oppo$eth
directne$s, there not being in the circular line any part that is di-
rect or $treight.</P>
<P>SIMP I mean not that the projected motion is direct in re-
$pect of the whole circle, but in reference to that ultimate point,
where the circular motion determineth. I know what I would
<foot>$ay,</foot>
<p n=>171</p>
$ay, but do not well know how to expre$s my $elf.</P>
<P>SALV. And I al$o perceive that you under$tand the bu$ine$s,
but that you have not the proper terms, wherewith to expre$s the
$ame. Now the$e I can ea$ily teach you; teach you, that is, as
to the words, but not as to the truths, which are things. And that
you may plainly $ee that you know the thing I ask you, and onely
want language to expre$s it, tell me, when you $hoot a bullet out
of a gun, towards what part is it, that its acquired <I>impetus</I> carri-
eth it?</P>
<P>SIMP. Its acquired <I>impetus</I> carrieth it in a right line, which
continueth the rectitude of the barrel, that is, which inclineth nei-
ther to the right hand nor to the left, nor upwards not down-
wards.</P>
<P>SALV. Which in $hort is a$much as to $ay, it maketh no angle
with the line of $treight motion made by the $ling.</P>
<P>SIMP. So I would have $aid.</P>
<P>SALV. If then the line of the projects motion be to continue
without making an angle upon the circular line de$cribed by it,
whil$t it was with the projicient; and if from this circular motion it
ought to pa$s to the right motion, what ought this right line to be?</P>
<P>SIMP. It mu$t needs be that which toucheth the circle in the
point of $eparation, for that all others, in my opinion, being pro-
longed would inter$ect the circumference, and by that means make
$ome angle therewith.</P>
<P>SALV. You have argued very well, and $hewn your $elf half a
Geometrician. Keep in mind therefore, that your true opinion
is expre$t in the$e words, namely, That the project acquireth an
<I>impetus</I> of moving by the Tangent, the arch de$cribed by the
motion of the projicient, in the point of the $aid projects $epara-
tion from the projicient.</P>
<P>SIMP. I under$tand you very well, and this is that which I
would $ay.</P>
<P>SALV. Of a right line which toucheth a circle, which of its
points is the neare$t to the centre of that circle?</P>
<P>SIMP. That of the contact without doubt: for that is in the
circumference of a circle, and the re$t without: and the points of
the circumference are all equidi$tant from the centre.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore a moveable departing from the contact, and
moving by the $treight Tangent, goeth continually farther and
farther from the contact, and al$o from the centre of the circle.</P>
<P>SIMP. It doth $o doubtle$s.</P>
<P>SALV. Now if you have kept in mind the propo$itions, which
you have told me, lay them together, and tell me what you gather
from them.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think I am not $o forgetful, but that I do remember
<foot>Y 2 them.</foot>
<p n=>172</p>
<marg><I>The project mo-
veth by the Tan-
gent of the circle of
the motion prece-
dent in the point of

them. From the things premi$ed I gather that the project $wiftly
$winged round by the projicient, in its $eparating from it, doth re-
tain an <I>impetus</I> of continuing its motion by the right line, which
toucheth the circle de$cribed by the motion of the projicient in
the point of $eparation, by which motion the project goeth con-
tinually receding from the centre of the circle de$cribed by the
motion of the projicient.</P>
<P>SALV. You know then by this time the rea$on why grave bo-
dies $ticking to the rim of a wheele, $wiftly moved, are extruded
and thrown beyond the circumference to yet a farther di$tance
from the centre.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think I under$tand this very well; but this new know-
ledg rather increa$eth than le$$eneth my incredulity that the Earth
can turn round with $o great velocity, without extruding up into
the sky, $tones, animals, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SALV. In the $ame manner that you have under$tood all this,
you $hall, nay you do under$tand the re$t: and with recollecting
your $elf, you may remember the $ame without the help of o-
thers: but that we may lo$e no time, I will help your memory
therein. You do already know of your $elf, that the circular mo-
tion of the projicient impre$$eth on the project an <I>impetus</I> of mo-
ving (when they come to $eparate) by the right Tangent, the
circle of the motion in the point of $eparation, and continuing a-
long by the $ame the motion ever goeth receding farther and far-
ther from the projicient: and you have $aid, that the project
would continue to move along by that right line, if there were not
by its proper weight an inclination of de$cent added unto it; from
which the incurvation of the line of motion is derived. It $eems
moreover that you knew of your $elf, that this incurvation al-
ways bended towards the centre of the Earth, for thither do all
grave bodies tend. Now I proceed a little farther, and ask you, whe-
ther the moveable after its $eparation, in continuing the right mo-
tion goeth always equally receding from the centre, or if you will,
from the circumference of that circle, of which the precedent mo-
tion was a part; which is as much as to $ay, Whether a moveable,
that for$aking the point of a Tangent, and moving along by the
$aid Tangent, doth equally recede from the point of contact, and
from the circumference of the circle?</P>
<P>SIMP. No, Sir: for the Tangent near to the point of contact,
recedeth very little from the circumference, wherewith it keepeth
a very narrow angle, but in its going farther and farther
off, the di$tance always encrea$eth with a greater proportion; $o
that in a circle that $hould have <I>v. g.</I> ten yards of diameter, a point
of the Tangent that was di$tant from the contact but two palms,
would be three or four times as far di$tant from the circumference
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>173</p>
of the circle, as a point that was di$tant from the contaction one
palm, and the point that was di$tant half a palm, I likewi$e believe
would $car$e recede the fourth part of the di$tance of the $econd:
fo that within an inch or two of the contact, the $eparation of the
Tangent from the circumference is $car$e di$cernable.</P>
<P>SALV. So that the rece$$ion of the project from the circumfe-
rence of the precedent circular motion is very $mall in the begin-
ing?</P>
<P>SIMP. Almo$t in$en$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. Now tell me a little; the project, which from the mo-
tion of the projicient receiveth an <I>impetus</I> of moving along the
Tangent in a right line, and that would keep unto the $ame, did
not its own weight depre$s it downwards, how long is it after the
$eparation, ere it begin to decline downwards.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that it beginneth pre$ently; for it not ha-
ving any thing to uphold it, its proper gravity cannot but ope-
rate.</P>
<marg><I>A grave project,
as $oon as it is $e-
parated from the
projicient begineth
to decline.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. So that, if that $ame $tone, which being extruded from
that wheel turn'd about very fa$t, had as great a natural propen-
$ion of moving towards the centre of the $aid wheel, as it hath to
move towards the centre of the Earth, it would be an ea$ie mat-
ter for it to return unto the wheel, or rather not to depart from it;
in regard that upon the begining of the $eparation, the rece$$ion be-
ing $o $inall, by rea$on of the infinite acutene$s of the angle of
contact, every very little of inclination that draweth it back to-
wards the centie of the wheel, would be $ufficient to retain it up-
on the rim or circumference.</P>
<P>SIMP. I que$tion not, but that if one $uppo$e that which nei-
ther is, nor can be, to wit, that the inclination of tho$e grave bo-
dies was to go towards the centre of the wheel, they would never
come to be extruded or $haken off.</P>
<P>SALV. But I neither do, nor need to $uppo$e that which is not;
for I will not deny but that the $tones are extruded. Yet I $peak
this by way of $uppo$ition, to the end that you might grant me
the re$t. Now fancy to your $elf, that the Earth is that great
wheel, which moved with $o great velocity is to extrude the $tones.
You could tell me very well even now, that the motion of proje-
ction ought to be by that right line which toucheth the Earth in
the point of $eparation: and this Tangent, how doth it notably
recede from the $uperficies of the Terre$trial Globe?</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe, that in a thou$and yards, it will not recede
from the Earth an inch.</P>
<P>SALV. And did you not $ay, that the project being drawn by
its own weight, declineth from the Tangent towards the centre of
the Earth?</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>174</p>
<P>SIMP. I $aid $o, and al$o confe$$e the re$t: and do now plainly
under$tand that the $tone will not $eparate from the Earth, for
that its rece$$ion in the beginning would be $uch, and $o $mall,
that it is a thou$and times exceeded by the inclination which the
$tone hath to move towards the centre of the Earth, which cen-
tre in this ca$e is al$o the centre of the wheel. And indeed it mu$t
be confe$$ed that the $tones, the living creatures, and the other
grave bodies cannot be extruded; but here again the lighter things
beget in me a new doubt, they having but a very weak propen$ion
of de$cent towards the centre; $o that there being wanting in
them that faculty of withdrawing from the $uperficies, I $ee not,
but that they may be extruded; and you know the rule, that <I>ad
de$truendum $ufficit unum.</I></P>
<P>SAVL. We will al$o give you $atisfaction in this. Tell me
therefore in the fir$t place, what you under$tand by light matters,
that is, whether you thereby mean things really $o light, as that
they go upwards, or el$e not ab$olutely light, but of $o $mall gra-
vity, that though they de$cend downwards, it is but very $lowly;
for if you mean the ab$olutely light, I will be readier than your
$elf to admit their extru$ion.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $peak of the other $ort, $uch as are feathers, wool, cot-
ton, and the like; to lift up which every $mall force $ufficeth:
yet neverthele$$e we $ee they re$t on the Earth very quietly.</P>
<P>SALV. This pen, as it hath a natural propen$ion to de$cend to-
wards the $uperficies of the Earth, though it be very $mall, yet I
mu$t tell you that it $ufficeth to keep it from mounting upwards:
and this again is not unknown to you your $elf; therefore tell me
if the pen were extruded by the <I>Vertigo</I> of the Earth, by what
line would it move?</P>
<P>SIMP. By the tangent in the point of $eparation.</P>
<P>SALV. And when it $hould be to return, and re-unite it $elf to
the Earth, by what line would it then move?</P>
<P>SIMP. By that which goeth from it to the centre of the
Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. So then here falls under our con$ideration two moti-
ons; one the motion of projection, which beginneth from the
point of contact, and proceedeth along the tangent; and the o-
ther the motion of inclination downwards, which beginneth from
the project it $elf, and goeth by the $ecant towards the centre; and
if you de$ire that the projection follow, it is nece$$ary that the <I>im-
petus</I> by the tangent overcome the inclination by the $ecant: is it
not $o?</P>
<P>SIMP. So it $eemeth to me.</P>
<P>SALV. But what is it that you think nece$$ary in the motion
of the projicient, to make that it may prevail over that inclina-
<foot>tion,</foot>
<p n=>175</p>
tion, from which en$ueth the $eparation and elongation of the
pen from the Earth?</P>
<P>SIMP. I cannot tell.</P>
<P>SALV. How, do you not know that? The moveable is here
the $ame, that is, the $ame pen; now how can the $ame moveable
$uperate and exceed it $elf in motion?</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not $ee how it can overcome or yield to it $elf in
motion, unle$$e by moving one while fa$ter, and another while
$lower.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ee then, that you do know it. If therefore the
projection of the pen ought to follow, and its motion by the tan-
gent be to overcome its motion by the $ecant, what is it requi$ite
that their velocities $hould be?</P>
<P>SIMP. It is requi$ite that the motion by the tangent be greater
than that other by the $ecant. But wretch that I am! Is it not
only many thou$and times greater than the de$cending motion of
the pen, but than that of the $tone? And yet like a $imple fellow
I had $uffered my $elf to be per$waded, that $tones could not be
extruded by the revolution of the Earth. I do therefore revoke
my former $entence, and $ay, that if the Earth $hould move,
$tones, Elephants, Towers, and whole Cities would of nece$$ity be
to$t up into the Air; and becau$e that that doth not evene, I con-
clude that the Earth doth not move.</P>
<P>SALV. Softly <I>Simplicius,</I> you go on $o fa$t, that I begin to be
more afraid for you, than for the pen. Re$t a little, and ob$erve what
I am going to $peap. If for the reteining of the $tone or pen an-
nexed to the Earths $urface it were nece$$ary that its motion of
de$cent were greater, or as much as the motion made by the tan-
gent; you would have had rea$on to $ay, that it ought of nece$$ity
to move as fa$t, or fa$ter by the $ecant downwards, than by the
tangent Ea$twards: But did not you tell me even now, that a
thou$and yards of di$tance by the tangent from the contact, do
remove hardly an inch from the circumference? It is not $uffici-
ent therefore that the motion by the tangent, which is the $ame
with that of the diurnall <I>Vertigo,</I> (or ha$ty revolution) be fimply
more $wift than the motion by the $ecant, which is the $ame with
that of the pen in de$cending; but it is requi$ite that the $ame be
$o much more $wift as that the time which $ufficeth for the pen
to move <I>v.g.</I> a thou$and yards by the tangent, be in$ufficient for
it to move one $ole inch by the $ecant. The which I tell you $hall
never be, though you $hould make that motion never $o $wift,
and this never $o $low.</P>
<P>SIMP. And why might not that by the tangent be $o $wift, as
not to give the pen time to return to the $urface of the Earth?</P>
<P>SALV. Try whether you can $tate the ca$e in proper termes,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>176</p>
and I will give you an an$wer. Tell me therefore, how much do
you think $ufficeth to make that motion $wifter than this?</P>
<P>SIMP. I will $ay for example, that if that motion by the tan-
gent were a million of times $wifter than this by the $ecant, the
pen, yea, and the $tone al$o would come to be extruded.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ay $o, and $ay that which is fal$e, onely for
want, not of Logick, Phy$icks, or Metaphy$icks, but of Geome-
try; for if you did but under$tand its fir$t elements, you would
know, that from the centre of a circle a right line may be drawn
to meet the tangent, which inter$ecteth it in $uch a manner, that
the part of the tangent between the contact and the $ecant, may
be one, two, or three millions of times greater than that part of
the $ecant which lieth between the tangent and the circumference,
and that the neerer and neerer the $ecant $hall be to the contact,
this proportion $hall grow greater and greater <I>in infinitum</I>; $o
that it need not be feared, though the <I>vertigo</I> be $wift, and the
motion downwards $low, that the pen or other lighter matter can
begin to ri$e upwards, for that the inclination downwards always
exceedeth the velocity of the projection.</P>
<P>SAGR. I do not perfectly apprehend this bu$ine$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. I will give you a mo$t univer$al yet very ea$ie demon-
<marg><I>A geometrical
demon$tration to
prove the impo$$i-
bility of <*>tru$ion
by means of the
terre$trial</I> vertigo.</marg>
$tration thereof. Let a proportion be given between B A [<I>in Fig.</I>
3.] and C: And let B A be greater than C at plea$ure. And let
there be de$cribed a circle, who$e centre is D. From which it is
required to draw a $ecant, in $uch manner, that the tangent may
be in proportion to the $aid $ecant, as B A to C. Let A I be
$uppo$ed a third proportional to B A and C. And as B I is to
I A, $o let the diameter F E be to E G; and from the point G,
let there be drawn the tangent G H. I $ay that all this is done as
was required; and as B A is to C, $o is H G to G E. And in re-
gard that as B I is to I A, $o is F E to E G; therefore by compo-
$ition, as B A is to A I; $o $hall F G be to G E. And becau$e C
is the middle proportion between <I>B</I> A and A I; and G H is a
middle term between F G and G E; therefore, as B A is to C,
$o $hall F G be to G H; that is H G to G E, which was to be
demon$trated.</P>
<P>SAGR. I apprehend this demon$tration; yet neverthele$$e, I
am not left wholly without h&aelig;$itation; for I find certain confu-
$ed $cruples role to and again in my mind, which like thick and
dark clouds, permit me not to di$cern the cleerne$$e and nece$$ity
of the conclu$ion with that per$picuity, which is u$ual in Mathe-
matical Demon$trations. And that which I $tick at is this. It is
true that the $paces between the tangent and the circumference do
gradually dimini$h <I>in infinitum</I> towards the contact; but it is al$o
true on the contrary, that the propen$ion of the moveable to
<foot>de-</foot>
<p n=>177</p>
de$cending groweth le$s &amp; le$s in it, the nearer it is to the fir$t term
of its de$cent; that is, to the $tate of re$t; as is manife$t from that
which you declare unto us, demon$trating that the de$cending grave
body departing from re$t, ought to pa$$e thorow all the degrees of
tardity comprehended between the $aid re$t, &amp; any a$$igned degree
of velocity, the which grow le$s and le$s <I>in infinitum.</I> To which may
be added, that the $aid velocity and propen$ion to motion, doth for
another rea$on dimini$h to infinity; and it is becau$e the gravity of
the $aid moveable may infinitely dimini$h. So that the cau$es which
dimini$h the propen$ion of a$cending, and con$equently favour
the projection, are two; that is, the levity of the moveable, and its
vicinity to the $tate of re$t; both which are augmentable <I>in infinit.</I>
and the$e two on the contrary being to contract but with one $ole
cau$e of making the projection, I cannot conceive how it alone, al-
though it al$o do admit of infinite augmentation, $hould be able to
remain invincible again$t the union &amp; confederacy of the others, w^{ch}
are two, and are in like manner capable of infinite augmentation.</P>
<P>SALV. This is a doubt worthy of <I>Sagredus</I>; and to explain it $o as
that we may more cleerly apprehend it, for that you $ay that you
your $elf have but a confu$ed <I>Idea</I> of it, we will di$tingui$h of the
$ame by reducing it into figure; which may al$o perhaps afford us
$ome ca$e in re$olving the $ame. Let us therefore [<I>in Fig.</I> 4.] draw
a perpendicular line towards the centre, and let it be AC, and to it
at right angles let there be drawn the Horizontal line A <I>B,</I> upon
which the motion of the projection ought to be made; now the pro-
ject would continue to move along the $ame with an even motion, if
$o be its gravity did not incline it downwards. Let us $uppo$e from
the point A a right line to be drawn, that may make any angle at
plea$ure with the line A B; which let be A E, and upon A<I>B</I> let us
mark $ome equal $paces AF, FH, HK, and from them let us let fall
the perpendiculars FG, HI, K L, as far as AE. And becau$e, as al
ready hath been $aid, the de$cending grave body departing from re$t,
goeth from time to time acquiring a greater degree of velocity,
according as the $aid time doth $ucce$$ively encrea$e; we may con-
ceive the $paces AF, FH, HK, to repre$ent unto us equal times; and
the perpendiculars FG, HI, KL, degrees of velocity acquired in the
$aid times; $o that the degree of velocity acquired in the whole time
A K, is as the line K L, in re$pect to the degree H I, acquired in the
time AH, and the degree FG in the time AF; the which degrees KL,
HI, FG, are (as is manife$t) the $ame in proportion, as the times K A,
HA, F A, and if other perpendiculars were drawn from the points
marked at plea$ure in the line F A, one might $ucce$$ively find de-
grees le$$e and le$$e <I>in infinitum,</I> proceeding towards the point A,
repre$enting the fir$t in$tant of time, and the fir$t $tate of re$t. And
this retreat towards A, repre$enteth the fir$t propen$ion to the
<foot>Z mo-</foot>
<p n=>178</p>
motion of de$cent, dimini$hed <I>in infinitum</I> by the approach of
the moveable to the fir$t $tate of re$t, which approximation is
augmentable <I>in infinitum.</I> Now let us find the other diminution
of velocity, which likewi$e may proceed to infinity, by the di-
minution of the gravity of the moveable, and this $hall be repre-
$ented by drawing other lines from the point A, which contein
angles le$$e than the angle B A E, which would be this line A D,
the which inter$ecting the parallels K L, H I, F G, in the points
M, N, and O, repre$ent unto us the degrees F O, H N, K M,
acquired in the times A F, A H, A K, le$$e than the other de-
grees F G, H I, K L, acquired in the $ame times; but the$e
latter by a moveable more ponderous, and tho$e other by a
moveable more <I>light.</I> And it is manife$t, that by the retreat of
the line E A towards A B, contracting the angle E A B (the
which may be done <I>in infinitum,</I> like as the gravity may <I>in infi-
nitum</I> be dimini$hed) the velocity of the cadent moveable may
in like manner be dimini$hed <I>in infinitum,</I> and $o con$equently
the cau$e that impeded the projection; and therefore my thinks
that the union of the$e two rea$ons again$t the projection, dimi-
ni$hed to infinity, cannot be any impediment to the $aid proje-
ction. And couching the whole argument in its $horte$t terms, we
will $ay, that by contracting the angle E A B, the degrees of ve-
locity L K, I H, G F, are dimini$hed; and moreover by the re-
treat of the parallels K L, H I, F G, towards the angle A, the
fame degrees are again dimini$hed; and both the$e diminutions
extend to infinity: Therefore the velocity of the motion of de-
$cent may very well dimini$h $o much, (it admitting of a two$old
diminution <I>in infinitum</I>) as that it may not $uffice to re$tore the
moveable to the circumference of the wheel, and thereupon may
occa$ion the projection to be hindered and wholly obviated.</P>
<P>Again on the contrary, to impede the projection, it is nece$-
$ary that the $paces by which the project is to de$cend for the
reuniting it $elf to the Wheel, be made $o $hort and clo$e toge-
ther, that though the de$cent of the moveable be retarded, yea
more, dimini$hed <I>in infinitum,</I> yet it $ufficeth to reconduct it thither:
and therefore it would be requi$ite, that you find out a diminuti-
on of the $aid $paces, not only produced to infinity, but to $uch an
infinity, as that it may $uperate the double infinity that is made in
the diminution of the velocity of the de$cending moveable. But
how can a magnitude be dimini$hed more than another, which
hath a twofold diminution <I>in infinitum</I>? Now let <I>Simplicius</I> ob-
$erve how hard it is to philo$ophate well in nature, without <I>Geo-
metry.</I> The degrees of velocity dimini$hed <I>in infinitum,</I> as well
by the diminution of the gravity of the moveable, as by the ap-
proxination to the fir$t term of the motion, that is, to the $tate

parallels comprehended between two right lines that concur in
an angle, like to the angle B A E, or B A D, or any other
infinitely more acute, alwayes provided it be rectilineall-
But the diminution of the $paces thorow which the moveable is
to be conducted along the circumference of the wheel, is propor-
tionate to another kind of diminution, comprehended between
lines that contain an angle infinitely more narrow and acute, than
any rectilineal angle, how acute $oever, which is that in our pre-
$ent ca$e. Let any point be taken in the perpendicular A C, and
making it the centre, de$cribe at the di$tance C A, an arch A M P,
the which $hall inter$ect the parallels that determine the degrees of
velocity, though they be very minute, and comprehended within
a mo$t acute rectilineal angle; of which parallels the parts that
lie between the arch and the tangent A B, are the quantities of
the $paces, and of the returns upon the wheel, alwayes le$$er (and
with greater proportion le$$er, by how much neerer they approach
to the contact) than the $aid parallels of which they are parts.
The parallels comprehended between the right lines in retiring to-
wards the angle dimini$h alwayes at the $ame rate, as <I>v.g.</I> A H be-
ing divided in two equal parts in F, the parallel H I $hall be dou-
ble to F G, and $ub-dividing F A, in two equal parts, the paral-
lel produced from the point of the divi$ion $hall be the half of
F G; and continuing the $ub-divi$ion <I>in infinitum,</I> the $ub$equent
parallels $hall be alwayes half of the next preceding; but it doth
not $o fall out in the lines intercepted between the tangent and
the circumference of the circle: For if the $ame $ub-divi$ion be
made in F A; and $uppo$ing for example, that the parallel which
cometh from the point H, were double unto that which commeth
from F, this $hall be more then double to the next following, and
continually the neerer we come towards the contact A, we $hall
find the precedent lines contein the next following three, four,
ten, an hundred, a thou$and, an hundred thou$and, an hundred
millions of times, and more <I>in infinitum.</I> The brevity therefore of
$uch lines is $o reduced, that it far exceeds what is requi$ite to make
the project, though never $o light, return, nay more, continue
unremoveable upon the circumference.</P>
<P>SAGR. I very well comprehend the whole di$cour$e, and upon
what it layeth all its $tre$$e, yet neverthele$$e methinks that he
that would take pains to pur$ue it, might yet $tart $ome further
que$tions, by $aying, that of tho$e two cau$es which render the
de$cent of the moveable $lower and $lower <I>in infinitum,</I> it is mani-
fe$t, that that which dependeth on the vicinity to the fir$t term of
the de$cent, increa$eth alwayes in the $ame proportion, like as the
parallels alwayes retain the $ame proportion to each other, &amp;c.
<foot>Z 2 but</foot>
<p n=>180</p>
but that the diminution of the $ame velocity, dependent on the
diminution of the gravity of the moveable (which vvas the $econd
cau$e) doth al$o ob$erve the $ame proportion, doth not $o plainly
appear, And vvho $hall a$$ure us that it doth not proceed accor-
ding to the proportion of the lines intercepted between the $ecant,
and the circumference; or vvhether vvith a greater proportion?</P>
<P>SALV. I have a$$umed for a truth, that the velocities of movea-
bles de$cending naturally, vvill follovv the proportion of their gra-
vities, with the favour of <I>Simplicius,</I> and of <I>Ari$totle,</I> who doth
in many places affirm the $ame, as a propo$ition manife$t: You,
in favour of my adver$ary, bring the $ame into que$tion, and $ay
that its po$$ible that the velocity increa$eth with greater propor-
tion, yea and greater <I>in infinitum</I> than that of the gravity; $o that
all that hath been $aid falleth to the ground: For maintaining
whereof, I $ay, that the proportion of the velocities is much le$$e
than that of the gravities; and thereby I do not onely $upport
but confirme the premi$es. And for proof of this I appeal unto
experience, which will $hew us, that a grave body, howbeit thirty
or fourty times bigger then another; as for example, a ball of
lead, and another of $ugar, will not move much more than twice
as fa$t. Now if the projection would not be made, albeit the ve-
locity of the cadent body $hould dimini$h according to the pro-
portion of the gravity, much le$$e would it be made $o long as the
velocity is but little dimini$hed, by abating much from the gravi-
ty. But yet $uppo$ing that the velocity dimini$heth with a propor-
tion much greater than that wherewith the gravity decrea$eth, nay
though it were the $elf-$ame wherewith tho$e parallels conteined
between the tangent and circumference do decrea$e, yet cannot I
$ee any nece$$ity why I $hould grant the projection of matters of
never $o great levity; yea I farther averre, that there could no $uch
projection follow, meaning alwayes of matters not properly and
ab$olutely light, that is, void of all gravity, and that of their own
natures move upwards, but that de$cend very $lowly, and
have very $mall gravity. And that which moveth me $o to think
is, that the diminution of gravity, made according to the propor-
tion of the parallels between the tangent and the circumference,
hath for its ultimate and highe$t term the nullity of weight, as tho$e
parallels have for their la$t term of their diminution the contact it
$elf, which is an indivi$ible point: Now gravity never dimini$heth
$o far as to its la$t term, for then the moveable would cea$e to be
grave; but yet the $pace of the rever$ion of the project to the
circumference is reduced to the ultimate minuity, which is when
the moveable re$teth upon the circumference in the very point of
contact; $o as that to return thither it hath no need of $pace:
and therefore let the propen$ion to the motion of de$cent be ne-
<foot>ver</foot>
<p n=>181</p>
ver $o $mall, yet is it alwayes more than $ufficient to reconduct the
moveable to the circumference, from which it is di$tant but its lea$t
$pace, that is, nothing at all.</P>
<P>SAGR. Your di$cour$e, I mu$t confe$s, is very accurate; and
yet no le$s concluding than it is ingenuous; and it mu$t be gran-
ted that to go about to handle natural que$tions, without <I>Geome-
try,</I> is to attempt an impo$$ibility.</P>
<P>SALV. But <I>Simplicius</I> will not $ay $o; and yet I do not think
that he is one of tho$e <I>Peripateticks</I> that di$$wade their Di$ciples
from $tudying the <I>Mathematicks,</I> as Sciences that vitiate the rea-
$on, and render it le$$e apt for contemplation.</P>
<P>SIMP. I would not do $o much wrong to <I>Plato,</I> but yet I may
truly $ay with <I>Aristotle,</I> that he too much lo$t him$elf in, and too
much doted upon that his <I>Geometry</I>: for that in conclu$ion the$e
Mathematical $ubtilties <I>Salviatus</I> are true in ab$tract, but applied
to $en$ible and Phy$ical matter, they hold not good. For the
Mathematicians will very well demon$trate for example, that
<I>Sph&aelig;ratangit planum in puncto</I>; a po$ition like to that in di$pute,
but when one cometh to the matter, things $ucceed quite another
way. And $o I may $ay of the$e angles of contact, and the$e
proportions; which all evaporate into Air, when they are applied
to things material and $en$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. You do not think then, that the tangent toucheth the
$uperficies of the terre$trial Globe in one point only?</P>
<P>SIMP. No, not in one $ole point; but I believe that a right
line goeth many tens and hundreds of yards touching the $urface
not onely of the Earth, but of the water, before it $eparate from
the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. But if I grant you this, do not you perceive that it ma-
keth $o much the more again$t your cau$e? For if it be $uppo$ed
that the tangent was $eparated from the terre$trial $uperficies, yet
it hath been however demon$trated that by rea$on of the great a-
cuity of the angle of contingence (if happily it may be call'd an
angle) the project would not $eparate from the $ame; how much
le$$e cau$e of $eparation would it have, if that angle $hould be
wholly clo$ed, and the $uperficies and the tangent become all one?
<marg><I>The truth
$ometimes gaines
$trength by con-

Perceive you not that the Projection would do the $ame thing up-
on the $urface of the Earth, which is a$much as to $ay, it would
do ju$t nothing at all? You $ee then the power of truth, which
while you $trive to oppo$e it, your own a$$aults them$elves uphold
and defend it. But in regard that you have retracted this errour,
I would be loth to leave you in that other which you hold, namely,
that a material Sphere doth not touch a plain in one $ole point:
and I could wi$h $ome few hours conver$ation with $ome per$ons
conver$ant in <I>Geometry,</I> might make you a little more intelligent
<foot>among$t</foot>
<p n=>182</p>
among$t tho$e who know nothing thereof. Now to $hew you how
great their errour is who $ay, that a Sphere <I>v.g.</I> of bra$$e, doth not
touch a plain <I>v.g.</I> of $teel in one $ole point, Tell me what con-
ceipt you would entertain of one that $hould con$tantly aver, that
the Sphere is not truly a Sphere.</P>
<P>SIMP. I would e$teem him wholly devoid of rea$on.</P>
<P>SALV. He is in the $ame ca$e who $aith that the material Sphere
<marg><I>The sphere al-

rial plane but in

doth not touch a plain, al$o material, in one onely point; for to
$ay this is the $ame, as to affirm that the Sphere is not a Sphere.
And that this is true, tell me in what it is that you con$titute the
Sphere to con$i$t, that is, what it is that maketh the Sphere differ
from all other $olid bodies.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that the e$$ence of a Sphere con$i$teth in ha-

ving all the right lines produced from its centre to the circumfe-
rence, equal.</P>
<P>SALV. So that, if tho$e lines $hould not be equal, there $ame
$olidity would be no longer a $phere?</P>
<P>SIMP. True.</P>
<P>SALV. Go to; tell me whether you believe that among$t the
many lines that may be drawn between two points, that may be
more than one right line onely.</P>
<P>SIMP. There can be but one.</P>
<P>SALV. But yet you under$tand that this onely right line $hall
again of nece$$ity be the $horte$t of them all?</P>
<P>SIMP. I know it, and al$o have a demon$tration thereof, pro-
duced by a great <I>Peripatetick</I> Philo$opher, and as I take it, if my
memory do not deceive me, he alledgeth it by way of reprehending
<I>Archimedes,</I> that $uppo$eth it as known, when it may be demon-
$trated.</P>
<P>SALV. This mu$t needs be a great Mathematician, that knew
how to demon$trate that which <I>Archimedes</I> neither did, nor could
demon$trate. And if you remember his demon$tration, I would
gladly hear it: for I remember very well, that <I>Archimedes</I> in his
Books, <I>de Sph&aelig;r&agrave; &amp; Cylindro,</I> placeth this Propo$ition among$t the
<I>Po$tulata</I>; and I verily believe that he thought it demon$trated.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think I $hall remember it, for it is very ea$ie and
$hort.</P>
<P>SALV. The di$grace of <I>Archimedes,</I> and the honour of this Phi-
lo$opher $hall be $o much the greater.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will de$cribe the Figure of it. Between the points

than this, to give an example of the mo$t $olemn fallacy of all
fallacies, namely, than that which proveth <I>ignotum per ignotius.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. How $o?</P>
<P>SALV. Do you ask me how $o? The unknown conclu$ion
which you de$ire to prove, is it not, that the curved line A C B, is
longer than the right line A B; the middle term which is taken
for known, is that the curve-line A C B, is greater than the two
lines A C and C B, the which are known to be greater than A B;
And if it be unknown whether the curve-line be greater than the
$ingle right-line A B, $hall it not be much more unknown whether
it be greater than the two right lines A C &amp; C B, which are known
to be greater than the $ole line A B, &amp; yet you a$$ume it as known?</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not yet very well perceive wherein lyeth the fal-
lacy.</P>
<P>SALV. As the two right lines are greater than A B, (as may be
known by <I>Euclid</I>) and in as much as the curve line is longer than
the two right lines A C and B C, $hall it not not be much greater
than the $ole right line A B?</P>
<P>SIMP. It $hall $o.</P>
<P>SALV. That the curve-line A C B, is greater than the right
line A B, is the conclu$ion more known than the middle term,
which is, that the $ame curve-line is greater than the two right-
lines A C and C B. Now when the middle term is le$s known
than the conclu$ion, it is called a proving <I>ignotum per ignotius.</I>
But to return to our purpo$e, it is $ufficient that you know the
right line to be the $horte$t of all the lines that can be drawn be-
tween two points. And as to the principal conclu$ion, you $ay,
that the material $phere doth not touch the $phere in one $ole
point. What then is its contact?</P>
<P>SIMP. It $hall be a part of its $uperficies.</P>
<P>SALV. And the contact likewi$e of another $phere equal to the
fir$t, $hall be al$o a like particle of its $uperficies?</P>
<P>SIMP. There is no rea$on vvhy it $hould be othervvi$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Then the tvvo $pheres vvhich touch each other, $hall
touch vvith the tvvo $ame particles of a $uperficies, for each of them
agreeing to one and the $ame plane, they mu$t of nece$$ity agree
in like manner to each other. Imagine now that the two $pheres
<marg><I>A demon $tration
that the $phere tou-
cheth the plane but

[<I>in Fig.</I> 6.] who$e centres are A and B, do touch one another:
and let their centres be conjoyned by the right line A B, which
pa$$eth through the contact. It pa$$eth thorow the point C, and
<foot>another</foot>
<p n=>184</p>
another point in the contact being taken as D, conjoyn the two
right lines A D and B D, $o as that they make the triangle A D B;
of which the two $ides A D and D B $hall be equal to the other one
A C B, both tho$e and this containing two $emidiameters, which
by the definition of the $phere are all equal: and thus the right
line A B, drawn between the two centres A and B, $hall not be the
$horte$t of all, the two lines A D and D B being equal to it: which
by your own conce$$ion is ab$urd.</P>
<P>SIMP. This demon$tration holdeth in the ab$tracted, but not in
the material $pheres.</P>
<P>SALV. In$tance then wherein the fallacy of my argument con-
$i$teth, if as you $ay it is not concluding in the material $pheres, but
holdeth good in the immaterial and ab$tracted.</P>
<marg><I>Why the $phere in
ab$tract, toucheth
the plane onely in
one point, and not
the material in
conerete.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. The material $pheres are $ubject to many accidents,
which the immaterial are free from. And becau$e it cannot be,
that a $phere of metal pa$$ing along a plane, its own weight $hould
not $o depre$s it, as that the plain $hould yield $omewhat, or that
the $phere it $elf $hould not in the contact admit of $ome impre$$i-
on. Moreover, it is very hard for that plane to be perfect, if for
nothing el$e, yet at lea$t for that its matter is porous: and per-
haps it will be no le$s difficult to find a $phere $o perfect, as that
it hath all the lines from the centre to the $uperficies, exactly
equal.</P>
<P>SALV. I very readily grant you all this that you have $aid; but
it is very much be$ide our purpo$e: for whil$t you go about to
$hew me that a material $phere toucheth not a material plane in
one point alone, you make u$e of a $phere that is not a $phere, and
of a plane that is not a plane; for that, according to what you
$ay, either the$e things cannot be found in the world, or if they
may be found, they are $poiled in applying them to work the effect.
It had been therefore a le$s evil, for you to have granted the con-
clu$ion, but conditionally, to wit, that if there could be made of
matter a $phere and a plane that were and could continue perfect,
they would touch in one $ole point, and then to have denied that
any $uch could be made.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that the propo$ition of Philo$ophers is to be
under$tood in this $en$e; for it is not to be doubted, but that the
imperfection of the matter, maketh the matters taken in con-
crete, to di$agree with tho$e taken in ab$tract.</P>
<P>SALV. What, do they not agree? Why, that which you your
$elf $ay at this in$tant, proveth that they punctually agree.</P>
<P>SIMP. How can that be?</P>
<P>SALV. Do you not $ay, that through the imperfection of the
matter, that body which ought to be perfectly $pherical, and that
plane which ought to be perfectly level, do not prove to be the
<foot>$ame</foot>
<p n=>185</p>
$ame in concrete, as they are imagined to be in ab$tract?</P>
<P>SIMP. This I do affirm.</P>
<P>SALV. Then when ever in concrete you do apply a material Sphere
<marg><I>Things are ex-
actly the $ame in
ab$tract as in con-
crete.</I></marg>
to a material plane, youapply an imperfect Sphere to an imperfect
plane, &amp; the$e you $ay do not touch only in one point. But I mu$t
tell you, that even in ab$tract an immaterial Sphere, that is, not a
perfect Sphere, may touch an immaterial plane, that is, not a per-
fect plane, not in one point, but with part of its $uperficies, $o that
hitherto that which falleth out in concrete, doth in like manner
hold true in ab$tract. And it would be a new thing that the com-
putations and rates made in ab$tract numbers, $hould not after-
wards an$wer to the Coines of Gold and Silver, and to the mer-
chandizes in concrete. But do you know <I>Simplicius,</I> how this
commeth to pa$$e? Like as to make that the computations agree
with the Sugars, the Silks, the Wools, it is nece$$ary that the
accomptant reckon his tares of che$ts, bags, and $uch other things:
So when the <I>Geometricall Philo$opher</I> would ob$erve in concrete
the effects demon$trated in ab$tract, he mu$t defalke the impedi-
ments of the matter, and if he know how to do that, I do a$$ure
you, the things $hall jump no le$$e exactly, than <I>Arithmstical</I>
computations. The errours therefore lyeth neither in ab$tract, nor
in concrete, nor in <I>Geometry,</I> nor in <I>Phy$icks,</I> but in the Calcula-
tor, that knoweth not how to adju$t his accompts. Therefore if
you had a perfect Sphere and plane, though they were material,
you need not doubt but that they would touch onely in one point.
And if $uch a Sphere was and is impo$$ible to be procured, it was
much be$ides the purpo$e to $ay, <I>Quod Sph&aelig;ra &aelig;nea non tangit in
puncto.</I> Furthermore, if I grant you <I>Simplicius,</I> that in matter a
figure cannot be procured that is perfectly $pherical, or perfectly
level: Do you think there may be had two materiall bodies,
who$e $uperficies in $ome part, and in $ome $ort are incurvated as
irregularly as can be de$ired?</P>
<P>SIMP. Of the$e I believe that there is no want.</P>
<P>SALV. If $uch there be, then they al$o will touch in one $ole
<marg><I>Contact in a $in-

point; for this contact in but one point alone is not the $ole and
peculiar priviledge of the perfect Sphere and perfect plane. Nay, he
that $hould pro$ecute this point with more $ubtil contemplations
would finde that it is much harder to procure two bodies that
<marg><I>It is more diffi-
cult to find Figures
that touch with a
part of their $ur-
face, than in one
$ole point.</I></marg>
touch with part of their $nper$icies, than with one point onely.
For if two $uperficies be required to combine well together, it is
nece$$ary either, that they be both exactly plane, or that if one be
convex, the other be concave; but in $uch a manner concave,
that the concavity do exactly an$wer to the convexity of the other:
the which conditions are much harder to be found, in regard of
their too narrow determination, than tho$e others, which in their
ca$uall latitude are infinite.</P>

becau$e for the mo$t part there will be $ome $mall yielding filth
upon them, as becau$e that no diligence is u$ed in applying them

were very ter$e and polite, and that they were both laid upon a

<P>SAGR. It is requi$ite, with your permi$$ion, that I propound a
certain $cruple of mine, which came into my minde, whil'$t I heard
propo$ed by <I>Simplicius,</I> the impo$$ibility of finding a materiall
and $olid body, that is, perfectly of a Spherical figure, and whil'$t
J law <I>Salviatus</I> in a certain manner, not gain$aying, to give his
con$ent thereto; therefore I would know, whether there would
be the $ame difficulty in forming a $olid of $ome other figure, that
is, to expre$$e my $elf better, whether there is more difficulty in
reducing a piece of Marble into the figure of a perfect Sphere, than
into a perfect Pyramid, or into a perfect Hor$e, or into a perfect
Gra$$e-hopper?</P>
<P>SALV. To this I will make you the fir$t an$wer: and in the
fir$t place, I will acquit my $elf of the a$$ent which you think I
gave to <I>Simplicius,</I> which was only for a time; for I had it al$o in
my thoughts, betore I intended to enter upon any other matter, to
$peak that, which, it may be, is the $ame, or very like to that which
you are about to $ay, And an$wering to your fir$t que$tion, I $ay,
<marg><I>The Sphericall
Figure is ea$ier to
be made than any
other.</I></marg>
that if any figure can be given to a Solid, the Spherical is the ea$i-
e$t of all others, as it is likewi$e the mo$t $imple, and holdeth the
$ame place among$t $olid figures, as the Circle holdeth among$t

the $uperficial. The de$cription of which Circle, as being more ea-

worthy to be put among$t the ^{*} <I>po$tulata</I> belonging to the de$cri-

ption of all other figures. And the formation of the Sphere is
$o very ea$ie, that if in a plain plate of hard metal you take an
empty or hollow circle, within which any Solid goeth ca$ually re-
volving that was before but gro$ly rounded, it $hall, without any
other artifice be reduced to a Spherical figure, as perfect as is po$-
$ible for it to be; provided, that that $ame Solid be not le$$e than
the Sphere that would pa$$e thorow that Circle. And that which is
yet more worthy of our con$ideration is, that within the $elf-$ame
<foot>incavity</foot>

is required to the making of an Hor$e, or (as you $ay) of a Gra$s-
hopper, I leave to you to judge, who know that there are but few
$tatuaries in the world able to undertake $uch a piece of work.
And I think that herein <I>Simplicius</I> will not di$$ent from me.</P>
<P>SIMP. I know not whether I do at all diffent from you; my
opinion is this, that none of the afore-named figures can be per-
fectly obteined; but for the approaching as neer as is po$$ible to
the mo$t perfect degree, I believe that it is incomparably more ea-
$ie to reduce the Solid into a Spherical figure, than into the $hape
of an Hor$e, or Gra$$e-hopper?</P>
<P>SAGR. And this greater difficulty, wherein think you doth it
depend?</P>
<P>SIMP. Like as the great facility in forming the Sphere ari$eth
<marg><I>Irregular forms
difficult to be in-
troduced.</I></marg>
from its ab$olute $implicity and uniformity $o the great irregu-
larity rendereth the con$truction of all other figures difficult.</P>
<P>SAGR. Therefore the irregularity being the cau$e of the diffi-
culty, than the figure of a $tone broken with an hammer by
chance, $hall be one of the figures that are difficult to be introdu-
ced, it being perhaps more irregular than that of the hor$e?</P>
<P>SIMP. So it $hould be.</P>
<P>SAGR. But tell me; that figure what ever it is which the $tone
hath, hath it the $ame in perfection, or no?</P>
<P>SIMP. What it hath, it hath $o perfectly, that nothing can be
more exact.</P>
<P>SAGR. Then, if of figures that are irregular, and con$equent-
ly hard to be procured, there are yet infinite which are mo$t per-
fectly obteined, with what rea$on can it be $aid, that the mo$t
$imple, and con$equently the mo$t ea$ie of all, is impo$$ible to be
procured?</P>
<P>SALV. Gentlemen, with your favour, I may $ay that we have
$allied out into a di$pute not much more worth than the wool of a
goat; and whereas our argumentations $hould continually be con-
ver$ant about $erious and weighty points, we con$ume our time in
<marg><I>The con$titution
of the Univer$e is
one of the mo$t no-

frivolous and impertinent wranglings. Let us call to minde, I pray
you, that the $earch of the worlds con$titution, is one of the grea-
te$t and noble$t Problems that are in nature; and $o much the
greater, ina$much as it is directed to the re$olving of that other;
to wit, of the cau$e of the Seas ebbing and flowing, enquired in-
to by all the famous men, that have hitherto been in the world,
and po$$ibly found out by none of them. Therefore if we have
nothing more remaining for the full confutation of the argument
taken from the Earths <I>vertigo,</I> which was the la$t, alledged to
prove its immobility upon its own centre, let us pa$$e to the ex-
amination of tho$e things that are alledged for, and again$t the
<I>Annual Motion.</I></P>
<foot>Aa2 SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>188</p>
<P>SAGR. I would not have you, <I>Salviatus,</I> mea$ure our wits by
the $cale of yours: you, who u$e to be continually bu$ied about
the $ublime$t contemplations, e$teem tho$e notions frivolous and
below you, which we think matters worthy of our profounde$t
thoughts: yet $ometimes for our $atisfaction do not di$dain to
$toop $o low as to give way a little to our curio$ity. As to the
refutation of the la$t argument, taken from the extru$ions of the
diurnal <I>vertigo,</I> far le$s than what hath been $aid, would have
given me $atisfaction: and yet the things $uperfluou$ly $poken,
$eemed to me $o ingenious, that they have been $o far from wea-
rying my fancy, as that they have, by rea$on of their novelty, en-
tertained me all along with $o great delight, that I know not how
to de$ire greater: Therefore, if you have any other $peculation
to add, produce it, for I, as to my own particular, $hall gladly
hearken to it.</P>
<P>SALV. I have always taken great delight in tho$e things which
I have had the fortune to di$cover, and next to that, which is my
chief content, I find great plea$ure in imparting them to $ome
friends, that apprehendeth and $eemeth to like them: Now, in re-
gard you are one of the$e, $lacking a little the reins of my ambi-
tion, which is much plea$ed when I $hew my $elf more per$pi-
cacious, than $ome other that hath the reputation of a $harp
$ight, I will for a full and true mea$ure of the pa$t di$pute, pro-
duce another fallacy of the Sectators of <I>Ptolomey</I> and <I>Ari$totle,</I>
which I take from the argument alledged.</P>
<P>SAGR. See how greedily I wait to hear it.</P>
<P>SALV. We have hitherto over-pa$$ed, and granted to <I>Ptolomey,</I>
as an effect indubitable, that the extru$ion of the $tone proceed-
ing from the velocity of the wheel turn'd round upon its centre,
the cau$e of the $aid extru$ion encrea$eth in proportion, as the ve-
locity of the <I>vertigo</I> (or whirling) is augmented: from whence
it was inferred, that the velocity of the Earth's <I>vertigo</I> being
very much greater than that of any machin what$oever, that we
can make to turn round artificially; the extru$ion of $tones, of
animals, &amp;c. would con$equently be far more violent. Now, I
ob$erve that there is a great fallacy in this di$cour$e, in that we do
compare the$e velocities indifferently and ab$olutely to one ano-
ther. It's true, that if I compare the velocities of the $ame wheel,
or of two wheels equal to each other, that which $hall be more
$wiftly turn'd round, $hall extrude the $tone with greater vio-
lence; and the velocity encrea$ing, the cau$e of the projection
$hall likewi$e encrea$e: but when the velocity is augmented, not
by encrea$ing the velocity in the $ame wheel, which would be by
cau$ing it to make a greater number of revolutions in equal times;
but by encrea$ing the diameter, and making the wheel greater, $o
as that the conver$ion taking up the $ame time in the le$$er wheel,
<foot>as</foot>
<p n=>189</p>
as in the greater, the velocity is greater onely in the bigger wheel,
<marg><I>The cau$e of the
projection increa$-
eth not according
to the proportion of
the velocity, in-
crea$ed by making
the wheel bigger.</I></marg>
for that its circumference is bigger; there is no man that thinketh
that the cau$e of the extru$ion in the great wheel will encrea$e ac-
cording to the proportion of the velocity of its circumference, to
the velocity of the circumference of the other le$$er wheel; for that
this is mo$t fal$e, as by a mo$t expeditious experiment I $hall thus
gro$ly declare: We may $ling a $tone with a $tick of a yard long,
farther than we can do with a $tick $ix yards long, though
the motion of the end of the long $tick, that is of the $tone placed
in the $lit thereof, were more than double as $wift as the mo-
tion of the end of the other $horter $tick, as it would be if
the velocities were $uch that the le$$er $tick $hould turn thrice
round in the time whil$t the greater is making one onely con-
ver$ion.</P>
<P>SAGR. This which you tell me, <I>Salviatus,</I> mu$t, I $ee, needs
$ucceed in this very manner; but I do not $o readily apprehend
the cau$e why equal velocities $hould not operate equally in
extruding projects, but that of the le$$er wheel much more than
the other of the greater wheel; therefore I intreat you to tell me
how this cometh to pa$s.</P>
<P>SIMP. Herein, <I>Sagredus,</I> you $eem to differ much from your
$elf, for that you were wont to penetrate all things in an in$tant,
and now you have overlook'd a fallacy couched in the experiment
of the $tick, which I my $elf have been able to di$cover: and this
is the different manner of operating, in making the projection one
while with the $hort $ling and another while with the long one,
for if you will have the $tone fly out of the $lit, you need not con-
tinue its motion uniformly, but at $uch time as it is at the $wifte$t,
you are to $tay your arm, and $top the velocity of the $tick; where-
upon the $tone which was in its $wifte$t motion, flyeth out, and
moveth with impetuo$ity: but now that $top cannot be made in
the great $tick, which by rea$on of its length and flexibility, doth
not entirely obey the check of the arm, but continueth to accom-
pany the $tone for $ome $pace, and holdeth it in with $o much le$s
force, and not as if you had with a $tiff $ling $ent it going with a
jerk: for if both the $ticks or $lings $hould be check'd by one and
the $ame ob$tacle, I do believe they would fly a$well out of the
one, as out of the other, howbeit their motions were equally
$wift.</P>
<P>SAGR. With the permi$$ion of <I>Salviatus,</I> I will an$wer $ome-
thing to <I>Simplicius,</I> in regard he hath addre$$ed him$elf to me;
and I $ay, that in his di$cour$e there is $omewhat good
and $omewhat bad: good, becau$e it is almo$t all true;
bad, becau$e it doth not agree with our ca$e: Truth is, that when
that which carrieth the $tones with velocity, $hall meet with a
<foot>check</foot>
<p n=>190</p>
check that is immoveable, they $hall fly out with great impetuo-
$ity: the $ame effect following in that ca$e, which we $ee dayly
to fall out in a boat that running a $wift cour$e, runs a-ground, or
meets with $ome $udden $top, for all tho$e in the boat, being $ur-
<marg><I>Graming the di-

prized, $tumble forwards, and fall towards the part whither the
boat $teered. And in ca$e the Earth $hould meet with $uch a
check, as $hould be able to re$i$t and arre$t its <I>vertigo,</I> then indeed
I do believe that not onely bea$ts, buildings and cities, but moun-
tains, lakes and $eas would overturn, and the globe it $elf would
go near to $hake in pieces; but nothing of all this concerns our
pre$ent purpo$e, for we $peak of what may follow to the motion
of the Earth, it being turn'd round uniformly, and quietly about
its own centre, howbeit with a great velocity. That likewi$e
which you $ay of the $lings, is true in part; but was not alledged
by <I>Salviatus,</I> as a thing that punctually agreed with the matter
whereof we treat, but onely, as an example, for $o in gro$s it may
prompt us in the more accurate con$ideration of that point, whe-
ther, the velocity increa$ing at any rate, the cau$e of the proje-
ction doth increa$e at the $ame rate: $o that <I>v. g.</I> if a wheel of
ten yards diameter, moving in $uch a manner that a point of its
circumference will pa$s an hundred yards in a minute of an hour,
and $o hath an <I>impetus</I> able to extrude a $tone, that $ame <I>impetus</I>
$hall be increa$ed an hundred thou$and times in a wheel of a million
of yards diameter; the which <I>Salviatus</I> denieth, and I incline to his
opinion; but not knowing the rea$on thereof, I have reque$ted it
of him, and $tand impatiently expecting it.</P>
<P>SALV. I am ready to give you the be$t $atisfaction, that my
abilities will give leave: And though in my fir$t di$cour$e you
thought that I had enquired into things e$tranged from our pur-
po$e, yet neverthele$$e I believe that in the $equel of the di$pute,
you will find that they do not prove $o. Therefore let <I>Sagredus</I>
tell me wherein he hath ob$erved that the re$i$tance of any move-
able to motion doth con$i$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $ee not for the pre$ent that the moveable hath any
internal re$i$tance to motion, unle$$e it be its natural inclination
and propen$ion to the contrary motion, as in grave bodies, that
have a propen$ion to the motion downwards, the re$i$tance is to
the motion upwards; and I $aid an internal re$i$tance, becau$e
of this, I think, it is you intend to $peak, and not of the external
re$i$tances, which are many and accidental.</P>
<P>SALV. It is that indeed I mean, and your nimblene$$e of wit
hath been too hard for my craftine$$e, but if I have been too
$hort in asking the que$tion, I doubt whether <I>Sagredus</I> hath been
full enough in his an$wer to $atis$ie the demand; and whether
there be not in the moveable, be$ides the natural inclination to the
<foot>contrary</foot>
<p n=>191</p>

<marg><I>The inclination of

keth it aver$e to motion. Therefore tell me again; do you not
think that the inclination <I>v. g.</I> of grave bodies to move down-
wards, is equal to the re$i$tance of the $ame to the motion of pro-
jection upwards?</P>
<P>SAGR. I believe that it is exactly the $ame. And for this rea$on
I $ee that two equal weights being put into a ballance, they do
$tand $till in <I>equilibrium,</I> the gravity of the one re$i$ting its be-
ing rai$ed by the gravity wherewith the other pre$$ing down-
wards would rai$e it.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well; $o that if you would have one rai$e up the
other, you mu$t encrea$e the weight of that which depre$$eth,
or le$$en the weight of the other. But if the re$i$tance to a$cend-
ing motion cun$i$t onely in gravity, how cometh it to pa$$e, that

in ballances of unequal arms, to wit in the ^{*} <I>Stiliard,</I> a weight
$ometimes of an hundred pounds, with its pre$$ion downwards,
doth not $uffice to rai$e up on of four pounds; that $hall counter-
poi$e with it, nay this of four, de$cending $hall rai$e up that
of an hundred; for $uch is the effect of the pendant weight upon
the weight which we would weigh? If the re$i$tance to motion
re$ideth onely in the gravity, how can the arm with its weight of
four pounds onely, re$i$t the weight of a $ack of wool, or bale of
$ilk, which $hall be eight hundred, or a thou$and weight; yea
more, how can it overcome the $ack with its moment, and rai$e
it up? It mu$t therefore be confe$t <I>Sagredus,</I> that here it maketh
u$e of $ome other re$i$tance, and other force, be$ides that of
$imple gravity.</P>
<P>SAGR. It mu$t needs be $o; therefore tell me what this $e-
cond virtue $hould be.</P>
<P>SALV. It is that which was not in the ballance of equal
arms; you $ee then what variety there is in the Stiliard; and up-
on this doubtle$$e dependeth the cau$e of the new effect.</P>
<P>SAGR. I think that your putting me to it a $econd time, hath
made me remember $omething that may be to the purpo$e. In
both the$e beams the bu$ine$s is done by the weight, and by the
motion; in the ballance, the motions are equal, and therefore the
one weight mu$t exceed it in gravity before it can move it; in the
$tiliard, the le$$er weight will not move the greater, unle$s when
this latter moveth little, as being $lung at a le$$er di$tance, and the
other much, as hanging at a greater di$tance from the lacquet or
cock. It is nece$$ary therefore to conclude, that the le$$er weight
overcometh the re$i$tance of the greater, by moving much, whil$t
the other is moved but little.</P>
<P>SALV. Which is as much as to $ay, that the velocity of the
moveable le$s grave, compen$ateth the gravity of the moveable
more grave and le$s $wift.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>192</p>
<marg><I>The greater velo-

<P>SAGR. But do you think that the velocity doth fully make
good the gravity? that is, that the moment and force of a move-
able of <I>v. g.</I> four pounds weight, is as great as that of one of an
hundred weight, when$oever that the fir$t hath an hundred degrees
of velocity, and the later but four onely?</P>
<P>SALV. Yes doubtle$s, as I am able by many experiments to
demon$trate: but for the pre$ent, let this onely of the $tiliard
$uffice: in which you $ee that the light end of the beam is then
able to $u$tain and equilibrate the great Wool $ack, when its di-
$tance from the centre, upon which the $tiliard re$teth and turn-
eth, $hall $o much exceed the le$$er di$tance, by how much the ab-
$olute gravity of the Wool-$ack exceedeth that of the pendent
weight. And we $ee nothing that can cau$e this in$ufficiencie in
the great $ack of Wool, to rai$e with its weight the pendent
weight $o much le$s grave, $ave the di$parity of the motions which
the one and the other $hould make, whil$t that the Wool $ack by
de$cending but one inch onely, will rai$e the pendent weight an
hundred inclies: ($uppo$ing that the $ack did weigh an hundred
times as much, and that the di$tance of the $mall weight from the
centre of the beam were an hundred times greater, than the di-
$tance between the $aid centre and the point of the $acks $u$pen$i-
on.) And again, the pendent weight its moving the $pace of an
hundred inches, in the time that the $ack moveth but one inch
onely, is the $ame as to $ay, that the velocity of the motion of the
little pendent weight, is an hundred times greater than the velo-
city of the motion of the $ack. Now fix it in your belief, as a
true and manife$t axiom, that the re$i$tance which proceedeth from
the velocity of motion, compen$ateth that which dependeth on
the gravity of another moveable: So that con$equently, a move-
able of one pound, that moveth with an hundred degrees of ve-
locity, doth as much re$i$t all ob$truction, as another moveable
of an hundred weight, who$e velocity is but one degree onely.
And two equal moveables will equally re$i$t their being moved,
if that they $hall be moved with equal velocity: but if one be
to be moved more $wiftly than the other, it $hall make greater re-
$i$tance, according to the greater velocity that $hall be conferred
on it. The$e things being premi$ed, let us proceed to the expla-
nation of our Problem; and for the better under$tanding of
things, let us make a $hort Scheme thereof. Let two unequal
wheels be de$cribed about this centre A, [<I>in Fig.</I> 7.] and let the
circumference of the le$$er be B G, and of the greater C E H, and
let the $emidiameter A B C, be perpendicular to the Horizon; and
by the points B and C, let us draw the right lined Tangents B F
and C D; and in the arches B G and C E, take two equal parts
B G and C E: and let the two wheels be $uppo$ed to be turn'd
<foot>round</foot>
<p n=>193</p>
round upon their centres with equal velocities, $o as that two mo-
veables, which $uppo$e for example to be two $tones placed in the
points B and C, come to be carried along the circumferences B G
and C E, with equal velocities; $o that in the $ame time that the
$tone B $hall have run the arch B G, the $tone C will have pa$t the
arch C E. I $ay now, that the whirl or <I>vertigo</I> of the le$$er wheel
is much more potent to make the projection of the $tone B, than
the <I>vertigo</I> of the bigger wheel to make that of the $tone C.
Therefore the projection, as we have already declared, being to be
made along the tangent, when the $tones B and C are to $eparate
from their wheels, and to begin the motion of projection from the
points B and C, then $hall they be extruded by the <I>impetus</I> con-
ceived from the <I>vertigo</I> by (or along) the tangents B F and C D.
The two $tones therefore have equal impetuo$ities of running a-
long the tangents B F and C D, and would run along the $ame, if
they were not turn'd a$ide by $ome other force: is it not $o <I>Sa-
gredus</I>?</P>
<P>SAGR. In my opinion the bu$ine$$e is as you $ay.</P>
<P>SALV. But what force, think you, $hould that be which averts
the $tones from moving by the tangents, along which they are cer-
tainly driven by the <I>impetus</I> of the <I>vertigo.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. It is either their own gravity, or el$e $ome glutinous
matter that holdeth them fa$t and clo$e to the wheels.</P>
<P>SALV. But for the diverting of a moveable from the motion
to which nature inciteth it, is there not required greater or le$$er
force, according as the deviation is intended to be greater or le$-
$er? that is, according as the $aid moveable in its deviation hath a
greater or le$$er $pace to move in the $ame time?</P>
<P>SAGR. Yes certainly: for it was concluded even now, that to
make a moveable to move; the movent vertue mu$t be increa$ed
in proportion to the velocity wherewith it is to move.</P>
<P>SALV. Now con$ider, that for the deviating the $tone upon
the le$$e wheel from the motion of projection, which it would
make by the tangent B F, and for the holding of it fa$t to the
wheel, it is required, that its own gravity draw it back the whole
length of the $ecant F G, or of the perpendicular rai$ed from the
point G, to the line B F, whereas in the greater wheel the retracti-
on needs to be no more than the $ecant D E, or the perpendicu-
lar let fall from the tangent D G to the point E, le$$e by much
than F G, and alwayes le$$er and le$$er according as the wheel is
made bigger. And fora$much as the$e retractions (as I may call
them) are required to be made in equal times, that is, whil'$t the
wheels pa$$e the two equal arches B G and C E, that of the $tone
B, that is, the retraction F G ought to be more $wift than the o-
ther D E; and therefore much greater force will be required for
<foot>Bb holding</foot>
<p n=>194</p>
holding fa$t the $tone B to its little wheel, than for the holding
the $tone C to its great one, which is as much as to $ay, that $uch
a $mall thing will impede the extru$ion in the great wheel, as will
not at all hinder it in the little one. It is manife$t therefore that
the more the wheel augmenteth, the more the cau$e of the pro-
jection dimini$heth.</P>
<P>SAGR. From this which I now under$tand, by help of your mi-
nute di$$ertation, I am induced to think, that I am able to $atisfie
my judgment in a very few words. For equal <I>impetus</I> being im-
pre$$ed on both the $tones that move along the tangents, by the
equal velocity of the two wheels, we $ee the great circumference,
by means of its $mall deviation from the tangent, to go $econding,
as it were, and in a fair way refraining in the $tone the appetite, if
I may $o $ay, of $eparating from the circumference; $o that any
$mall retention, either of its own inclination, or of $ome glutina-
tion $ufficeth to hold it fa$t to the wheel. Which, again, is not a-
ble to work the like effect in the little wheel, which but little pro-

the greater wheel, it ^{*} breaks loo$e, and runneth along the tan-
gent. Therefore I do not only finde that all tho$e have erred,
who have believed the cau$e of the projection to increa$e accor-
ding to the augmentation of the <I>vertigo's</I> velocity; but I am
further thinking, that the projection dimini$hing in the inlarging of
the wheel, $o long as the $ame velocity is reteined in tho$e wheels;
it may po$$ibly be true, that he that would make the great wheel
extrude things like the little one, would be forced to increa$e
them as much in velocity, as they increa$e in diameter, which he
might do, by making them to fini$h their conver$ions in equal
times; and thus we may conclude, that the Earths revolution or
<I>vertigo</I> would be no more able to extrude $tones, than any little
wheel that goeth $o $lowly, as that it maketh but one turn in twen-
ty four hours.</P>
<P>SALV. We will enquire no further into this point for the pre-
$ent: let it $uffice that we have abundantly (if I deceive not my
$elf) demon$trated the invalidity of the argument, which at fir$t
$ight $eemed very concluding, and was $o held by very famous
men: and I $hall think my time and words well be$towed, if I
have but gained $ome belief in the opinion of <I>Simplicius,</I> I will
not $ay or the Earths mobility, but only that the opinion of tho$e
that believe it, is not $o ridiculous and fond, as the rout of vulgar
Philo$ophers e$teem it.</P>

the Comets, but al$o the new $tars, namely, that <I>anno</I> 1572. in

gain$t <I>Tycho, Kepler,</I> and many other Aftronomical Ob$ervators,
and beateth them at their own weapon; to wit, the Doctrine of
Parallaxes. If you like thereof, I will give you the rea$ons of
both the$e Authours, for I have read them more than once,
with attention; and you may examine their $trength, and give
your opinion thereon.</P>
<P>SALV. In regard that our principal end is to bring upon the
$tage, and to con$ider what ever hath been $aid for, or again$t the
two Sy$temes, <I>Ptolomaick,</I> and <I>Copernican,</I> it is not good to omit
any thing that hath been written on this $ubject.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will begin therefore with the objections which I finde
in the Treati$e of Conclu$ions, and afterwards proceed to the
<marg><I>The fir$t obje-

re$t. In the fir$t place then, he be$toweth much paines in calcu-
lating exactly how many miles an hour a point of the terre$trial
Globe $ituate under the Equinoctial, goeth, and how many miles
are pa$t by other points $ituate in other parallels: and not being
content with finding out $uch motions in horary times, he findeth
them al$o in a minute of an hour; and not contenting him$elf
with a minute, he findes them al$o in a $econd minute; yea more,
he goeth on to $hew plainly, how many miles a Cannon bullet
would go in the $ame time, being placed in the concave of the Lu-
<marg><I>A Cannon bul-
let would $pend
more than $ix days
in falling from the
Concave of the

nar Orb, $uppo$ing it al$o as big as <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf repre$enteth
it, to take away all $ubterfuges from his adver$ary. And having
made this mo$t ingenious and exqui$ite $upputation, he $heweth,
that a grave body falling from thence above would con$ume more
than $ix dayes in attaining to the centre of the Earth, to which all
grave bodies naturally move. Now if by the ab$olute Divine
<foot>Bb 2 Power</foot>
<p n=>196</p>
Power, or by $ome Angel, a very great Cannon bullet were carri-
ed up thither, and placed in our Zenith or vertical point, and from
thence let go at liberty, it is in his, and al$o in my opinion, a mo$t
incredible thing that it, in de$cending downwards, $hould all the
way maintain it $elf in our vertical line, continuing to turn round
with the Earth, about its centre, for $o many dayes, de$cribing
under the Equinoctial a Spiral line in the plain of the great circle
it $elf: and under other Parallels, Spiral lines about Cones, and
under the Poles falling by a $imple right line. He, in the next
place, $tabli$heth and confirmeth this great improbability by pro-
ving, in the way of interrogations, many difficulties impo$$ible to
be removed by the followers of <I>Copernicus</I>; and they are, if I do
well remember-----.</P>
<P>SALV. Take up a little, good <I>Simplicius,</I> and do not load me
with $o many novelties at once: I have but a bad memory, and
therefore I mu$t not go too fa$t. And in regard it cometh into
my minde, that I once undertook to calculate how long time $uch a
grave body falling from the concave of the Moon, would be in
pa$$ing to the centre of the Earth, and that I think I remember
that the time would not be $o long; it would be fit that you $hew
us by what rule this Author made his calculation.</P>
<P>SIMP. He hath done it by proving his intent <I>&agrave; fortiori,</I> a $uffi-
cient advantage for his adver$aries, $uppo$ing that the velocity of
the body falling along the vertical line, towards the centre of the
Earth, were equal to the velocity of its circular motion, which it
made in the grand circle of the concave of the Lunar Orb.
Which by equation would come to pa$$e in an hour, twelve thou-
$and $ix hundred German miles, a thing which indeed $avours of
impo$$ibility: Yet neverthele$$e, to $hew his abundant caution,
and to give all advantages to his adver$aries, he $uppo$eth it for
true, and concludeth, that the time o$ the fall ought however to
be more than $ix dayes.</P>
<P>SALV. And is this the $um of his method? And doth he by
this demon$tration prove the time of the fall to be above $ix
dayes?</P>
<P>SAGR. Me thinks that he hath behaved him$elf too mode$tly,
for that having it in the power of his will to give what velocity he
plea$ed to $uch a de$cending body, and might a$well have made it
$ix moneths, nay, $ix years in falling to the Earth, he is content
with $ix dayes. But, good <I>Salviatus,</I> $harpen my appetite a lit-
tle, by telling me in what manner you made your computation, in
regard you $ay, that you have heretofore ca$t it up: for I am con-
fident that if the que$tion had not required $ome ingenuity in
working it, you would never have applied your minde unto
it.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>197</p>
<P>SALV. It is not enough, <I>Sagredus,</I> that the $ubjects be noble
and great, but the bu$ine$$e con$i$ts in handling it nobly. And
who knoweth not, that in the di$$ection of the members of
a bea$t, there may be di$covered infinite wonders of provident
and prudent Nature; and yet for one, that the Anatomi$t di$-
$ects, the butcher cuts up a thou$and. Thus I, who am now
$eeking how to $atisfie your demand, cannot tell with which of the
two $hapes I had be$t to appear on the Stage; but yet, taking
heart from the example of <I>Simplicius,</I> his Authour, I will, with-
out more delays, give you an account (if I have not forgot) how
I proceeded. But before I go any further, I mu$t not omit to tell
you, that I much fear that <I>Simplicius</I> hath not faithfully related
the manner how this his Authour found, that the Cannon bul-
let in coming from the concave of the Moon to the centre of the
Earth, would $pend more than fix dayes: for if he had $uppo-
$ed that its velocity in de$cending was equal to that of the
concave (as <I>Simplicius</I> $aith he doth $uppo$e) he would have
$hewn him$elf ignorant of the fir$t, and more $imple principles
of <I>Geometry</I>; yea, I admire that <I>Simplicius,</I> in admitting the
$uppo$ition which he $peaketh of, doth not $ee the mon$trous ab-
$urdity that is couched in it.</P>
<P>SIMP. Its po$$ible that I may have erred in relating it; but
that I $ee any fallacy in it, I am $ure is not true.</P>
<P>SALV. Perhaps I did not rightly apprehend that which you
$aid, Do you not $ay, that this Authour maketh the velocity
of the bullet in de$cending equall to that which it had in tur-
ning round, being in the concave of the Moon, and that com-
ming down with the $ame velocity, it would reach to the centre
in $ix dayes?</P>
<P>SIMP. So, as I think, he writeth.</P>
<P>SALV. And do not you perceive a $hamefull errour therein?
But que$tionle$$e you di$$emble it: For it cannot be, but that
you $hould know that the $emidiameter of the Circle is le$$e than
<marg><I>A $hamefull
errour in the Ar-
gument taken from
the bullets falling
out of the Moons
concave.</I></marg>
the $ixth part of the circumference; and that con$equently, the
time in which the moveable $hall pa$$e the $emidiameter, $hall be
le$$e than the $ixth part of the time; in which, being moved
with the $ame velocity, it would pa$$e the circumference; and
that therefore the bullet de$cending with the velocity, where-
with it moved in the concave, will arrive in le$$e than four hours
at the centre, $uppo$ing that in the concave one revolution
$hould be con$ummate in twenty four hours, as he mu$t of ne-
ce$$ity have $uppo$ed it, for to keep it all the way in the $ame
vertical line.</P>
<P>SIMP. Now I thorowly perceive the mi$take: but yet I
would not lay it upon him unde$ervedly, for it's po$$ible that I
<foot>may</foot>
<p n=>198</p>
may have erred in rehear$ing his Argument, and to avoid running
into the $ame mi$takes for the future, I could wi$h I had his
Book; and if you had any body to $end for it, I would take it
for a great favour.</P>
<P>SAGR. You $hall not want a Lacquey that will runne for it
with all $peed: and he $hall do it pre$ently, without lo$ing any
time; in the mean time <I>Salviatus</I> may plea$e to oblige us with his
computation.</P>
<P>SIMP. If he go, he $hall finde it lie open upon my Desk,
together with that of the other Author, who al$o argueth a-
gain$t <I>Copernicus.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. We will make him bring that al$o for the more cer-
tainty: and in the interim <I>Salviatus</I> $hall make his calculation: I
have di$patch't away a me$$enger.</P>
<P>SALV. Above all things it mu$t be con$idered, that the motion
of de$cending grave bodies is not uniform, but departing from
<marg><I>An exact com-
pute of the time of

re$t they go continually accelerating: An effect known and ob-
$erved by all men, unle$$e it be by the forementioned modern Au-
thour, who not $peaking of acceleration, maketh it even and u-
niforme. But this general notion is of no avail, if it be not known
according to what proportion this increa$e of velocity is made; a
conclu$ion that hath been until our times unknown to all <I>Philo$o-
phers</I>; and was fir$t found out &amp; demon$trated by the ^{*} <I>Academick,</I>

quaintance he proveth, how that the acceleration of the right mo-
tion of grave bodies, is made according to the numbers uneven

numbers; which in $hort is the $ame, as if I $hould $ay, that the
$paces pa$$ed by the moveable departing from its re$t, are unto
<marg><I>The $paces pa$t

each other in proportion double to the proportion of the times,
in which tho$e $paces are mea$ured; or we will $ay, that the
$paces pa$$ed are to each other, as the $quares of their times.</P>
<P>SAGR. This is truly admirable: and do you $ay that there is
a Mathematical demon$tration for it?</P>
<P>SALV. Yes, purely Mathematical; and not onely for this, but
for many other very admirable pa$$ions, pertaining to natural mo-

<I>Friend,</I> and I have $een and con$idered them all to my very great
content and admiration, $eeing a new compleat Doctrine to $pring
up touching a $ubject, upon which have been written hundreds of
<foot>Volumes;</foot>

Volumes; and yet not $o much as one of the infinite admirable
conclu$ions that tho$e his writings contain, hath ever been ob-
$erved, or under$tood by any one, before <I>Our Friend</I> made
them out.</P>
<P>SAGR. You make me lo$e the de$ire I had to under$tand
more in our di$putes in hand, onely that I may hear $ome of
tho$e demon$trations which you $peak of; therefore either give
them me pre$ently, or at lea$t promi$e me upon your word, to
appoint a particular conference concerning them, at which <I>Sim-
plicius</I> al$o may be pre$ent, if he $hall have a mind to hear the
pa$$ions and accidents of the primary effect in Nature.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $hall undoubtedly be much plea$ed therewith, though
indeed, as to what concerneth Natural Philo$ophy, I do not think
that it is nece$$ary to de$cend unto minute particularities, a gene-
ral knowledg of the definition of motion, and of the di$tin-
ction of natural and violent, even and accelerate, and the like,
$ufficing: For if this were not $ufficient, I do not think that <I>Ari-
$totle</I> would have omitted to have taught us what ever more was
nece$$ary.</P>
<P>SALV. It may be $o. But let us not lo$e more time about
this, which I promi$e to $pend half a day apart in, for your $atis-
faction; nay, now I remember, I did promi$e you once before to
$atisfie you herein. Returning therefore to our begun calcula-
tion of the time, wherein the grave cadent body would pa$s from
the concave of the Moon to the centre of the Earth, that we may
not proceed arbitrarily and at randon, but with a Logical method,
we will fir$t attempt to a$certain our $elves by experiments often
repeated, in how long time a ball <I>v. g.</I> of Iron de$cendeth to the
Earth from an altitude of an hundred yards.</P>
<P>SAGR. Let us therefore take a ball of $uch a determinate
weight, and let it be the $ame wherewith we intend to make the
computation of the time of de$cent from the Moon.</P>
<P>SALV. This is not material, for that a ball of one, of ten, of an
hundred, of a thou$and pounds, will all mea$ure the $ame hundred
yards in the $ame time.</P>
<P>SIMP. But this I cannot believe, nor much le$s doth <I>Ari$totle</I>
think $o, who writeth, that the velocities of de$cending grave
bodies, are in the $ame proportion to one another, as their gra-
vities.</P>
<P>SALV. If you will admit this for true, <I>Simplicius,</I> you mu$t be-

lieve al$o, that two balls of the $ame matter, being let fall in the
$ame moment, one of an hundred pounds, and another of one,
from an altitude of an hundred yards, the great one arriveth at the
ground, before the other is de$cended but one yard onely: Now
bring your fancy, if you can, to imagine, that you $ee the great
<foot>ball</foot>
<p n=>200</p>
ball got to the ground, when the little one is $till within le$s than
a yard of the top of the Tower.</P>
<P>SAGR. That this propo$ition is mo$t fal$e, I make no doubt in
the world; but yet that yours is ab$olutely true, I cannot well
a$$ure my $elf: neverthele$s, I believe it, $eeing that you $o re-
$olutely affirm it; which I am $ure you would not do, if you had
not certain experience, or $ome clear demon$tration thereof.</P>
<P>SALV. I have both: and when we $hall handle the bu$ine$s
of motions apart, I will communicate them: in the interim, that
we may have no more occa$ions of interrupting our di$cour$e, we

Iron of an hundred <I>(a)</I> pounds, the which by reiterated experi-

five $econd-minutes of an hour. And becau$e, as we have $aid,
the $paces that are mea$ured by the cadent moveable, increa$e in
double proportion; that is, according to the $quares of the times,
being that the time of one fir$t-minute is duodecuple to the time
of five $econds, if we multiply the hundred yards by the $quare of
12, that is by 144, we $hall have 14400, which $hall be the num-
ber of yards that the $ame moveable $hall pa$s in one fir$t-minute
of an hour: and following the $ame rule becau$e one hour is 60
minutes, multiplying 14400, the number of yards pa$t in one mi-
nute, by the $quare of 60, that is, by 3600, there $hall come forth
51840000, the number of yards to be pa$$ed in an hour, which
make 17280 miles. And de$iring to know the $pace that the $aid
ball would pa$s in 4 hours, let us multiply 17280 by 16, (which
is the $quare of 4) and the product will be 276480 miles: which
number is much greater than the di$tance from the Lunar concave
to the centre of the Earth, which is but 196000 miles, making the
di$tance of the concave 56 $emidiameters of the Earth, as that mo-

by experience, and not upon the fingers ends) that it $hall be pa$-

exact, it $hall be pa$$ed by the moveable in 3 hours, 22 <I>min. prim.</I>
and 4 $econds.</P>
<P>SAGR. I be$eech you, dear Sir, do not defraud me of this ex-
act calculation, for it mu$t needs be very excellent.</P>
<P>SALV. So indeed it is: therefore having (as I have $aid) by
diligent tryal ob$erved, that $uch a moveable pa$$eth in its de$cent,
the height of 100 yards in 5 $econds of an hour, we will $ay, if
100 yards are pa$$ed in 5 $econds; in how many $econds $hall
<foot>588000000</foot>
<p n=>201</p>
588000000 yards (for $o many are in 56 diameters of the Earth)
be pa$$ed? The rule for this work is, that the third number mu$t
be multiplied by the $quare of the $econd, of which doth come
14700000000, which ought to be divided by the fir$t, that is, by
100, and the root $quare of the quotient, that is, 12124 is the
number $ought, namely 12124 <I>min. $ecun.</I> of an hour, which are
3 hours, 22 <I>min. prim.</I> and 4 $econds.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have $een the working, but I know nothing of the
rea$on for $o working, nor do I now think it a time to ask it.</P>
<P>SALV. Yet I will give it, though you do not ask it, becau$e it
is very ea$ie. Let us mark the$e three numbers with the Letters
A fir$t, B $econd, C
<fig>
third. A and C are the
numbers of the $paces,
B is the number of the
time; the fourth number
is $ought, of the time
al$o. And becau$e we
know, that look what
proportion the $pace A,
hath to the $puace C, the
$ame proportion $hall the
$quare of the time B
have to the $qare of the
time, which is $ought.
Therefore by the Golden Rule, let the number C be multi-
plied by the $quare of the number B, and let the product be di-
vided by the number A, and the quotient $hall be the $quare of
the number $ought, and its $quare root $hall be the number it $elf
that is $ought. Now you $ee how ea$ie it is to be under$tood.</P>
<P>SAGR. So are all truths, when once they are found out, but the
difficulty lyeth in finding them. I very well apprehend it, and kindly
thank you. And if there remain any other curio$ity touching this
point, I pray you let us hear it; for if I may $peak my mind, I
will with the favour of <I>Simplicius,</I> that from your di$cour$es I al-
wayes learn $ome new motion, but from tho$e of his Philo$o-
phers, I do not remember that I have learn't any thing of mo-
ment.</P>
<P>SALV. There might be much more $aid touching the$e local
motions; but according to agreement, we will re$erve it to a par-
ticular conference, and for the pre$ent I will $peak $omething
touching the Author named by <I>Simplicius,</I> who thinketh he hath
given a great advantage to the adver$e party in granting that, that
Canon bullet in falling from the concave of the Moon may de-
$cend with a velocity equal to the velocity wherewith it would
<foot>Cc turn</foot>
<p n=>202</p>
turn round, $taying there above, and moving along with the di-
urnal conver$ion. Now I tell him, that that $ame ball falling from
the concave unto the centre, will acquire a degree of velocity
much more than double the velocity of the diurnal motion of the
Lunar concave; and this I will make out by $olid and not imper-
<marg><I>The falling move-
able if it move with
a degree of veloci-
ty acquired in a
like time with an
uniform motion, it
$hall pa&szlig; a $pace
double to that pa$-
$ed with the acce-
leratedmotion.</I></marg>
tinent $uppo$itions. You mu$t know therefore that the grave
body falling and acquiring all the way new velocity according
to the proportion already mentioned, hath in any what$oever
place of the line of its motion $uch a degree of velocity, that if it
$hould continue to move therewith, uniformly without farther
encrea$ing it; in another time like to that of its de$cent, it would
pa$$e a $pace double to that pa$$ed in the line of the precedent
motion of de$cent. And thus for example, if that ball in coming
from the concave of the Moon to its centre hath $pent three hours,
22 min. <I>prim.</I> and 4 $econds, I $ay, that being arrived at the cen-
tre, it $hall find it $elf con$tituted in $uch a degree of velocity, that
if with that, without farther encrea$ing it, it $hould continue to
move uniformly, it would in other 3 hours, 22 min. <I>prim.</I> and
4 $econds, pa$$e double that $pace, namely as much as the whole
diameter of the Lunar Orb; and becau$e from the Moons con-
cave to the centre are 196000 miles, which the ball pa$$eth in 3
hours 22 <I>prim.</I> min. and 4 $econds, therefore (according to what
hath been $aid) the ball continuing to move with the velocity

pa$$e in other 3 hours 22 min. prim. and 4 $econds, a $pace dou-
ble to that, namely 392000 miles; but the $ame continuing in
the concave of the Moon, which is in circuit 1232000 miles, and
moving therewith in a diurnal motion, it would make in the $ame
time, that is in 3 hours 22 min. prim. and 4 $econds, 172880
miles, which are fewer by many than the half of the 392000
miles. You $ee then that the motion in the concave is not as the
modern Author $aith, that is, of a velocity impo$$ible for the fall-
ing ball to partake of, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. The di$cour$e would pa$s for current, and would give
me full $atisfaction, if that particular was but $alved, of the mo-
ving of the moveable by a double $pace to that pa$$ed in falling
in another time equal to that of the de$cent, in ca$e it doth continue
to move uniformly with the greate$t degree of velocity acquired
in de$cending. A propo$ition which you al$o once before $uppo-
$ed as true, but never demon$trated.</P>
<P>SALV. This is one of the demon$trations of <I>Our Friend,</I> and
you $hall $ee it in due time; but for the pre$ent, I will with $ome
conjectures (not teach you any thing that is new, but) remember you
of a certain contrary opinion, and $hew you, that it may haply $o be.

<P>SAGR. I have ob$erved it very well, and find (e$pecially if the
plummet be of any con$iderable weight) that it ri$eth $o little le$s
than it de$cended, $o that I have $ometimes thought, that the a-
$cending arch is equal to that de$cending, and thereupon made it
a que$tion whether the vibrations might not perpetuate them$elves;

the impediment of the Air, which re$i$ting penetration, doth $ome
$mall matter retard and impede the motion of the <I>pendulum,</I>
though indeed that impediment is but $mall: in favour of which
opinion the great number of vibrations that are made before the
moveable wholly cea$eth to move, $eems to plead.</P>
<P>SALV. The motion would not be perpetual, <I>Sagredus,</I> al-
though the impediment of the Air were totally removed, becau$e
there is another much more ab$tru$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. And what is that? as for my part I can think of no
other?</P>
<P>SALV. You will be plea$ed when you hear it, but I $hall not
tell it you till anon: in the mean time, let us proceed. I have
propo$ed the ob$ervation of this <I>Pendulum,</I> to the intent, that you
$hould under$tand, that the <I>impetus</I> acquired in the de$cending
arch, where the motion is natural, is of it $elf able to drive the
$aid ball with a violent motion, as far on the other $ide in the like
a$cending arch; if $o, I $ay, of it $elf, all external impediments
being removed: I believe al$o that every one takes it for granted,
that as in the de$cending arch the velocity all the way increa$eth,
till it come to the lowe$t point, or its perpendicularity; $o from
this point, by the other a$cending arch, it all the wav dimini$heth,
untill it come to its extreme and highe$t point: and dimini$hing
with the $ame proportions, where with it did before increa$e, $o that
the dgrees of the velocities in the points equidi$tant from the point
of perpendicularity, are equal to each other. Hence it $eemeth
to me (arguing with all due mode$ty) that I might ea$ily be induced
to believe, that if the Terre$trial Globe were bored thorow the
<marg><I>If the Terre$trial

centre, a Canon bullet de$cending through that Well, would ac-
quire by that time it came to the centre, $uch an impul$e of velo-
city, that, it having pa$$ed beyond the centre, would $pring it up-
wards the other way, as great a $pace, as that was wherewith it had
de$cended, all the way beyond the centre dimini$hing the velocity
with decrea$ements like to the increa$ements acquired in the de-
$cent: and the time $pent in this $econd motion of a$cent, I be-
lieve, would be equal to the time of de$cent. Now if the move-
able by dimini$hing that its greate$t degree of velocity which it
<foot>Cc 2 had</foot>
<p n=>204</p>
had in the centre, $ucce$$ively until it come to total extinction,
do carry the moveable in $uch a time $uch a certain $pace, as it had
gone in $uch a like quantity of time, by the acqui$t of velocity
from the total privation of it until it came to that its greate$t degree;
it $eemeth very rea$onable, that if it $hould move always with the
$aid greate$t degree of velocity it would pa$s, in $uch another
quantity of time, both tho$e $paces: For if we do but in our
mind $ucce$$ively divide tho$e velocities into ri$ing and falling
degrees, as <I>v. g.</I> the$e numbers in the margine; $o that the
fir$t $ort unto 10 be $uppo$ed the increa$ing velocities, and the
others unto 1, be the decrea$ing; and let tho$e of the time
of the de$cent, and the others of the time of the a$cent being
added all together, make as many, as if one of the two $ums of
them had been all of the greate$t degrees, and therefore the
whole $pace pa$$ed by all the degrees of the increa$ing veloci-
ties, and decrea$ing, (which put together is the whole diame-
ter) ought to be equal to the $pace pa$$ed by the greate$t velo-
cities, that are in number half the aggregate of the increa$ing
and decrea$ing velocities. I know that I have but ob$curely
expre$$ed my $elf, and I wi$h I may be under$tood.</P>
<P>SAGR. I think I under$tand you very well; and al$o that I
can in a few words $hew, that I do under$tand you. You had
a mind to $ay, that the motion begining from re$t, and all the
way increa$ing the velocity with equal augmentations, $uch as
are tho$e of continuate numbers begining at 1, rather at 0,
which repre$enteth the $tate of re$t, di$po$ed as in the margine:
and continued at plea$ure, $o as that the lea$t degree may be 0,
and the greate$t <I>v. g.</I> 5, all the$e degrees of velocity wherewith
the moveable is moved, make the $um of 15; but if the
moveable $hould move with as many degrees in number as
the$e are, and each of them equal to the bigge$t, which is 5, the
aggregate of all the$e la$t velocities would be double to the
others, namely 30. And therefore the moveable moving with
a like time, but with uniform velocity, which is that of the
highe$t degree 5, ought to pa$s a $pace double to that which it
pa$$eth in the accelerate time, which beginneth at the $tate of re$t.</P>
<P>SALV. According to your quick and piercing way of appre-
hending things, you have explained the whole bu$ine$s with more
plainne$s than I my $elf; and put me al$o in mind of adding $ome-
thing more: for in the accelerate motion, the augmentation be-
ing continual, you cannot divide the degrees of velocity, which
continually increa$e, into any determinate number, becau$e chan-
ging every moment, they are evermore infinite. Therefore we
$hall be the better able to exemplifie our intentions by de$cribing
a Triangle, which let be this A B C, [<I>in Fig.</I> 8.] taking in the
<foot>$ide</foot>
<p n=>205</p>
$ide A C, as many equal parts as we plea$e, A D, D E, E F, F G,
and drawing by the points D, E, F, G, right lines parallel to the ba$e
B C. Now let us imagine the parts marked in the line A C, to be
equal times, and let the parallels drawn by the points D, E, F, G,
repre$ent unto us the degrees of velocity accelerated, and increa$-
ing equally in equal times; and let the point A be the $tate of re$t,
from which the moveable departing, hath <I>v. g.</I> in the time A D,
acquired the degree of velocity D H, in the $econd time we will
$uppo$e, that it hath increa$ed the velocity from D H, as far as to
E I, and $o $uppo$ing it to have grown greater in the $ucceeding
times, according to the increa$e of the lines F K, G L, <I>&amp;c.</I> but
<marg><I>The acceleration
of grave bodies na-
turally de$cendent,
increa$eth from
moment to moment.</I></marg>
becau$e the acceleration is made continually from moment to mo-
ment, and not disjunctly from one certain part of time to another;
the point A being put for the lowe$t moment of velocity, that is,
for the $tate of re$t, and A D for the fir$t in$tant of time follow-
ing; it is manife$t, that before the acqui$t of the degree of velocity
D H, made in the time A D, the moveable mu$t have pa$t by
infinite other le$$er and le$$er degrees gained in the infinite in$tants
that are in the time D A, an$wering the infinite points that are in
the line D A; therefore to repre$ent unto us the infinite degrees
of velocity that precede the degree D H, it is nece$$ary to imagine
infinite lines $ucce$$ively le$$er and le$$er, which are $uppo$ed to
be drawn by the infinite points of the line D A, and parallels to
D H, the which infinite lines repre$ent unto us the $uperficies of
the Triangle A H D, and thus we may imagine any $pace pa$$ed
by the moveable, with a motion which begining at re$t, goeth uni-
formly accelerating, to have $pent and made u$e of infinite degrees
of velocity, increa$ing according to the infinite lines that begin-
ing from the point A, are $uppo$ed to be drawn parallel to the
line H D, and to the re$t I E, K F, L G, the motion continuing as
far as one will.</P>
<P>Now let us compleat the whole Parallelogram A M B C, and let
us prolong as far as to the $ide thereof B M, not onely the Parallels
marked in the Triangle, but tho$e infinite others imagined to be
drawn from all the points of the $ide A C; and like as B C, was
the greate$t of tho$e infinite parallels of the Triangle, repre$ent-
ing unto us the greate$t degree of velocity acquired by the move-
able in the accelerate motion, and the whole $uperficies of the $aid
Triangle, was the ma$s and $um of the whole velocity, wherewith
in the time A C it pa$$ed $uch a certain $pace, $o the parallelogram
is now a ma$s and aggregate of a like number of degrees of ve-
locity, but each equal to the greate$t B C, the which ma$s of ve-
locities will be double to the ma$s of the increa$ing velocities in
the Triangle, like as the $aid Parallelogram is double to the Tri-
angle: and therefore if the moveable, that falling did make u$e
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>206</p>
of the accelerated degrees of velocity, an$wering to the triangle
A B C, hath pa$$ed in $uch a time $uch a $pace, it is very rea$onable
and probable, that making u$e of the uniform velocities an$wering
to the parallelogram, it $hall pa$$e with an even motion in the
$ame time a $pace double to that pa$$ed by the accelerate mo-
tion.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am entirely $atisfied. And if you call this a probable
Di$cour$e, what $hall the nece$$ary demon$trations be? I wi$h

Theme, nor do you fail, I pray you <I>Salviatus,</I> to tell me that
which you hinted to me to be the cau$e of the <I>Pendulum's</I> qui-

<P>SALV. Tell me; of two <I>penduli</I> hanging at unequal di$tan-

<P>SALV. This greater or le$$e elongation importeth nothing at
all, for the $ame <I>pendulum</I> alwayes maketh its reciprocations in e-
quall times, be they longer or $horter, that is, though the <I>pendulum</I>
<marg><I>The vibrations
of the $ame</I> pen-

be little or much removed from its perpendicularity, and if they
are not ab$olutely equal, they are in$en$ibly different, as expe-
rience may $hew you: and though they were very unequal, yet
would they not di$countenance, but favour our cau$e. There-
fore let us draw the perpendicular A B [<I>in Fig.</I> 9.] and hang from
the point A, upon the threed A C, a plummet C, and another up-
on the $ame threed al$o, which let be E, and the threed A C, being
removed from its perpendicularity, and then letting go the plum-
mets C and E, they $hall move by the arches C B D, E G F, and
the plummet E, as hanging at a le$$er di$tance, and withall, as
(by what you $aid) le$$e removed, will return back again fa$ter,
and make its vibrations more frequent than the plummet C, and
therefore $hall hinder the $aid plummet C, from running $o much
farther towards the term D, as it would do, if it were free: and
thus the plummet E bringing unto it in every vibration continuall
<marg><I>The cau$e which

impediment, it $hall finally reduce it to quie$cence. Now the
$ame threed, (taking away the middle plummet) is a compo$ition
of many grave <I>penduli,</I> that is, each of its parts is $uch a <I>pendu-
lum</I> fa$tned neerer and neerer to the point A, and therefore di$po-
<foot>$ed</foot>
<p n=>207</p>
$ed to make its vibrations $ucce$$ively more and more frequent;
and con$equently is able to bring a continual impediment to the
plummet C; and for a proof that this is $o, if we do but ob$erve
the thread A C, we $hall $ee it di$tended not directly, but in an
arch; and if in$tead of the thread we take a chain, we $hall di$-
cern the effect more per$ectly; and e$pecially removing the gra-

vity C, to a con$iderable di$tance from the perpendicular A B, for
that the chain being compo$ed of many loo$e particles, and each of
them of $ome weight, the arches A E C, and A F D, will appear
notably incurvated. By rea$on therefore, that the parts of the
chain, according as they are neerer to the point A, de$ire to make
their vibrations more frequent, they permit not the lower parts of
the $aid chain to $wing $o far as naturally they would: and by
continual detracting from the vibrations of the plummet C, they
finally make it cea$e to move, although the impediment of the air
might be removed.</P>

we may grant much to our adver$aries) $ix dayes; in which time
they $hall be turned $ix times about the Earth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SALV. You have but too faithfully cited the argument of this
per$on. From hence you may collect <I>Simplicius,</I> with what cau-
tion they ought to proceed, who would give them$elves up to be-
lieve others in tho$e things, which perhaps they do not believe
them$elves. For me thinks it a thing impo$$ible, but that this Au-
thor was advi$ed, that he did de$ign to him$elf a circle, who$e dia-
meter (which among$t Mathematicians, is le$$e than one third part
of the circumference) is above 72 times bigger than it $elf: an
errour that affirmeth that to be con$iderably more than 200,
which is le$$e than one.</P>
<P>SAGR. It may be, that the$e Mathematical proportions, which
are true in ab$tract, being once applied in concrete to Phy$ical and
Elementary circles, do not $o exactly agree: And yet, I think,
that the Cooper, to find the $emidiameter of the bottom, which he
is to fit to the Cask, doth make u$e of the rule of Mathematicians
in ab$tract, although $uch bottomes be things meerly material,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>209</p>
and concrete: therefore let <I>Simplicius</I> plead in excu$e of this
Author; and whether he chinks that the Phy$icks can differ $o
very much from the Mathematicks.</P>
<P>SIMP. The $ub$tractions are in my opinion in$ufficient to $alve
this difference, which is $o extreamly too great to be reconciled:
and in this ca$e I have no more to $ay but that, <I>Quandoque bonus
dormitet Homerus.</I> But $uppo$ing the calculation of ^{*} <I>Salviatus</I>
<marg>* Not <I>Sagre-
dus,</I> as the Latine
ha hit.</marg>
to be more exact, and that the time of the de$cent of the ball
were no more than three hours; yet me thinks, that coming from
the concave of the Moon, which is $o great a di$tance off, it would
be an admirable thing, that it $hould have an in$tinct of maintain-
ing it $elf all the way over the $elf-$ame point of the Earth, over
which it did hang in its departure thence and not rather be left a
very great way behind.</P>
<P>SALV. The effect may be admirable, and not admirable, but
natural and ordinary, according as the things precedent may fall
out. For if the ball (according to the Authors $uppo$itions)
whil$t it $taid in the concave of the Moon, had the circular motion
of twenty four hours together with the Earth, and with the re$t of
the things contained within the $aid Concave; that very vertue
which made it turn round before its de$cent, will continue it in
the $ame motion in its de$cending. And $o far it is from not keep-
ing pace with the motion of the Earth, and from $taying behind,
that it is more likely to out-go it; being that in its approaches to
the Earth, the motion of gyration is to be made with circles con-
tinually le$$er and le$$er; $o that the ball retaining in it $elf that
$elf-$ame velocity which it had in the concave, it ought to antici-
pate, as I have $aid, the <I>vertigo</I> or conver$ion of the Earth. But
if the ball in the concave did want that circulation, it is not obli-
ged in de$cending to maintain it $elf perpendicularly over that
point of the Earth, which was ju$t under it when the de$cent be-
gan. Nor will <I>Copernicus,</I> or any of his followers affirm the
$ame.</P>
<P>SIMP. But the Author maketh an objection, as you $ee, de-
manding on what principle this circular motion of grave and light
bodies, doth depend: that is, whether upon an internal or an ex-
ternal principle.</P>
<P>SALV. Keeping to the Probleme of which we $peak, I $ay,
that that very principle which made the ball turn round, whil'$t it
was in the Lunar concave, is the $ame that maintaineth al$o the
circulation in the de$cent: yet I leave the Author at liberty to
make it internal or external at his plea$ure.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Author proveth, that it can neither be inward nor
outward.</P>
<P>SALV. And I will $ay then, that the ball in the concave did
<foot>Dd not</foot>
<p n=>210</p>
not move, and $o he $hall not be bound to $hew how that in de$-
cending it continueth all the way vertically over one point, for
that it will not do any $uch thing.</P>
<P>SIMP. Very well; But if grave bodies, and light can have no
principle, either internal or external of moving circularly, than
neither can the terre$trial Globe move with a circular motion: and
thus you have the intent of the Author.</P>
<P>SALV. I did not $ay, that the Earth had no principle, either
interne, or externe to the motion of gyration, but I $ay, that I do
not know which of the two it hath; and yet my not knowing it
hath not a power to deprive it of the $ame; but if this Author
can tell by what principle other mundane bodies are moved round,
of who$e motion there is no doubt; I $ay, that that which ma-
keth the Earth to move, is a vertue, like to that, by which <I>Mars</I>
and <I>Jupiter</I> are moved, and wherewith he believes that the $tarry
Sphere it $elf al$o doth move; and if he will but a$$ure me, who is
the mover of one of the$e moveables, I will undertake to be able
to tell him who maketh the Earth to move. Nay more; I will
undertake to do the $ame, if he can but tell me, who moveth the
parts of the Earth downwards.</P>
<P>SIMP. The cau$e of this is mo$t manife$t, and every one knows
that it is gravity.</P>
<P>SALV. You are out, <I>Simplicius,</I> you $hould $ay, that every

cular motion, in more general termes, we a$$ign the <I>Vertue impre$-
$ed,</I> and call the $ame an <I>Intelligence,</I> either a$$i$ting, or informing;
and to infinite other motions we a$cribe Nature for their cau$e.</P>
<P>SIMP. It is my opinion, that this Author asketh far le$$e than
that, to which you deny to make an$wer; for he doth not ask
what is nominally and particularly the principle that moveth
grave and light bodies circularly, but what$oever it be, he de$i-
reth to know, whether you think it intrin$ecal, or extrin$ecal:
For howbeit, <I>v. gr.</I> I do not know, what kind of thing that gravity
is, by which the Earth de$cendeth; yet I know that it is an intern
<foot>princi-</foot>
<p n=>211</p>
principle, $eeing that if it be not hindered, it moveth $pontane-
ou$ly: and on the contrary, I know that the principle which mo-
veth it upwards, is external, although that I do not know, what
thing that vertue is, impre$$ed on it by the projicient.</P>
<P>SALV. Into how many que$tions mu$t we excurre, if we would
decide all the difficulties, which $ucce$$ively have dependance one
upon another! You call that an external (and you al$o call it a
preternatural and violent) principle, which moveth the grave pro-
ject upwards; but its po$$ible that it may be no le$$e interne and
natural, than that which moveth it downwards; it may peradven-
<marg><I>The vertue which
carrieth grave pro-
jects upwards, is
no le$$e natural to
them, than the
gravity which mo-
veth them down-
wards.</I></marg>
ture be called external and violent, $o long as the moveable is joy-
ned to the projicient; but being $eparated, what external thing
remaineth for a mover of the arrow, or ball? In $umme, it mu$t
nece$$arliy be granted, that that vertue which carrieth $uch a move-
able upwards, is no le$$e interne, than that which moveth it down-
wards; and I think the motion of grave bodies a$cending by the
<I>impetus</I> conceived, to be altogether as natural, as the motion of
de$cent depending on gravity.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will never grant this; for the motion of de$cent hath
its principle internal, natural, and perpetual, and the motion of
a$cent hath its principle externe, violent, and finite.</P>
<P>SALV. If you refu$e to grant me, that the principles of the
motions of grave bodies downwards and upwards, are equally in-
<marg><I>Contrary prin-
ciples cannot natu-
rally re$ide in the
$ame $ubject.</I></marg>
ternal and natural; what would you do, if I $hould $ay, that they
may al$o be the $ame in number?</P>
<P>SIMP. I leave it to you to judge.</P>
<P>SALV. But I de$ire you your $elf to be the Judge: Therefore
tell me, Do you believe that in the $ame natural body, there may
re$ide interne principles, that are contrary to one another?</P>
<P>SIMP. I do verily believe there cannot.</P>
<P>SALV. What do you think to be the natural inclination of
Earth, of Lead, of Gold, and in $um, of the mo$t ponderous mat-
ters; that is, to what motion do you believe that their interne
principle draweth them?</P>
<P>SIMP. To that towards the centre of things grave, that is, to
the centre of the Univer$e, and of the Earth, whither, if they be
not hindered, it will carry them.</P>
<P>SALV. So that, if the Terre$trial Globe were bored thorow,
and a Well made that $hould pa$$e through the centre of it, a
Cannon bullet being let fall into the $ame, as being moved by a
natural and intrin$ick principle, would pa$$e to the centre; and it
would make all this motion $pontaneou$ly, and by intrin$ick prin-
ciple, is it not $o?</P>
<P>SIMP. So I verily believe.</P>
<P>SALV. But when it is arrived at the centre, do you think that
<foot>Dd 2 it</foot>
<p n=>212</p>
it will pa$$e any further, or el$e that there it would immediately
$tand $till, and move no further?</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that it would continue to move a great way
further.</P>
<P>SALV. But this motion beyond the centre, would it not be up-
wards, and according to your a$$ertion preternatural, and violent?
And yet on what other principle do you make it to depend, but
only upon the $elf $ame, which did carry the ball to the centre,
and which you called intrin$ecal, and natural? Finde, if you can,
another external projicient, that overtaketh it again to drive it
upwards. And this that hath been $aid of the motion thorow
the centre, is al$o $een by us here above; for the interne <I>impetus</I>
<marg><I>The natural mo-
tion changeth it
$elfe into that
which is called pre-
ternatural and vi-
olent.</I></marg>
of a grave body falling along a declining $uperficies, if the $aid
$uperficies be reflected the other way, it $hall carry it, without a
jot interrupting the motion, al$o upwards. A ball of lead that
hangeth by a thread, being removed from its perpendicularity, de-
$cendeth $pontaneou$ly, as being drawn by its internal inclination,
and without any interpo$ure of re$t, pa$$eth beyond the lowe$t
point of perpendicularity: and without any additional mover,
moveth upwards. I know that you will not deny, but that the
principle of grave bodies that moveth them downwards, is no le$s
natural, and intrin$ecal, than that principle of light bodies, which
moveth them upwards: $o that I propo$e to your con$ideration a
ball of lead, which de$cending through the Air from a great al-
titude, and $o moving by an intern principle, and comming to a
depth of water, continueth its de$cent, and without any other ex-
terne mover, $ubmergeth a great way; and yet the motion of
de$cent in the water is preternatural unto it; but yet neverthele$s
dependeth on a principle that is internal, and not external to the
ball. You $ee it demon$trated then, that a moveable may be
moved by one and the $ame internal principle, with contrary mo-
tions.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe there are $olutions to all the$e objections,
though for the pre$ent I do not remember them; but however it
be, the Author continueth to demand, on what principle this cir-
cular motion of grave and light bodies dependeth; that is, whe-
ther on a principle internal, or external; and proceeding for-
wards, $heweth, that it can be neither on the one, nor on the other,
$aying; <I>Si ab externo; Deu$ne illum excitat per continuum mira-
culum? an ver&ograve; Angelus, an a&euml;r? Et hunc quidem multi a$$ig-
nant. Sed contra---- [In Engli$h thus]</I> If from an externe prin-
ciple; Whether God doth not excite it by a continued Miracle?
or an Angel, or the Air? And indeed many do a$$ign this. But
on the contrary-----.</P>
<P>SALV. Trouble not your $elf to read his argument; for I am
<foot>none</foot>
<p n=>213</p>
none of tho$e who a$cribe that principle to the ambient air. As
to the Miracle, or an Angel, I $hould rather incline to this $ide; for
that which taketh beginning from a Divine Miracle, or from an
Angelical operation; as for in$tance, the tran$portation of a Can-
non ball or bullet into the concave of the Moon, doth in all pro-
bability depend on the vertue of the $ame principle for perform-
ing the re$t. But, as to the Air, it $erveth my turn, that it doth
not hinder the circular motion of the moveables, which we did
$uppo$e to move thorow it. And to prove that, it $ufficeth (nor is
more required) that it moveth with the $ame motion, and fini$h-
eth its circulations with the $ame velocity, that the Terre$trial
Globe doth.</P>
<P>SIMP. And he likewi$e makes his oppo$ition to this al$o;
demanding who carrieth the air about, Nature, or Violence?
And proveth, that it cannot be Nature, alledging that that is con-
trary to truth, experience, and to <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf.</P>
<P>SALV. It is not contrary to <I>Copernicus</I> in the lea$t, who writeth
no $uch thing; and this Author a$cribes the$e things to him with
two exce$$ive courte$ie. It's true, he $aith, and for my part I
think he $aith well, that the part of the air neer to the Earth, be-
ing rather a terre$trial evaporation, may have the $ame nature,
and naturally follow its motion; or, as being contiguous to it,
may follow it in the $ame manner, as the Peripateticks $ay, that
the $uperiour part of it, and the Element of fire, follow the mo-
tion of the Lunar Concave, $o that it lyeth upon them to declare,
whether that motion be natural, or violent.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Author will reply, that if <I>Copernicus</I> maketh only
the inferiour part of the Air to move, and $uppo$eth the upper
part thereof to want the $aid motion, he cannot give a rea$on, how
that quiet air can be able to carry tho$e grave bodies along with
it, and make them keep pace with the motion of the Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Copernicus</I> will $ay, that this natural propen$ion of the
<marg><I>The propen$ion
of elementary bo-
dies to follow the
Earth, hath a li-
mited Sphere of
activity.</I></marg>
elementary bodies to $ollow the motion of the Earth, hath a li-
mited Sphere, out of which $uch a natural inclination would cea$e;
be$ides that, as I have $aid, the Air is not that which carrieth the
moveables along with it; which being $eparated from the Earth,
do follow its motion; $o that all the objections come to nothing,
which this Author produceth to prove, that the Air cannot cau$e
$uch effects.</P>
<P>SIMP. To $hew therefore, that that cannot be, it will be nece$-
$ary to $ay, that $uch like effects depend on an interne principle,
again$t which po$ition, <I>oboriuntur difficillim&aelig;, imm&ograve; inextricabiles
qu&aelig;$tiones $ecund&aelig;,</I> of which $ort are the$e that follow. <I>Princi-
pium illud internum vel e$t accidens, vel $ub$tantia. Si primum;
quale nam illud? nam qualitas locomotiva circum, hactenus nulla</I>
<foot><I>vide-</I></foot>
<p n=>214</p>
<I>videtur agnita. (In Engli$h thus:)</I> Contrary to which po$ition
there do ari$e mo$t difficult, yea inextricable $econd que$tions,
$uch as the$e; That intern principle is either an accident, or a
$ub$tance. If the fir$t; what manner of accident is it? For a
locomotive quality about the centre, $eemeth to be hitherto ac-
knowledged by none.</P>
<P>SALV. How, is there no $uch thing acknowledged? Is it not
known to us, that all the$e elementary matters move round, to-
gether with the Earth? You $ee how this Author $uppo$eth for
true, that which is in que$tion.</P>
<P>SIMP. He $aith, that we do not $ee the $ame; and me thinks,
he hath therein rea$on on his $ide.</P>
<P>SALV. We $ee it not, becau$e we turn round together with
them.</P>
<P>SIMP. Hear his other Argument. <I>Qu&aelig; etiam $i e$$et, quo-
modo tamen inveniretur in rebus tam contrariis? in igne, ut in a-
qu&acirc;; in a&euml;re, ut in terra; in viventibus, ut in anima carentibus?
[in Engli$h thus:]</I> Which although it were, yet how could it be
found in things $o contrary? in the fire, as in the water? in the
air, as in the earth? in living creatures, as in things wanting
life?</P>
<P>SALV. Suppo$ing for this time, that water and fire are contra-
ries; as al$o the air and earth; (of which yet much may be $aid)
the mo$t that could follow from thence would be, that tho$e mo-
tions cannot be common to them, that are contrary to one ano-
ther: $o that <I>v. g.</I> the motion upwards, which naturally agreeth
to fire, cannot agree to water; but that, like as it is by nature con-
trary to fire: $o to it that motion $uiteth, which is contrary to the
motion of fire, which $hall be the motion <I>deor$&ugrave;m</I>; but the cir-
cular motion, which is not contrary either to the motion <I>$ur$&ugrave;m,</I>
or to the motion <I>deor$&ugrave;m,</I> but may mix with both, as <I>Aristotle</I>
him$elf affirmeth, why may it not equally $uit with grave bodies
and with light? The motions in the next place, which cannot be
common to things alive, and dead, are tho$e which depend on the
$oul: but tho$e which belong to the body, in as much as it is ele-
mentary, and con$equently participateth of the qualities of the e-
lements, why may not they be common as well to the dead corps,
as to the living body? And therefore, if the circular motion be
proper to the elements, it ought to be common to the mixt bodies
al$o.</P>
<P>SAGR. It mu$t needs be, that this Author holdeth, that a dead
cat, falling from a window, it is not po$$ible that a live cat al$o
could fall; it not being a thing convenient, that a carca$e $hould
partake of the qualities which $uit with things alive.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore the di$cour$e of this Author concludeth
<foot>nothing</foot>
<p n=>215</p>
nothing again$t one that $hould affirm, that the principle of the cir-
cular motions of grave and light bodies is an intern accident: I
know not how he may prove, that it cannot be a $ub$tance.</P>
<P>SIMP. He brings many Arguments again$t this. The fir$t of
which is in the$e words: <I>Si $ecundum (nemp&egrave;, $i dieas tale princi-
pium e$$e $ub$tantiam) illud e$t aut materia, aut forma, aut compo-
$itum. Sed repugnant iterum tot diver$&aelig; rerum natur&aelig;, quales
$unt aves, limaces, $axa, $agitt&aelig;, nives, fumi, grandines, pi$ces,
&amp;c. qu&aelig; tamen omnia $pecie &amp; genere differentia, moverentur &agrave;
natur&acirc; $u&acirc; circulariter, ip$a naturis diver$i$$ima, &amp;c. [In Engli$h
thus]</I> If the $econd, (that is, if you $hall $ay that this principle is
a $ub$tance) it is either matter, or form, or a compound of both.
But $uch diver$e natures of things are again repugnant, $uch as are
birds, $nails, $tones, darts, $nows, $moaks, hails, fi$hes, &amp;c. all
which notwith$tanding their differences in $pecies and kind, are
moved of their own nature circularly, they being of their natures
mo$t different, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SALV. If the$e things before named are of diver$e natures, and
things of diver$e natures cannot have a motion in common, it mu$t
follow, if you would give $atisfaction to all, that you are to think
of, more than two motions onely of upwards and downwards: and
if there mu$t be one for the arrows, another for the $nails, another
for the $tones, and another for fi$hes; then are you to bethink your
$elf of worms, topazes and mu$hrums, which are not le$s different
in nature from one another, than $now and hail.</P>
<P>SIMP. It $eems that you make a je$t of the$e Arguments.</P>
<P>SALV. No indeed, <I>Simplicius,</I> but it hath been already an-
$wered above, to wit, that if one motion, whether downwards or
upwards, can agree with all tho$e things afore named, a circular
motion may no le$s agree with them: and as you are a <I>Peripate-
tick,</I> do not you put a greater difference between an elementary
comet and a celeftial $tar, than between a fi$h and a bird? and
yet both tho$e move circularly. Now propo$e your $econd Ar-
gument.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Si terra $taret per voluntatem Dei, rotar&eacute;ntne c&aelig;tera, an
non? $i hoc, fal$um e$t &agrave; natur&acirc; gyrare; $i illud, redeunt priores

nidulo $uo, &amp; corvus limaci, petraque, etiam volans, imminere
non po$$et. [Which I thus render</I>:] If the Earth be $uppo$ed to
$tand $till by the will of God, $hould the re$t of bodies turn round
or no? If not, then it's fal$e that they are revolved by nature; if
the other, the former que$tions will return upon us. And
truly it would be $trange that the Sea-pie $hould not be able to
hover over the $mall fi$h, the Lark over her ne$t, and the Crow o-
ver the $nail and rock, though flying.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>216</p>
<P>SALV. I would an$wer for my $elf in general terms, that if
it were appointed by the will of God, that the Earth $hould cea$e
from its diurnal revolution, tho$e birds would do what ever $hould
plea$e the $ame Divine will. But if this Author de$ire a more
particular an$wer, I $hould tell him, that they would do quite con-
trary to what they do now, if whil$t they, being $eparated from
the Earth, do bear them$elves up in the air, the Terre$trial Globe
by the will of God, $hould all on a $udden be put upon a precipi-
tate motion; it concerneth this Author now to a$certain us what
would in this ca$e $ucceed.</P>
<P>SAGR. I pray you, <I>Salviatus,</I> at my reque$t to grant to this
Author, that the Earth $tanding $till by the will of God, the other
things, $eparated from it, would continue to turn round of their
own natural motion, and let us hear what impo$$ibilities or incon-
veniences would follow: for I, as to my own particular, do not
$ee how there can be greater di$orders, than the$e produced by the
Author him$elf, that is, that Larks, though they $hould flie, could
not be able to hover over their ne$ts, nor Crows over $nails, or
rocks: from whence would follow, that Crows mu$t $uffer for
want of $nails, and young Larks mu$t die of hunger, and cold, not
being able to be fed or $heltered by the wings of the old ones.
This is all the ruine that I can conceive would follow, $uppo$ing
the Authors $peech to be true. Do you $ee, <I>Simplicius,</I> if grea-
ter inconveniences would happen?</P>
<P>SIMP. I know not how to di$cover greater; but it is very cre-
dible, that the Author be$ides the$e, di$covered other di$orders in
Nature, which perhaps in reverend re$pect of her, he was not will-
ing to in$tance in. Therefore let us proceed to the third Obje-
ction. <I>In$uper qu&icirc; fit, ut ist&aelig; res tam vari&aelig; tant&ugrave;m moveantur
ab Occa$u in Ortum, parallel&aelig; ad &AElig;quatorem? ut $emper movean-

how comes it to pa$s that the$e things, $o diver$e, are onely moved
from the We$t towards the Ea$t, parallel to the &AElig;quinoctial?
that they always move, and never re$t?</P>
<P>SALV. They move from We$t to Ea$t parallel to the &AElig;qui-
noctial without cea$ing, in the $ame manner as you believe the
fixed $tars to move from Ea$t to We$t, parallel to the &AElig;quinocti-
al, without ever re$ting.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Quar&egrave;, qu&ograve; $unt altiores, celeri&ugrave;s; qu&ograve; humiliores, tar-
di&ugrave;s? (i. e.)</I> Why are the higher the $wifter, and the lower the
$lower?</P>
<P>SALV. Becau$e that in a Sphere or circle, that turns about up-
on its own centre, the remoter parts de$cribe greater circuits, and
the parts nearer at hand de$cribe le$$er in the $ame time.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Quare, qu&aelig; &AElig;quinoctiali propriores, in majori; qu&aelig;</I>

tho$e near the &AElig;quinoctial carried about in a greater circle, and
tho$e which are remote in a le$$er?</P>
<P>SALV. To imitate the $tarry Sphere, in which tho$e neare$t
to the &AElig;quinoctial, move in greater circles, than the more re-
mote.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Quar&egrave; Pila eadem $ub &AElig;quinoctiali tota circa centrum

[That is:]</I> Why is the $ame ball under the &AElig;quinoctial wholly
turned round the centre of the Earth in the greate$t circumfe-
rence, with an incredible celerity; but under the Pole about its
own centre, in no circuite, but with the ultimate degree of tar-
dity?</P>
<P>SALV. To imitate the $tars of the Firmament, that would do
the like if they had the diurnal motion.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Quare eadem res, pila v. g. plumbea, $i $emel terram

migret $ecund&ugrave;m circulum maximum, $ed tran$lata extra &AElig;quino-
ctialem in circulis minoribus agetur? [Which $peaketh thus:]</I>
Why doth not the $ame thing, as for example, a ball of lead
turn round every where according to the $ame great circle, if once
de$cribing a great circle, it hath incompa$$ed the Earth, but being
removed from the &AElig;quinoctial, doth move in le$$er circles?</P>
<P>SALV. Becau$e $o would, nay, according to the doctrine of
<I>Ptolomey,</I> $o have $ome fixed $tars done, which once were very
near the &AElig;quinoctial, and de$cribed very va$t circles, and now that
they are farther off, de$cribe le$$er.</P>
<P>SAGR. If I could now but keep in mind all the$e fine no-
tions, I $hould think that I had made a great purcha$e; I mu$t
needs intreat you, <I>Simplicius,</I> to lend me this Book, for there can-
not chu$e but be a $ea of rare and ingenious matters contained in
it.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will pre$ent you with it.</P>
<P>SAGR. Not $o, Sir; I would not deprive you of it: but are
the Queries yet at an end?</P>
<P>SIMP. No Sir; hearken therefore. <I>Si latio circularis gra-
vibus &amp; levibus e$t naturalis, qualis e$t ea qu&aelig; fit $ecund&ugrave;m line-

a circular lation is natural to heavy and light things, what is that
which is made according to a right line? For if it be natural, how
then is that motion which is about the centre natural, $eeing it
<foot>Ee differs</foot>
<p n=>218</p>
differs in $pecies from a right motion? If it be violent, how is it
that a fiery dart flying upwards, $parkling over our heads at a di-
$tance from the Earth, but not turning about, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<marg><I>Of the mixt mo-
<*>ion we $ee not the
<*>art that is circu-
<*>ar, becau$e we
<*>artake thereof.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. It hath been $aid already very often, that the circular
motion is natural to the whole, and to its parts, whil$t they are in
perfect di$po$ure, and the right is to reduce to order the parts
di$ordered; though indeed it is better to $ay, that neither the
parts ordered or di$ordered ever move with a right motion, but
with one mixed, which might as well be averred meerly circular:
but to us but one part onely of this motion is vi$ible and ob$er-
vable, that is, the part of the right, the other part of the circular
being imperceptible to us, becau$e we partake thereof. And this
an$wers to the rays which move upwards, and round about, but we
cannot di$tingui$h their circular motion, for that, with that we our
$elves move al$o. But I believe that this Author never thought
of this mixture; for you may $ee that he re$olutely $aith, that the
rays go directly upwards, and not at all in gyration.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Quare centrum $ph&aelig;re delap$&aelig; $ub &AElig;quatore $piram de-
$cribit in ejus plano: $ub aliis parallelis $piram de$cribit in cono?
$ub Polo de$cendit in axe lineam gyralem, decurrens in $uperficie
cylindric&acirc; con$ignatam</I>? (In Engli$h to this purpo$e:) Why doth
the centre of a falling Globe under the &AElig;quinoctial de$cribe a
$piral line in the plane of the &AElig;quator; and in other parallels
a $piral about a Cone; and under the Pole de$cend in the
axis de$cribing a gyral line, running in a Cylindrical Super$i-
cies?</P>
<P>SALV. Becau$e of the lines drawn from the Centre to the cir-
cumference of the $phere, which are tho$e by which <I>graves</I> de-
fcend, that which terminates in the &AElig;quinoctial de$igneth a cir-
cle, and tho$e that terminate in other parallels de$cribe conical
$uperficies; now the axis de$cribeth nothing at all, but continueth
in its own being. And if I may give you my judgment freely, I
will $ay, that I cannot draw from all the$e Queries, any $en$e that
interfereth with the motion of the Earth; for if I demand of this
Author, (granting him that the Earth doth not move) what would
follow in all the$e particulars, $uppo$ing that it do move, as <I>Co-
pernicus</I> will have it; I am very confident, that he would $ay that
all the$e effects would happen, that he hath objected, as inconve-
niences to di$prove its mobility: $o that in this mans opinion ne-
ce$$ary con$equences are accounted ab$urdities: but I be$eech
you, if there be any more, di$patch them, and free us $peedily
from this weari$om task.</P>
<P>SIMP. In this which follows he oppo$es <I>Copernicus</I> &amp; his Sectators,
who affirm, that the motion of the parts $eparated from their whole,
is onely to unite them$elves to their whole; but that the moving
<foot>circularly</foot>
<p n=>219</p>
circularly along with the vertigenous diurnal revolution is ab$o-
lutely natural: again$t which he objecteth, $aying, that according
to the$e mens opinion; <I>Si tota terra, un&agrave; cum aqu&acirc; in nihilum

[Which I tran$late to this $en$e:] If the whole Earth, together
with the Water were reduced into nothing, no hail or rain would
fall from the clouds, but would be onely naturally carried round;
neither any fire or fiery thing would a$cend, $eeing to the$e that men
it is no improbable opinion that there is no fire above.</P>
<P>SALV. The providence of this Philo$opher is admirable, and
worthy of great applau$e, for he is not content to provide for
things that might happen, the cour$e of Nature continuing, but
will $hew hic care in what may follow from tho$e things that he
very well knows $hall never come to pa$s. I will grant him there-
fore, (that I may get $om pretty pa$$ages out of him) that if the
Earth and Water $hould be reduced to nothing, there would be no
more hails or rains, nor would igneal matters a$cend any longer
upwards, but would continually turn round: what will follow?
what will the Philo$opher $ay then?</P>
<P>SIMP. The objection is in the words which immediately fol-
low; here they are: <I>Quibus tamen experientia &amp; ratio adver-
$atur.</I> Which neverthele$s ($aith he) is contrary to experience and
rea$on.</P>
<P>SALV. Now I mu$t yield, $eeing he hath $o great an advan-
tage of me as experience, of which I am unprovided. For as yet
I never had the fortune to $ee the Terre$trial Globe and the ele-
ment of Water turn'd to nothing, $o as to have been able to ob-
$erve what the hail and water did in that little Chaos. But he
perhaps tells us for our in$truction what they did.</P>
<P>SIMP. No, he doth not.</P>
<P>SALV. I would give any thing to change a word or two with
this per$on, to ask him, whether when this Globe vani$hed, it car-
ried away with it the common centre of gravity, as I believe it did;
in which ca$e, I think that the hail and water would remain in$en-
$ate and $tupid among$t the clouds, without knowing what to do
with them$elves. It might be al$o, that attracted by that great
void <I>Vacuum,</I> left by the Earths ab$enting, all the ambients would
be rarified, and particularly, the air, which is extreme ea$ily drawn,
and would run thither with very great ha$te to fill it up. And
perhaps the more $olid and material bodies, as birds, (for there
would in all probability be many of them $cattered up and down
in the air) would retire more towards the centre of the great va-
cant $phere; (for it $eemeth very rea$onable, that $ub$tances that
<foot>Ee 2 under</foot>
<p n=>220</p>
under $mall bulk contain much matter, $hould have narrower pla-
ces a$$igned them, leaving the more $pacious to the more rarified)
and there being dead of hunger, and re$olved into Earth, would
form a new little Globe, with that little water, which at that time
was among the clouds. It might be al$o, that tho$e matters as
not beholding the light, would not perceive the Earths departure,
but like blind things, would de$cend according to their u$ual cu$tom
to the centre, whither they would now go, if that globe did not
hinder them. And la$tly, that I may give this Philo$opher a le$s
irre$olute an$wer, I do tell him, that I know as much of what
would follow upon the annihilation of the Terre$trial Globe, as
he would have done that was to have followed in and about the
$ame, before it was created. And becau$e I am certain he will
$ay, that he would never have been able to have known any of
all tho$e things which experience alone hath made him knowing
in, he ought not to deny me pardon, and to excu$e me if I know
not that which he knows, touching what would en$ue upon the
annihilation of the $aid Globe: for that I want that experience
which he hath. Let us hear if he have any thing el$e to $ay.</P>
<P>SIMP. There remains this figure, which repre$ents the Terre-
$trial Globe with a great cavity about its centre, full of air; and
to $hew that <I>Graves</I> move not downwards to unite with the Ter-
re$trial Globe, as <I>Copernicus</I> $aith, he con$tituteth this $tone in
the centre; and demandeth, it being left at liberty, what it would
do; and he placeth another in the $pace of this great vacuum, and
asketh the $ame que$tion. Saying, as to the fir$t: <I>Lapis in centro
con$titutus, aut a$cendet ad terram in punctum aliquod, aut non. Si
$ecundum; fal$um est, partes ob $olam $ejunctionem &agrave; toto, ad il-
lud moveri. Si primum; omnis ratio &amp; experientia renititur,
neque gravia in $u&oelig; gravitatis centro conquie$cent. Item $i $u-
$pen$us lapis, liberatus decidat in centrum, $eparabit $e &agrave; toto, con-
tra</I> Copernicum<I>: $i pendeat, refragatur omnis experientia, c&ugrave;m
videamus integros fornices corruere.</I> (Wherein he $aith:) The
$tone placed in the centre, either a$cendeth to the Earth in $ome
point, or no. If the $econd, it is fal$e that the parts $eparated
from the whole, move unto it. If the fir$t; it contradicteth all
rea$on and experience, nor doth the grave body re$t in the centre
of its gravity. And if the $tone being $u$pended in the air, be let
go, do de$cend to the centre, it will $eparate from its whole, con-
trary to <I>Copernicus:</I> if it do hang in the air, it contradicteth all
experience: $ince we $ee whole Vaults to fall down.</P>
<P>SALV. I will an$wer, though with great di$advantage to my
$elf, $eeing I have to do with one who hath $een by experience,
what the$e $tones do in this great Cave: a thing, which for my
part I have not $een; and will $ay, that things grave have an exi-
<foot>$tence</foot>
<p n=>221</p>
$tence before the common centre of gravity: $o that it is not one
<marg><I>Things grave are

centre alone, which is no other than indivi$ible point, and therefore
of no efficacie, that can attract unto it grave matters; but that tho$e
matters con$piring naturally to unite, form to them$elves a com-
mon centre, which is that about which parts of equal moment
con$i$t: $o that I hold, that if the great aggregate of grave bo-
<marg><I>The great ma$s
of grave bodies be-
ing transferred out
of their place, the
$eparated parts
would follow that
ma&szlig;.</I></marg>
dies were gathered all into any one place, the $mall parts that were
$eparated from their whole, would follow the $ame, and if they
were not hindered, would penetrate wherever they $hould find
parts le$s grave than them$elves: but coming where they $hould
meet with matters more grave, they would de$cend no farther.
And therefore I hold, that in the Cave full of air, the whole Vault
would pre$s, and violently re$t it $elf onely upon that air, in ca$e
its hardne$s could not be overcome and broken by its gravity; but
loo$e $tones, I believe, would de$cend to the centre, and not $wim
above in the air: nor may it be $aid, that they move not to their
whole, though they move whither all the parts of the whole
would transfer them$elves, if all impediments were removed.</P>
<P>SIMP. That which remaineth, is a certain Errour which he ob-
$erveth in a Di$ciple of <I>Copernicus,</I> who making the Earth to
move with an annual motion, and a diurnal, in the $ame manner
as the Cart-wheel moveth upon the circle of the Earth, and in it
$elf, did con$titute the Terre$trial Globe too great, or the great
Orb too little; for that 365 revolutions of the &AElig;quinoctial, are
le$s by far than the circumference of the great Orb.</P>
<P>SALV. Take notice that you mi$take, and tell us the direct
contrary to what mu$t needs be written in that Book; for you
$hould $ay, that that $ame <I>Copernican</I> Author did con$titute the
Terre$trial Globe too little, and the great Orb too big; and not
the Terre$trial Globe too big, and the annual too little.</P>
<P>SIMP. The mi$take is not mine; $ee here the words of the
Book. <I>Non videt, qu&ograve;d vel circulum annuum &aelig;quo minorem, vel
orbem terreum ju$to mult&ograve; fabricet majorem.</I> (In Engli$h thus:)
He $eeth not, that he either maketh the annual circle equal to the
le$s, or the Terre$trial Orb much too big.</P>
<P>SALV. I cannot tell whether the fir$t Author erred or no, $ince
the Author of this Tractate doth not name him; but the error of
this Book is certain and unpardonable, whether that follower of
<I>Copernicus</I> erred or not erred; for that your Author pa$$eth by $o
material an error, without either detecting or correcting it. But
let him be forgiven this fault, as an error rather of inadvertencie,
than of any thing el$e: Farthermore, were it not, that I am al-
ready wearied and tired with talking and $pending $o mnch time
with very little profit, in the$e frivolous janglings and alterca-
tions, I could $hew, that it is not impo$$ible for a circle, though
<foot>no</foot>
<p n=>222</p>
<marg><I>It is not impo$$i-

no bigger than a Cart-wheel, with making not 365, but le$$e than

onely of the grand Orb, but of one a thou$and times greater;
and this I $ y to $hew, that there do not want far greater $ubtil-
ties, than this wherewith your Author goeth about to detect the
errour of <I>Copernicus</I>: but I pray you, let us breath a little, that
$o we may proceed to the other Philo$opher, that oppo$eth of the
$ame <I>Copernicus.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. To confe$$e the truth, I $tand as much in need of re-
$pite as either of you; though I have onely wearied my eares:
and were it not that I hope to hear more ingenious things from
this other Author, I que$tion whether I $hould not go my ways, to
<marg>Gondola.</marg>
take the air in my ^{*} Plea$ure-boat.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that you will hear things of greater moment;
for this is a mo$t accompli$hed Philo$opher, and a great Mathema-
tician, and hath confuted <I>Tycho</I> in the bu$ine$$e of the Comets,
and new Stars.</P>
<marg>* The name of
the <I>Author</I> is <I>Sci-
pie Claramontius.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. Perhaps he is the $ame with the Author of the Book,
called <I>Anti-Tycho</I>?</P>
<P>SIMP. He is the very $ame: but the confutation of the new
Stars is not in his <I>Anti-Tycho,</I> onely $o far as he proveth, that they
were not prejudicial to the inalterability and ingenerability of the
Heavens, as I told you before; but after he had publi$hed his
<I>Anti-Tycho,</I> having found out, by help of the Parallaxes, a way to
demon$trate, that they al$o are things elementary, and contained
within the concave of the Moon, he hath writ this other Book,
<I>de tribus uovis Stellis, &amp;c.</I> and therein al$o in$erted the Argu-
ments again$t <I>Copernicus</I>: I have already $hewn you what he
harh written touching the$e new Stars in his <I>Anti-Tycho,</I> where he
denied not, but that they were in the Heavens; but he proved, that
their production altered not the inalterability of the Heavens, and
that he did, with a Di$cour$e purely philo$ophical, in the $ame man
ner as you have already heard. And I then forgot to tell you, how
that he afterwards did finde out a way to remove them out of the
Heavens; for he proceeding in this confutation, by way of com-
putations and parallaxes, matters little or nothing at all under-
$tood by me, I did not mention them to you, but have bent all my
$tudies upon the$e arguments again$t the motion of the Earth,
which are purely natural.</P>
<P>SALV. I under$tand you very well: and it will be convenient
after we have heard what he hath to $ay again$t <I>Copernicus,</I> that
we hear, or $ee at lea$t the manner wherewith he, by way of Pa-
rallaxes, proveth tho$e new $tars to be elementary, which $o many
famous A$tronomers con$titute to be all very high, and among$t
the $tars of the Firmament; and as this Author accompli$heth $uch
<foot>an</foot>
<p n=>223</p>
an enterprize of pulling the new $tars out of heaven, and placing
them in the elementary Sphere, he $hall be worthy to be highly
exalted, and transferred him$elf among$t the $tars, or at lea$t,
that his name be by fame eternized among$t them. Yet before we
enter upon this, let us hear what he alledgeth again$t the opinion
of <I>Copernicus,</I> and do you begin to recite his Arguments.</P>
<P>SIMP. It will not be nece$$ary that we read them <I>ad verbum,</I>
becau$e they are very prolix; but I, as you may $ee, in reading
them $everal times attentively, have marked in the margine tho$e
words, wherein the $trength of his arguments lie, and it will
$uffice to read them. The $ir$t Argument beginneth here. <I>Et</I>
<marg><I>The opinion of</I>
Copernicus <I>over-
throws the</I> Crite-
rium <I>of Philo$ophy</I></marg>
<I>primo, $i opinio Copernici recipiatur, Criterium naturalis Philo-
$ophi&aelig;, ni pror$us tollatur, vehementer $altem labefactari
videtur.</I> [In our Idiom thus] And fir$t, if <I>Copernicus</I> his opinion
be imbraced, the <I>Criterium</I> of natural Philo$ophy will be, if not
wholly $ubverted, yet at lea$t extreamly $haken.</P>
<P>Which, according to the opinion of all the $ects of Philo$ophers
requireth, that Sen$e and Experience be our guides in philo$opha-
ting: But in the <I>Copernican</I> po$ition the Sen$es are greatly delu-
ded, whil'$t that they vi$ibly di$cover neer at hand in a pure <I>Medi-
um,</I> the grave$t bodies to de$cend perpendicularly downwards, ne-
ver deviating a $ingle hairs breadth from rectitude; and yet accor-
ding to the opinion of <I>Copernicus,</I> the $ight in $o manife$t a thing
is deceived, and that motion is not reall $traight, but mixt of
right and circular.</P>
<P>SALV. This is the fir$t argument, that <I>Ari$totle, Ptolomy,</I> and
all their followers do produce; to which we have abundant-
ly an$wered, and $hewn the Paralogi$me, and with $ufficient
plainne$$e proved, that the motion in common to us and other mo-
veables, is, as if there were no $uch thing; but becau$e true con-
clu$ions meet with a thou$and accidents, that confirme them, I
<marg><I>Common motion
is, as if it never
were.</I></marg>
will, with the favour of this Philo$opher, adde $omething more;
and you <I>Simplicius</I> per$onating him, an$wer me to what I $hall
ask you: And fir$t tell me, what effect hath that $tone upon you,
<marg><I>The argument
taken from things
falling perpendicu-
larly, another way
confuted.</I></marg>
which falling from the top of the Tower, is the cau$e that you per-
ceive that motion; for if its fall doth operate upon you neither
more nor le$$e, than its $tanding $till on the Towers top, you
doubtle$$e could not di$cern its de$cent, or di$tingui$h its moving
from its lying $till.</P>
<P>SIMP. I comprehend its moving, in relation to the Tower,
for that I $ee it one while ju$t again$t $uch a mark in the $aid
Tower, and another while again$t another lower, and $o $ucce$-
$ively, till that at la$t I perceive it arrived at the ground.</P>
<P>SALV. Then if that $tone were let fall from the tallons of an
Eagle flying, and $hould de$cend thorow the $imple invi$ible Air,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>224</p>
and you had no other object vi$ible and $table, wherewith to make
compari$ons to that, you could not perceive its motion?</P>
<P>SIMP. No, nor the $tone it $elf; for if I would $ee it, when
<marg><I>Whence the mo-
tion of a cadent bo-
dy is collected.</I></marg>
it is at the highe$t, I mu$t rai$e up my head, and as it de$cendeth
I mu$t hold it lower and lower, and in a word, mu$t continually
move either that, or my eyes, following the motion of the $aid
$tone.</P>
<P>SALV. You have now rightly an$wered: you know then that
<marg><I>The motion of
the eye argueth
the motion of the
object looked on.</I></marg>
the $tone lyeth $till, when without moving your eye, you alwayes
$ee it before you; and you know that it moveth, when for the
keeping it in $ight, you mu$t move the organ of $ight, the eye. So
then when ever without moving your eye, you continually be-
hold an object in the $elf $ame a$pect, you do always judge it
immoveable.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think it mu$t needs be $o.</P>
<P>SALV. Now fancy your $elf to be in a $hip, and to have fixed
your eye on the point of the Sail-yard: Do you think, that be-
cau$e the $hip moveth very fa$t, you mu$t move your eye, to keep
your $ight alwayes upon the point of the Sail-yard, and to fol-
low its motion?</P>
<P>SIMP. I am certain, that I $hould need to make no change at
all; and that not only in the $ight; but if I had aimed a Musket
at it, I $hould never have need, let the $hip move how it will,
to $tir it an hairs breadth to keep it full upon the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. And this happens becau$e the motion, which the Ship
conferreth on the Sail-yard, it conferreth al$o upon you, and upon
your eye; $o that you need not $tir it a jot to behold the top of
the Sail-yard: and con$equently, it will $eem to you immovea-
able. Now this Di$cour$e being applied to the revolution of the
Earth, and to the $tone placed in the top of the Tower, in which
you cannot di$cern any motion, becau$e that you have that mo-
tion which is nece$$ary for the following of it, in common with it
from the Earth; $o that you need not move your eye. When a-
gain there is conferred upon it the motion of de$cent, which is its
particular motion, and not yours, and that it is intermixed with the
circular, that part of the circular which is common to the $tone,
and to the eye, continueth to be imperceptible, and the right one-
ly is perceived, for that to the perception of it, you mu$t follow it
with your eye, looking lower and lower. I wi$h for the undecei-
ving of this Philo$opher, that I could advi$e him, that $ome time
<marg><I>An experiment

the common motion
is imperceptible.</I></marg>
or other going by water, he would carry along with him a Ve$$el
of rea$onable depth full of water, and prepare a ball of wax, or
other matter that would de$cend very $lowly to the bottome, $o
that in a minute of an hour, it would $carce $ink a yard; and that
rowing the boat as fa$t as could be, $o that in a minute of an hour
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>225</p>
it $hould run above an hundred yards, he would let the ball $ub-
merge into the water, &amp; freely de$cend, &amp; diligently ob$erve its mo-
tion. If he would but do thus, he $hould $ee, fir$t, that it would go in a
direct line towards that point of the bottom of the ve$$el, whither it
would tend, if the boat $hould $tand $till; &amp; to his eye, and in rela-
tion to the ve$$el, that motion would appear mo$t $traight and per-
pendicular, and yet he could not $ay, but that it would be compo$ed
of the right motion downwards, and of the circular about the ele-
ment of water. And if the$e things befall in matters not natural,
and in things that we may experiment in their $tate of re$t; &amp; then
again in the contrary $tate of motion, and yet as to appearance no
diver$ity at all is di$covered, &amp; that they $eem to deceive our $en$e
what can we di$tingui$h touching the Earth, which hath been per-
petually in the $ame con$titution, as to motion and re$t? And in
what time can we experiment whether any difference is di$cernable
among$t the$e accidents of local motion, in its diver$e $tates of mo-
tion and re$t, if it eternally indureth in but one onely of them?</P>
<P>SAGR. The$e Di$cour$es have $omewhat whetted my $tomack,
which tho$e fi$hes, and $nails had in part nau$eated; and the former
made me call to minde the correction of an errour, that hath $o
much appearance of truth, that I know not whether one of a
thou$and would refu$e to admit it as unque$tionable. And it was
this, that $ailing into <I>Syria,</I> and carrying with me a very good
<I>Tele$cope,</I> that had been be$towed on me by our <I>Common Friend,</I>
who not many dayes before had invented, I propo$ed to the Ma-
riners, that it would be of great benefit in Navigation to make u$e
of it upon the round top of a $hip, to di$cover and kenne Ve$$els
afar off. The benefit was approved, but there was objected the

difficulty of u$ing it, by rea$on of the Ships continual fluctuation;
and e$pecially on the round top, where the agitation is $o much
greater, and that it would be better for any one that would make
u$e thereof to $tand at the Partners upon the upper Deck, where
the to$$ing is le$$e than in any other place of the Ship. I (for I
will not conceal my errour) concurred in the $ame opinion, and
for that time $aid no more: nor can I tell you by what hints I was
moved to return to ruminate with my $elf upon this bu$ine$$e, and
in the end came to di$cover my $implicity (although excu$able) in
admitting that for true, which is mo$t fal$e; fal$e I $ay, that the
great agitation of the basket or round top, in compari$on of the
$mall one below, at the partners of the Ma$t, $hould render the
u$e of the <I>Tele$cope</I> more difficult in finding out the object.</P>

$tray from the point ob$erved in the object, more than tho$e fif-
teen fathom; and becau$e in a di$tance of eight or ten miles, the
In$trument takes in a much greater $pace than the Gally or other
Ve$$el kenn'd; therefore that $mall mutation $hall not make me
lo$e $ight of her. The impediment therefore, and the cau$e of
lo$ing the object cannot befall us, unle$$e upon the mutation made
angularly; $ince that <I>Tele$copes</I> tran$portation higher or lower, to
the right, or to the left, by the agitation of the $hip, cannot import
any great number of fathomes. Now $uppo$e that you had two
<I>Tele$copes</I> fixed, one at the Partners clo$e by the Deck, and the o-
ther at the round top, nay at the main top, or main top-gallant
top, where you hang forth the <I>Pennon</I> or $treamer, and that they
be both directed to the Ve$$el that is ten miles off, tell me, whe-
ther you believe that any agitation of the $hip, &amp; inclination of the
Ma$t, can make greater changes, as to the angle, in the higher tube,
than in the lower? One wave a<*>i$ing, the prow will make the main
top give back fifteen or twenty fathom more than the foot of the
Ma$t, and it $hall carry the upper tube along with it $o greata $pace,
&amp; the lower it may be not a palm; but the angle $hall change in one
In$trument a$well as in the other; and likewi$e a $ide-billow $hall
bear the higher tube an hundred times as far to the Larboard or
Starboard, as it will the other below; but the angles change not at
all, or el$e alter both alike. But the mutation to the right hand or
left, forwards or backwards, upwards or downwards, bringeth no
$en$ible impediment in the kenning of objects remote, though the
alteration of the angle maketh great change therein; Therefore it
mu$t of nece$$ity be confe$$ed, that the u$e of the <I>Tele$cope</I> on the
round top is no more difficult than upon the Deck at the Partners;
$eeing that the angular mutations are alike in both places.</P>
<P>SALV. How much circum$pection is there to be u$ed in affirming
or denying a propo$ition? I $ay again, thar hearing it re$olutely affir-
med, that there is a greater motion made on the Ma$ts top, than at
its partners, every one will per$wade him$elf, that the u$e of the <I>Te-
le$cope</I> is much more difficult above than below. And thus al$o I w
ill excu$e tho$e Philo$ophers, who grow impatient and fly out into
pa$$ion again$t $uch as will not grant them, that that Cannon bullet
which they cleerly $ee to fall in a right line perpendicularly, doth
ab$olutely move in that manner; but will have its motion to be by
an arch, and al$o very much inclined and tran$ver$al: but let us
leave them in the$e labyrinths, and let us hear the other objections,
that our Author in hand brings again$t <I>Copernicus.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. The Author goeth on to demon$trate that in the Do-
ctrine of <I>Copernicus,</I> it is requi$ite to deny the Sen$es, and the
<foot>Ff 2 greate$t</foot>
<p n=>228</p>
greate$t Sen$ations, as for in$tance it would be, if we that feel the

tion of the Earth

re$pirations of a gentle gale, $hould not feel the impul$e of a per-
petual winde that beateth upon us with a velocity that runs more
than 2529 miles an hour, for $o much is the $pace that the centre
of the Earth in its annual motion pa$$eth in an hour upon the cir-
cumference of the grand Orb, as he diligently calculates; and
becau$e, as he $aith, by the judgment of <I>Copernicus, Cum terra
movetur circumpo$itus a&euml;r, motus tamen ejus, velocior licet ac ra-
pidior celerrimo quocunque vento, &agrave; nohis non $entiretur, $ed $um-
ma tum tranquilitas reputaretur, ni$i alius motus accederet. Quid
e$t ver&ograve; decipi $en$um, ni$i h&aelig;c e$$et deceptio</I>? [<I>Which I make to
$peak to this $en$e.</I>] The circumpo$ed air is moved with the Earth,
yet its motion, although more $peedy and rapid than the $wifte$t
wind what$oever, would not be perceived by us, but then would
be thought a great tranquillity, unle$$e $ome other motion $hould
happen; what then is the deception of the $en$e, if this be
not?</P>
<P>SALV. It mu$t needs be that this Philo$opher thinketh, that
that Earth which <I>Copernicus</I> maketh to turn round, together with
the ambient air along the circumference of the great Orb, is not that
whereon we inhabit, but $ome other $eparated from this; for that this
of ours carrieth us al$o along with it with the $ame velocity, as al-
<marg><I>The air alwayes
touching us with
the $ame part of it
cannot make us
<*>eel it.</I></marg>
$o the circumjacent air: And what beating of the air can we feel,
when we fly with equal $peed from that which $hould acco$t us?
This Gentleman forgot, that we no le$s than the Earth and air are
carried about, and that con$equently we are always touch'd by
one and the $ame part of the air, which yet doth not make us feel
it.</P>
<P>SIMP. But I rather think that he did not $o think; hear the
words which immediately follow. <I>Pr&aelig;terea nos quoque rotamur
ex circumductione terr&aelig; &amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Now I can no longer help nor excu$e him; do you
plead for him and bring him off, <I>Simplicius.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. I cannot thus upon the $udden think of an excu$e that
plea$eth me.</P>
<P>SALV. Go to; take this whole night to think on it, and de-
fend him to morrow; in the mean time let us hear $ome other of
his objections.</P>
<P>SIMP. He pro$ecuteth the $ame Objection, $hewing, that in the
<marg><I>He that will fol-
low</I> Copernicus,
<I>must deny his $er-
$es.</I></marg>
way of <I>Copernicus,</I> a man mu$t deny his own $en$es. For that
this principle whereby we turn round with the Earth, either is
intrin$ick to us, or external; that is, a rapture of that Earth; and
if it be this $econd, we not feeling any $uch rapture, it mu$t be
confe$$ed that the $en$e of feeling, doth not feel its own object
touching it, nor its impre$$ion on the $en$ible part: but if the prin-
<foot>ciple</foot>
<p n=>229</p>
ciple be intrin$ecal, we $hall not perceive a local motion that is de-
rived from our $elves, and we $hall never di$cover a propen$ion per-
petually annexed to our $elves.</P>
<P>SALV. So that the in$tance of this Philo$opher lays its $tre$s up-
on this, that whether the principle by which we move round with
the Earth be either extern, or intern, yet however we mu$t per-
ceive it, and not perceiving it, it is neither the one nor the other,
and therefore we move not, nor con$equently the Earth. Now I
<marg><I>Our motion may
be either interne or
externe, and yet
we never perceive
or feel it.</I></marg>
$ay, that it may be both ways, and yet we not perceive the $ame.
And that it may be external, the experiment of the boat $upera-
bundantly $atis$ieth me; I $ay, $uperabundantly, becau$e it being
in our power at all times to make it move, and al$o to make it
$tand $till, and with great exactne$s to make ob$ervation, whether
by $ome diver$ity that may be comprehended by the $en$e of feel-
ing, we can come to know whether it moveth or no, $eeing that
as yet no $uch $cience is obtained: Will it then be any matter of
wonder, if the $ame accident is unknown to us on the Earth, the
which may have carried us about perpetually, and we, without our
<marg><I>The motion of a
Boat in$en$ible to
tho$e that are with
in it, as to the $en$e
of feeling.</I></marg>
being ever able to experiment its re$t? You, <I>Simplicius,</I> as I be-
lieve, have gone by boat many times to <I>Padoua,</I> and if you will
confe$s the truth, you never felt in your $elf the participation of
that motion, unle$s when the boat running a-ground, or encoun-
tring $ome ob$tacle, did $top, and that you with the other Pa$$en-
gers being taken on a $udden, were with danger over-$et. It
would be nece$$ary that the Terre$trial Globe $hould meet with
$ome rub that might arre$t it, for I a$$ure you, that then you
would di$cern the impul$e re$iding in you, when it $hould to$s you
up towards the Stars. It's true, that by the other $en$es, but yet
<marg><I>The boats moti-
on is perceptible to
the $ight joyn'd
with rea$on.</I></marg>
a$$i$ted by Rea$on, you may perceive the motion of the boat, that
is, with the $ight, in that you $ee the trees and buildings placed on
the $hoar, which being $eparated from the boat, $eem to move the
<marg><I>The terre$trial

contrary way. But if you would by $uch an experiment receive
intire $atisfaction in this bu$ine$s of the Terre$trial motion, look
on the $tars, which upon this rea$on $eem to move the contrary
way. As to the wondering that we $hould not feel $uch a prin-
ciple, $uppo$ing it to be internal, is a le$s rea$onable conceit; for
if we do not feel $uch a one, that cometh to us from without,
and that frequently goeth away, with what rea$on can we expect
to feel it, if it immutably and continually re$ides in us? Now let
us $ee what you have farther to allege on this argument.</P>
<P>SIMP. Take this $hort exclamation. <I>Ex hac itaque opinione
nece$$e est diffidere no$tris $en$ibus, ut penit&ugrave;s fall acibus vel $tupidis
in $en$ilibus, etiam conjuncti$$imis, dijudicandis. Quam erg&ograve; ve-

[Which I render thus:] From this opinion likewi$e, we mu$t of
<foot>nece$$ity</foot>
<p n=>230</p>
nece$$ity $u$pect our own $en$es, as wholly fallible, or $tupid in
judging of $en$ible things even very near at hand. What truth
therefore can we hope for, to be derived from $o deceiveable a fa-
culty?</P>
<P>SALV. But I de$ire not to deduce precepts more profitable, or
more certain, learning to be more circum$pect and le$s confident
about that which at fir$t blu$h is repre$ented to us by the $en$es,
which may ea$ily deceive us. And I would not have this Author
trouble him$elf in attemptiug to make us comprehend by $en$e,
that this motion of de$cending Graves is $imply right, and of
no other kind; nor let him exclaim that a thing $o clear, manife$t,
and obvious $hould be brought in que$tion; for in $o doing, he
maketh others believe, that he thinketh tho$e that deny that mo-
tion to be ab$olutely $treight, but rather circular, the $tone did
$en$ibly $ee it to move in an arch, $eeing that he inviteth their $en$es
more than their Rea$on, to judg of that effect: which is not true,
<I>Simplicius,</I> for like as I, that am indifferent in all the$e opini-
ons, and onely in the manner of a Comedian, per$onate <I>Coperni-
cus</I> in the$e our repre$entations, have never $een, nor thought
that I have $een that $tone fall otherwi$e than perpendicularly,
$o I believe, that to the eyes of all others it $eemed to do the
$ame. Better it is therefore, that depo$ing that appearance in
which all agree, we make u$e of our Rea$on, either to confirm the
reality of that, or to di$cover its fallacy.</P>
<P>SAGR. If I could any time meet with this Philo$opher, who
yet me thinks is more $ublime than the re$t of the followers of
the $ame doctrines, I would in token of my affection put him in
mind of an accident which he hath doubtle$s very often beheld;
from which, with great conformity to that which we now di$cour$e
of, it may be collected how ea$ily one may be deceived by the bare
appearance, or, if you will, repre$entation of the $en$e. And the
accident is, the Moons $eeming to follow tho$e that walk the $treets
in the night, with a pace equal to theirs, whil$t they $ee it go gli-
ding along the Roofs of hou$es, upon which it $heweth ju$t like a
cat, that really running along the ridges of hou$es, leaveth them
behind. An appearance that, did not rea$on interpo$e, would but
too manife$tly delude the $ight.</P>
<P>SIMP. Indeed there want not experiments that render us cer-
<marg><I>Arguments a-
gain$t the Earths
motion taken,</I> ex
rerum natura.</marg>
tain of the fallacy of the meer $en$es; therefore $u$pending $uch
$en$ations for the pre$ent, let us hear the Arguments that follow
which are taken, as he $aith, <I>ex rerum natur&acirc;.</I> The fir$t of which
is, that the Earth cannot of its own nature move with three moti-
ons very different; or otherwi$e we mu$t deny many manife$t
<marg><I>Three Axioms
that are $uppo$ed
manife$t.</I></marg>
Axioms. The fir$t whereof is, that <I>Omn&iuml;s effectus dependeat ab
aliqu&acirc; cau$&acirc;; [i. e.]</I> that every effect dependeth on $ome cau$e.
<foot>The</foot>
<p n=>231</p>
The $econd, that <I>Nulla res $eip$am producat; [i. e.]</I> that nothing
produceth it $elf: from whence it follows, that it is not po$$i-
ble that the mover and moved $hould be totally the $ame thing:
And this is manife$t, not onely in things that are moved by an ex-
trin$ick mover; but it is gathered al$o from the principles pro-
pounded, that the $ame holdeth true in the natural motion depen-
dent on an intrin$ick principle; otherwi$e, being that the mover,
as a mover, is the cau$e, and the thing moved, as moved, is the
effect, the $ame thing would totally be both the cau$e and effect.
Therefore a body doth not move its whole $elf, that is, $o as
that all moveth, and all is moved; but its nece$$ary in the thing
moved to di$tingui$h in $ome manner the efficient principle of the
motion, and that which with that motion is moved. The third
Axiom is, that <I>in rebus qu&aelig; $en$ui $ubjiciuntur, unum, quatenus
unum, unam $olam rem producat; i. e.</I> That in things $ubject to
the $en$es, one, as it is one, produceth but onely one thing: That
is, the $oul in animals produceth its true divers operations, as the
$ight, the hearing, the $mell, generation, <I>&amp;c.</I> but all the$e with
$everal in$truments. And in $hort, in things $en$ible, the diver$i-
ty of operations, is ob$erved to derive it $elf from the diver$ity
that is in the cau$e. Now if we put all the$e Axioms together, it
<marg><I>A $imple body
as the Earth, can-
not move with
three $everal moti-
ons.</I></marg>
will be a thing very manife$t, that one $imple body, as is the
Earth, cannot of its own nature move at the $ame time with
three motions, very divers: For by the foregoing $uppo$itions,
all moveth not its $elf all; it is nece$fary therefore to di$tingui$h
in it three principles of its three motions; otherwi$e one and the
$ame principle would produce many motions; but if it contein in
it three principles of natural motions, be$ides the part moved, it
$hall not be a $imple body, but compounded of three principle
movers, and of the part moved. If therefore the Earth be a $im-
<marg><I>The Earth can-
not move with any
of the motions a$$i-
gned it by</I> Coperni-
cus.</marg>
ple body, it $hall not move with three motions; nay more, it will
not move with any of tho$e which <I>Copernicus</I> a$cribeth to it, it
being to move but with one alone, for that it is manife$t, by the
rea$ons of <I>Ari$totle,</I> that it moveth to its centre, as its parts do
$hew, which de$cend at right angles to the Earths Spherical
Surface.</P>
<P>SALV. Many things might be $aid, and con$idered touching
the connection of this argument; but in regard that we can re-
<marg><I>An$wers to the
arguments contra-
ry to the Earths
motion, taken</I> ex
rerum natura.</marg>
$olve it in few words, I will not at this time without need inlarge
upon it; and $o much the rather, becau$e the $ame Author hath
furni$hed me with an an$wer, when he $aith that from one $ole prin-
ple in animals, there are produced divers operations; $o that for
the pre$ent my an$wer $hall be, that in the $ame manner the Earth
from one onely principle deriveth $everal operations.</P>
<P>SIMP. But this an$wer will not at all $atisfie the Author who
<foot>makes</foot>
<p n=>232</p>
makes the objection, yea, it is totally overthrown by that which
immediately after he addeth for a greater confirmation of his argu-
ment, as you $hall hear. He re-inforceth his argument, I $ay, with
<marg><I>A fourth Ax-
iome again$t the
motion of the Earth</I></marg>
another Axiome, which is this; That <I>natura in rebus nece$$ari is
nec deficiat, nec abundat: i.e.</I> That nature in things nece$$ary is
neither defective, nor $uperfluous. This is obvious to the ob$er-
<marg><I>Flexures nece$-
$ary in animals for
the diver$ity of
their motions.</I></marg>
vers of natural things, and chiefly of animals, in which, becau$e
they are to move with many motions, Nature hath made many
flexures, and hath thereunto commodiou$ly knitted the parts for
motion, as to the knees, to the hips, for the inabling of living
creatures to go, and run at their plea$ure. Moreover in man he
hath framed many flexions, and joynts, in the elbow, and hand, to
enable them to perform many motions. From the$e things the ar-
<marg><I>Another argu-
ment again$t the
three fold motion of
the Earth.</I></marg>
gument is taken again$t the threefold motion of the Earth. [<I>Ei-
ther the Body, that is one, and continuate, without any manner of
knittings or flexions, can exerci$e divers motions, or cannot: If it
can without them, then in vain hath nature framed the flexures in
animals; which is contrary to the Axiome: but if it cannot with-
out them, then the Earth, one body, and continuate, and deprived of
flexures, and joynts, cannot of its own nature move with plurali-
ty of motions.</I>] You $ee now how craftily he falls upon your an-
$wer, as if he had fore$een it.</P>
<P>SALV. Are you $erious, or do you je$t?</P>
<P>SIMP. I $peak it with the be$t judgment I have.</P>
<P>SALV. You mu$t therefore $ee that you have as fortunate an
hand in defending the reply of this Philo$opher, again$t $ome o-
ther rejoynders made to him; therefore an$wer for him, I pray
you, $eeing we cannot have him here. You fir$t admit it for true,
that Nature hath made the joynts, flexures, and knuckles of li-
ving creatures, to the intent that they might move with $nndry
and divers motions; and I deny this propo$ition; and $ay, that
the$e flexions are made, that the animal may move one, or more
<marg><I>The Flexures in
animals are not
made for the di-
ver$ity of motions.</I></marg>
of its parts, the re$t remaining immoved: and I $ay, that as to the
$pecies and differences of motions tho$e are of one kind alone, to
wit, all circular, and for this cau$e you $ee all the ends of the mo-
<marg><I>The motions of
animals are of one
$ort.</I></marg>
veable bones to be convex or concave, and of the$e $ome are $phe-
rical, as are tho$e that are to move every way, as in the $houlder-
<marg><I>The ends of the
bones are all ro-
tund.</I></marg>
joynt, the arme of the En$igne doth, in di$playing the Colours,
and that of the Falconer in bringing his Hawk to the lure; and
$uch is the flexure of the elbow, upon which the hand turns round,
in boring with an augure: others are circular onely one way, and
as it were cylindrical, which $erve for the members that bend one-
<marg><I>It is demon$tra-
ted, that the ends
of the bones are of
nece$$ity to be ro-
tund.</I></marg>
ly in one fa$hion, as the joynts of the fingers one above another,
&amp;c. But without more particular inductions, one only general di$-
cour$e may make this truth under$tood; and this is, that of a $olid
<foot>body</foot>
<p n=>233</p>
body that moveth, one of its extreams $tanding $till without chan-
ching place, the motion mu$t needs be circular, and no other: and
<marg><I>The motions of
animals are all
circular.</I></marg>
becau$e in the living creatures moving, one of its members doth
not $eparate from the other its conterminal, therefore that motion
is of nece$$ity circular.</P>
<P>SIMP. How can this be? For I $ee the animal move with an
hundred motions that are not circular, and very different from one
another, as to run, to skip, to climbe, to de$cend, to $wim, and
many others.</P>
<marg><I>Secondary moti-
ons of animals de-
pendent on the fir$t</I></marg>
<P>SALV. Tis well: but the$e are $econdary motions, depending
on the preceding motions of the joynts and flexures. Upon the
plying of the legs to the knees, and the thighs to the hips, which
are circular motions of the parts, is produced, as con$equents, the
skip, or running, which are motions of the whole body, and the$e
may po$$ibly not be circular. Now becau$e one part of the ter-
<marg><I>The</I> Terre$triall
Globe <I>hath noe
need of flexures.</I></marg>
re$trial Globe is not required to move upon another part immove-
able, but that the motion is to be of the whole body, there is no
need in it of flexures.</P>
<P>SIMP. This (will the aduer$ary rejoyn) might be, if the moti-
on were but one alone, but they being three, and tho$e very dif-
ferent from each other, it is not po$$ible that they $hould concur in
<marg>* Without joynts</marg>
an ^{*} articulate body.</P>
<P>SALV. I verily believe that this would be the an$wer of the
Philo$opher. Again$t which I make oppo$ition another way; and
ask you, whether you think that by way of joynts and flexures one
may adapt the terre$trial Globe to the participation of three diffe-
rent circular motions? Do you not an$wer me? Seeing you are
$peechle$$e, I will undertake to an$wer for the Philo$opher, who
would ab$olutely reply that they might; for that otherwi$e it
would have been $uperfluous, and be$ides the purpo$e to have pro-
po$ed to con$ideration, that nature maketh the flexions, to the
end, the moveable may move with different motions; and that
therefore the terre$trial Globe having no flexures, it cannot have
tho$e three motions which are a$cribed to it. For if he had
thought, that neither by help of flexures, it could be rendered apt
for $uch motions, he would have freely affirmed, that the Globe
could not move with three motions. Now granting this, I intreat
<marg><I>It is de$ired to
know, by means of
what flexures and
joynts the</I> Terre-
$trial Globe <I>might
move with three
diver$e motions.</I></marg>
you, and by you, if it were po$$ible, that Philo$opher, Au-
thor of the Argument, to be $o courteous as to teach me in what
manner tho$e flexures $hould be accommodated, $o that tho$e
three motions might commodiou$ly be excerci$ed; and I grant you
four or $ix moneths time to think of an an$wer. As to me, it $eem-
eth that one principle onely may cau$e a plurality of motions in
<marg><I>One only princi-
ple may cau$e a
plurality of moti-
ons in the Earth.</I></marg>
the Terre$trial Globe, ju$t in the $ame manner that, as I told you
before, one onely principle with the help of various in$truments
<foot>Gg pro-</foot>
<p n=>234</p>
produceth $undry and divers motions in living creatures. And as
to the flexures there is no need of them, the motions being of the
whole, and not of $ome particular parts; and becau$e they are
to be circular, the meer $pherical figure is the mo$t perfect articu-
lation or flection that can be de$ired.</P>
<P>SIMP. The mo$t that ought to be granted upon this, would be,
that it may hold true in one $ingle motion, but in three different
motions, in my opinion, and that of the Author, it is impo$$i-
ble; as he going on, pro$ecuting the objection, writes in the fol-
lowing words. <I>Let us $uppo$e, with</I> Copernicus, <I>that the Earth
moveth of its own faculty, and upon an intrin$ick principle from
We$t to Ea$t in the plane of the Ecliptick; and again, that it al$o
by an intrin$ick principle revolveth about its centre, from Ea$t to
We$t; and for a third motion, that it of its own inclination defle-
cteth from North to South, and $o back again.</I> It being a conti-
nuate body, and not knit together with joints and flections, our
fancy and our judgment will never be able to comprehend, that
one and the $ame natural and indi$tinct principle, that is, that
one and the $ame propen$ion, $hould actuate it at the $ame in$tant
with different, and as it were of contrary motions. I cannot be-
lieve that any one would $ay $uch a thing, unle$$e he had under-
took to maintain this po$ition right or wrong.</P>
<P>SALV. Stay a little; and find me out this place in the Book.

Where doth he find that <I>Copernicus</I> maketh the annual motion
by the Ecliptick contrary to the motion about its own centre? It

places, and in the very fir$t Chapters affirmeth tho$e motions to
be both towards the $ame parts, that is from We$t to Ea$t.

prehend, that attributing to the Earth the motions that are ta

<p n=>235</p>
Ea$t to We$t? And the annual motion of the Sun through the
Ecliptick, is it not on the contrary from We$t to Ea$t? How

with a contrary motion would go down; and that con$equently
the Earth would reoolve in it $elf a contrary way to that where-
with the Stars $eem to move, that is from We$t to Ea$t, which
is according to the order of the Signes of the Zodiack. As, in the
next place, to the other motion, the Sun being fixed in the cen-
tre of the Zodiack, and the Earth moveable about its circumfe-
rence, to make the Sun $eem unto us to move about the $aid Zo-
diack, according to the order of the Signes, it is nece$$ary, that
the E arth move according to the $ame order, to the end that the
Sun may $eem to us to po$$e$$e alwayes that degree in the Zodiack,
that is oppo$ite to the degree in which we find the Earth; and thus
the Earth running, <I>verbi gratia,</I> through <I>Aries,</I> the Sun will
appear to run thorow <I>Libra</I>; and the Earth pa$$ing thorow the
$igne <I>Taurus,</I> the Sun will pa$$e thorow <I>Scorpio,</I> and $o the

<P>SALV. And yet, <I>Simplicius,</I> there is one yet wor$e then this; and
it is, that he makes the Earth move by the diurnal motion about
its own centre from Ea$t to We$t; and perceives not that if this
were $o, the motion of twenty four hours appropriated by him
to the Univer$e, would, in our $eeming, proceed from We$t to
Ea$t; the quite contrary to that which we behold.</P>

cribes unto it conjunctly with the other two, annual and diurnal,
which hath nothing to do with declining towards the South and
North; but onely $erveth to keep the axis of the diurnal revoluti-
on continually parallel to it $elf; $o that it mu$t be confe$t, that
either the Authour did not under$tand this, or that el$e he di$$em-
bled it. But although this great mi$take $ufficeth to free us from
any obligation of a farther enquiry into his objections; yet ne-
verthele$$e I $hall have them in e$teem; as indeed they de$erve to
be valued much before the many others of impertinent Antago-
ni$ts. Returning therefore to his objection, I $ay, that the two
motions, annual and diurnal, are not in the lea$t contrary, nay are
towards the $ame way, and therefore may depend on one and the
$ame principle. The third is of it $elf, and voluntarily $o con$equen-
tial to the annual, that we need not trouble our $elves (as I $hall
$hew in its place) to $tudy for principles either internal or external,
from which, as from its cau$e, to make it produced.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $hall al$o, as being induced thereto by natural rea$on,
$ay $omething to this Antagoni$t. He will condemn <I>Copernicus,</I>
unle$$e I be able to an$wer him to all objections, and to $atisfie
him in all que$tions he $hall ask; as if my ignorance were a nece$-
$ary argument of the fal$hood of his Doctrine. But if this way of
condemning Writers be in his judgment legal, he ought not to
think it unrea$onable, if I $hould not approve of <I>Ar&icirc;$totle</I> and <I>Pto-
lomy,</I> when he cannot re$olve, better than my $elf, tho$e doubts
which I propound to him, touching their Doctrine. He asketh me,
what are the principles by which the Terre$trial Globe is moved
<marg><I>The $ame argu-

with the Annual motion through the Zodiack, and with the Diur-
nal through the Equinoctial about its own axis. I an$wer, that
they are like to tho$e by which <I>Saturn</I> is moved about the Zodi-
ack in thirty years, and about its own centre in a much $horter
time along the Equinoctial, as the collateral apparition and oc-
cultation of its Globes doth evince. They are principles like to
tho$e, whereby he $crupleth not to grant, that the Sun runneth tho-
row the Ecliptick in a year, and revolveth about its own centre
parallel to the Equinoctial in le$$e than a moneth, as its $pots doth
$en$ibly demon$trate. They are things like to tho$e whereby the
Medicean Stars run through the Zodiack in twelve years, and
all the while revolve in $mall circles, and $hort periods of time a-
bout <I>Jupiter.</I></P>

<P>SAGR. But this would be to draw a further inconvenience up-
on him$elf, in that he holdeth, that the bare eye cannot be decei-
ved in judging of the right motion of de$cending graves, and yet
holds that it is deceived in beholding the$e other motions at $uch
time as its vi$ive vertue is perfected, and augmented to thirty times
as much as it was before. We tell him therefore, that the Earth in
like manner partaketh of the plurality of motions: and it is per-
haps the $ame, whereby the Load$tone hath its motion down-
wards, as grave, and two circular motions, one Horizontal, and the
other Vertical under the Meridian. But what more; tell me, <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> between which do you think this Author would put a
greater difference, 'twixt right and circular motion, or 'twixt moti-
on and re$t?</P>
<P>SIMP. 'Twixt motion and re$t, certainly. And this is mani-
<marg><I>Motion and re$t
are more different
than right motion
and circular.</I></marg>
fe$t, for that circular motion is not contrary to the right, according
to <I>Aristotle</I>; nay, he granteth that they may mix with each o-
ther; which it is impo$$ible for motion and re$t to do.</P>
<P>SAGR. Therefore its a propo$ition le$$e improbable to place
in one natural body two internal principles, one to right motion,
and the other to circular, than two $uch interne principles one to
motion, and the other to re$t. Now both the$e po$itions agree to
<marg><I>One may more
rationally a$cribe
to the Earth two
internal principles
to the right, and
circular motion,
than two to motion
and re$t.</I></marg>
the natural inclination that re$ideth in the parts of the Earth to re-
turn to their whole, when by violence they are divided from it;
and they onely di$$ent in the operation of the whole: for the lat-
ter of them will have it by an interne principle to $tand $till, and
the former a$cribeth to it the circular motion. But by your con-
ce$$ion, and the confe$$ion of this Philo$opher, two principles, one
to motion, and the other to re$t, are incompatible together, like as
their effects are incompatible: but now this evenes not in the two
motions, right, and circular, which have no repugnance to each
other.</P>
<P>SALV. Adde this more, that in all probability it may be that
<marg><I>The motion of
the parts of the
Earth returning to
their whole may be
circular.</I></marg>
the motion, that the part of the Earth $eparated doth make whil$t
it returneth towards its whole, is al$o circular, as hath been alrea-
dy declared; $o that in all re$pects, as far as concernes the pre$ent
ca$e, Mobility $eemeth more likely than Re$t. Now proceed,
<I>Simplicius,</I> to what remains.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Authour backs his Argument with producing ano-
ther ab$urdity, that is, that the $ame motions agree to Natures ex-
treamly different; but experience $heweth, that the operations
<marg><I>The diver$ity of
motions helpeth us
in knowing the di-
ver$ity of natures.</I></marg>
and motions of different natures, are different; and Rea$on con-
firmeth the $ame: for otherwi$e we $hould have no way left to
know and di$tingui$h of natures, if they $hould not have their
particular motions and operations, that might guide us to the
knowledge of their $ub$tances.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>238</p>
<P>SAGR. I have twice or thrice ob$erved in the di$cour$es of this
Authour, that to prove that a thing is $o, or $o, he $till alledgeth,
that in that manner it is conformable with our under$tanding; or
that otherwi$e we $hould never be able to conceive of it; or that
the <I>Criterium</I> of Philo$ophy would be overthrown. As if that na-
<marg><I>Nature fir$t
made things as $he
plea$ed, and after-
wards capacitated
mens under$tand-
ings for conceiving

ture had fir$t made mens brains, and then di$po$ed all things in
conformity to the capacity of their intellects. But I incline rather
to think that Nature fir$t made the things them$elves, as $he be$t
liked, and afterwards framed the rea$on of men capable of con-
ceiving (though not without great pains) $ome part of her $e-
crets.</P>
<P>SALV. I am of the $ame opinion. But tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I>
which are the$e different natures, to which, contrary to expe-
rience and rea$on, <I>Copernicus</I> a$$ignes the $ame motions and ope-
rations.</P>
<P>SIMP. They are the$e. The Water, the Air, (which doubt-
le$$e are Natures different from the Earth) and all things that
are in tho$e elements compri$ed, $hall each of them have tho$e
three motions, which <I>Copernicus</I> pretends to be in the Terre$triall
Globe; and my Authour proceedeth to demon$trate Geometri-
<marg>Copernicus <I>er-
roneou$ly a$$igneth
the $ame operations
to different natures</I></marg>
cally, that, according to the <I>Copernican</I> Doctrine, a cloud that is
$u$pended in the Air, and that hangeth a long time over our
heads without changing place, mu$t of nece$$ity have all tho$e three
motions that belong to the Terre$trial Globe. The demon$tra-
tion is this, which you may read your $elf, for I cannot repeat it
without book.</P>
<P>SALV. I $hall not $tand reading of it, nay I think it an imper-
tinency in him to have in$erted it, for I am certain, that no
<I>Copernican</I> will deny the $ame. Therefore admitting him what he
would demon$trate, let us $peak to the objection, which in my
judgment hath no great $trength to conclude any thing contrary
to the <I>Copernican Hypothe$is,</I> $eeing that it derogates nothing from
tho$e motions, and tho$e operations, whereby we come to the
knowledge of the natures, &amp;c. An$wer me, I pray you, <I>Simplici-
us:</I> Tho$e accidents wherein $ome things exactly concur, can
they $erve to inform us of the different natures of tho$e things?</P>
<marg><I>From commune
accidents one can-
not know different
natures.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. No Sir: nay rather the contrary, for from the idendity
of operations and of accidents nothing can be inferred, but an
idendity of natures.</P>
<P>SALV. So that the different natures of the Water, Earth, Air,
and other things conteined in the$e Elements, is not by you argu-
ed from tho$e operations, wherein all the$e Elements and their af-
fixes agree, but from other operations; is it $o?</P>
<P>SIMP. The very $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. So that he who $hould leave in the Elements all tho$e
<foot>motions,</foot>
<p n=>239</p>
motions, operations, and other accidents, by which their natures
are di$tingui$hed, would not deprive us of the power of coming
to the knowledge of them; although he $hould remove tho$e o-
perations, in which they unitedly concur, and which for that rea$on
are of no u$e for the di$tingui$hing of tho$e natures.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think your di$$ertation to be very good.</P>
<P>SALV. But that the Earth, Water, Air, are of a nature equally
con$tituted immoveable about the centre, is it not the opinion of
your $elf, <I>Ari$totle, Prolomy,</I> and all their $ectators?</P>
<P>SIMP. Its on all hands granted as an undeniable truth.</P>
<P>SALV. Then from this common natural condition of quie$-
cence about the centre, there is no argument drawn of the different
natures of the$e Elements, and things elementary, but that
knowledge mu$t be collected from other qualities not common;
and therefore who$o $hould deprive the Elements of this common
re$t only, and $hould leave unto them all their other operations,
would not in the lea$t block up the way that leadeth to the know-
ledge of their e$$ences. But <I>Copernicus</I> depriveth them onely of
this common re$t, and changeth the $ame into a common motion,
leaving them gravity, levity, the motions upwards, downwards,
<marg><I>The concurrence
of the Elements in

$lower, fa$ter, rarity, den$ity, the qualities of hot, cold, dry, moi$t,
and in a word, all things be$ides. Therefore $uch an ab$urdity, as
this Authour imagineth to him$elf, is no <I>Copernican</I> po$ition; nor
doth the concurrence in an identity of motion import any more or
le$s, than the concurrence in an identity of re$t about the diver$i-
fying, or not diver$ifying of natures. Now tell us, if there be any
argument to the contrary.</P>
<P>SIMP. There followeth a fourth objection, taken from a natu-
<marg><I>A fourth argu-
ment again$t</I> Co-

ral ob$ervation, which is, <I>That bodies of the $ame kind, have mo-
tions that agree in kinde, or el$e they agree in re$t. But by the</I> Co-
pernican Hypothe$is, <I>bodies that agree in kinde, and are mo$t $em-</I>
<marg><I>Bodies of the
$ame kinde have
motions that agree
in kinde.</I></marg>
<I>blable to one another, would be very di$crepant, yea diametrically
repugnant as to motion; for that Stars $o like to one another, would
be neverthele$$e $o unlike in motion, as that $ix Planets would perpe-
tually turn round; but the Sun and all the fixeed Stars would $tand
perpetually immoveable.</I></P>
<P>SALV. The forme of the argument appeareth good; but yet
I believe that the application or matter is defective: and if the
Authour will but per$i$t in his a$$umption, the con$equence $hall
make directly again$t him. The Argument runs thus; Among$t
mundane bodies, $ix there are that do perpetually move, and they
<marg><I>From the Earths
ob$curity, and the
$plendour of the
Sun, and fixed
Stars, is argued,
that it is movea-
ble, and they im-
moveable.</I></marg>
are the $ix Planets; of the re$t, that is, of the Earth, Sun, and
fixed Stars, it is di$putable which of them moveth, and which
$tands $till, it being nece$$ary, that if the Earth $tand $till, the Sun
and $ixed Stars do move; and it being al$o po$$ible, that the Sun
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>240</p>
and fixed Stars may $tand immoveable, in ca$e the Earth $hould
move: the matter of fact in di$pute is, to which of them we may
with mo$t convenience a$cribe motion, and to which re$t. Natural
rea$on dictates, that motion ought to be a$$igned to the bodies,
which in kind and e$$ence mo$t agree with tho$e bodies which do
undoubtedly move, and re$t to tho$e which mo$t di$$ent from them;
and in regard that an eternal re$t and perpetual motion are mo$t
different, it is manife$t, that the nature of the body always move-
able ought to be mo$t different from the body alwayes $table.
Therefore, in regard that we are dubious of motion and re$t,
let us enquire, whether by the help of $ome other eminent affecti-
on, we may di$cover, which mo$t agreeth with the bodies certain-
ly moveable, either the Earth, or the Sun and fixed Stars. But $ee
how Nature, in favour of our nece$$ity and de$ire, pre$ents us
with two eminent qualities, and no le$s different than motion and
re$t, and they are light and darkne$s, to wit, the being by nature
mo$t bright, and the being ob$cure, and wholly deprived of light:
the bodies therefore adorned with an internal and eternal $plen-
dour, are mo$t different in e$$ence from tho$e deprived of light:
The Earth is deprived of light, the Sun is mo$t $plendid in it $elf,
and $o are the fixed Stars. The $ix Planets do ab$olutely
want light, as the Earth; therefore their e$$ence agreeth with
the Earth, and differeth from the Sun and fixed Stars. There-
fore is the Earth moveable, immoveable the Sunne and Starry
Sphere.</P>
<P>SIMP. But the Authour will not grant, that the $ix Planets are
tenebro$e, and by that negative will he abide. Or he will argue
the great conformity of nature between the $ix Planets, and the
Sun, and Fixed Stars; and the di$parity between them and the
Earth from other conditions than from tenebro$ity and light; yea,
now I remember in the fifth objection, which followeth, he layeth
down the va$t difference between the Earth and the C&oelig;le$tial

<P>But how much properer a di$tribution, and more with nature,
yea with God him$elf, the Architect, is it, to $eque$ter the pure
<foot>from</foot>

teach; which tell us that the$e impure and frail matters are con-
teined within the angu$t concave of the Lunar Orb, above which
with uninterrupted Series the things Cele$tial di$tend them$elves.</P>
<P>SALV. It's true that the Copernican Sy$teme introduceth di-
<marg>Copernicus <I>in
troduceth confu$ion
in the Univer$e of</I>
Ari$totle.</marg>
$traction in the univer$e of <I>Aristotle</I>; but we $peak of our own
Univer$e, that is true and real. Again if this Author will infer
the di$parity of e$$ence between the Earth and Cele$tial bodies
from the incorruptibility of them, and the corruptibility of it in
the method of <I>Ari$totle,</I> from which di$parity he concludeth mo-
tion to belong to the Sun and fixed Stars, and the immobility of
the Earth, he will flatter him$elf with a Paralogi$me, $uppo$ing
<marg><I>The Paralogi$me
of the Author of
Anti-Tycho.</I></marg>
that which is in que$tion; for <I>Ari$totle</I> inferreth the incorruptibi-
lity of Cele$tial bodies from motion, which is in di$pute, whe-
ther it belongeth to them or to the Earth. Of the vanity of the$e
Rhetorical Illations enough hath been $poken. And what can be
<marg><I>It $eemeth a
folly to affirm the
Earth to be with-
out the Heavens.</I></marg>
more fond, than to $ay, that the Earth and Elements are bani-
$hed and $eque$tred from the Cele$tial Spheres, and confined
within the Lunar Orb? Is, not then the Moons Orb one of the
Cele$tial Spheres, and according to con$ent compri$ed in the
middle of all the re$t? Its a new way to $eparate the pure from
the impure, and the $ick from the $ound, to a$$igne the infected
quarters in the heart of the City: I had thought that the ^{*} Pe$t-
<marg>* Lazeretto</marg>
hou$e ought to have been removed as far off as was po$$ible.
<I>Copernicus</I> admireth the di$po$ition of the parts of the Univer$e,
for that God hath con$tituted the grand Lamp, which is to give
light all over his Temple in the centre of it, and not on one
$ide. And as to the Earths being betwixt <I>Venus</I> and <I>Mars,</I>
we will but hint the $ame; and do you, in favour of this Author,
trie to remove it thence. But let us not ^{*} mix the$e Rhetorical

Flowers with $olid Demon$trations, rather let us leave them to
the Orators, or if you will to the Poets, who know how in their
drolling way to exalt by their pray$es things mo$t $ordid, yea and
$ometimes mo$t pernicious. And if any thing el$e remain, let us
di$patch it, as we have done the re$t.</P>

though their moli-

keth it a very improbale thing. [<I>That a corruptible and di$$ipable
body $hould move with a perpetual and regular motion; and this
he confirmeth with the example of living creatures, which moving
with a motion natural to them, yet grow weary, and have need of
repo$e to re$tore their $trength.</I>] But what hath this motion to do
with that of the Earth, that in compari$on to theirs is immen$e?
Be$ides, to make it move with three motions that run and draw
$everal wayes: Who would ever a$$ert $uch Paradoxes, unle$$e
he had $worn to be their defender? Nor doth that avail in this
<foot>H h ca$e,</foot>
<p n=>242</p>
ca$e, which <I>Copernicus</I> alledgeth, that by rea$on this motion is
natural to the Earth and not violent, it worketh contrary effects
to violent motions; and that tho$e things di$$olve and cannot
long $ub$i$t, to which impul$e is conferred, but tho$e $o made
by nature do continue in their perfect di$po$ure; this an$wer $uf-
ficeth not, I $ay, for it is overthrown by that of ours. For the a-
nimal is a natural body, and not made by art, and its motion is
natural, deriving it $elf from the $oul, that is, from an intrin$ick
principle; and that motion is violent, who$e beginning is with-
out, and on which the thing moved conferreth nothing; how-
ever, if the animal continueth its motion any long time, it grows
weary, and al$o dyeth, if it ob$tinately $trive to per$i$t therein.
You $ee then that in nature we meet on all $ides with notions con-
trary to the <I>Copernican Hypothe$is,</I> and none in favour of it. And
for that I have nothing more wherein to take the part of this Op-

qui auget motum fixarum immen$&agrave; velocitate.</I> [Which makes this
Engli$h.] Its harder to $tretch the accident beyond the model of the
$ubject than to augment the $ubject without the accident. <I>Coperni-</I>
hath more probability on his $ide, who encrea$eth the Orb of the
fixed Stars without motion, than <I>Ptolomy</I> who augmenteth the
motion of the fixed Stars to an immen$e degree of velocity.
<marg><I>The Author of
the Anti Tycho op-
po$eth</I> Kepler.</marg>
Which objection the Author an$wereth, wondering how much
<I>Kepler</I> deceived him$elf, in $aying, that in the Ptolomaick Hypothe-
$is the motion encrea$eth beyond the model of the $ubject, for in
his judgment it doth not encrea$e, $ave onely in conformity to the
model, and that according to its encrea$ement, the velocity of
<marg><I>The velocity of
the circular moti-
on increa$eth, ac-
cording to the en-
crea$e of the dia-
meter of the circle.</I></marg>
the motion is augmented. Which he proveth by $uppo$ing a ma-
chine to be framed, that maketh one revolution in twenty four
hours, which motion $hall be called mo$t $low; afterwards $up-
po$ing its $emidiameter to be prolonged, as far as to the di$tance
of the Sun, its extreme will equal the velocity of the Sun; and
it being cantinued out unto the Starry Sphere, it will equal the
velocity of the fixed Stars, though in the circumferrnce of the
machine it be very $low. Now applying this con$ideration of the
machine to the Starry Sphere, let us imagine any point in its $e-
midiameter, as neer to the centre as is the $emidiameter of the ma-
chine; the $ame motion that in the Starry Sphere is exceeding
<foot>$wift,</foot>
<p n=>243</p>
$wift, $hall in that point be exceeding $low; But the great mag-
nitude of the body is that which maketh it of exceeding $low, to
become exceeding $wift, although it continueth $till the $ame, and
thus the velocity encrea$eth, not beyond the model of the $ub-
ject, but rather according to it, and to its magnitude; very dif-
ferently from the imagination of <I>Kepler.</I></P>
<P>SALV. I do not believe that this Author hath entertained $o
mean and poor a conceit of <I>Kepler,</I> as to per$wade him$elf that
he did not under$tand, that the highe$t term of a line drawn from
the centre unro the Starry Sphere, moveth more $wiftly than a
point of the $ame line taken within a yard or two of the centre. And
therefore of nece$$ity he mu$t have conceived and comprehend-
<marg><I>An explanation
of the true $en$e of</I>
Kepler <I>and his de-
fence.</I></marg>
ed that the mind and intention of <I>Kepler</I> was to have $aid, that
it is le$$e inconvenient to encrea$e an immoveable body to an ex-
traordinary magnitude, than to a$cribe an extraordinary velocity
to a body, though very bigge, having regard to the model,
that is to the gauge, and to the example of other natural bodies;
in which we $ee, that the di$tance from the centre encrea$ing, the
velocity dimini$heth; that is, that the periods of their circulati-
ons take up longer times. But in re$t which is not capable of aug-
<marg><I>The greatne$$e
and $malne$$e of
the body make a
difference in moti-
on and not in re$t.</I></marg>
mentation or diminution, the grandure or $malne$$e of the body
maketh no differeuce. So that if the an$wer of the Author would
be directed again$t the argument of <I>Kepler,</I> it is nece$$ary, that
that Author doth hold, that to the movent principle its one and the
$ame to move in the $ame time a body very $mall, or very im-
men$e, in regard that the augmentation of velocity in$eparably
attends the augmentation of the ma$$e. But this again is contrary
<marg><I>The order of na-
ture is to make the
le$$er Orbs to cir-
culate in $horter
times, and the big-
ger in longer times.</I></marg>
to the Architectonical rule of nature, which doth in the le$$er
Spheres, as we $ee in the Planets, and mo$t $en$ibly in the Medi-
cean Stars, ob$erve to make the le$$er Orbs to circulate in $horter
times: Whence the time of <I>Saturns</I> revolution is longer than all
the times of the other le$$er Spheres, it being thirty years; now
the pa$$ing from this to a Sphere very much bigger, and to make
it move in 24. hours, may very well be $aid to exceed the rules of
the model. So that if we would but attentively con$ider it, the
Authors an$wer oppo$eth not the intent and $en$e of the argument,
but the expre$$ing and manner of delivering of it; where again
the Author is injurious, and cannot deny but that he artificially
di$$embled his under$tanding of the words, that he might charge
<I>Kepler</I> with gro$$e ignorance; but the impo$ture was $o very dull
and obvions, that he could not with all his craft alter the opini-
on which <I>Kepler</I> hath begot of his Doctrine in the minds of all
the Learned. As in the next place, to the in$tance again$t the
perpetual motion of the Earth, taken from the impo$$ibility of
its moving long without wearine$$e, in regard that living crea-
<foot>Hh 2 tures</foot>
<p n=>244</p>
tures them$elves, which yet move naturally, and from an intern
principle, do grow weary, and have need of re$t to relax and re-
fre$h their members --------</P>
<P>SAGR. Methinks I hear <I>Kepler</I> an$wer him to that, that
there are $ome kinde of animals which refre$h them$elves after
wearine$$e, by rowling on the Earth; and that therefore there
<marg><I>The feigned an-
$wer of</I> Kepler <I>co-
vered with an ar-
tificial Irony.</I></marg>
is no need to fear that the Terre$trial Globe $hould tire, nay it
may be rea$onably affirmed, that it enjoyeth a perpetual &amp; mo$t
tranquil repo$e, keeping it $elf in an eternal rowling.</P>
<P>SALV. You are too tart and Satyrical, <I>Sagredus:</I> but let us
lay a$ide je$ts, whil$t we are treating of $erious things.</P>
<P>SAGR. Excu$e me, <I>Salviatus,</I> this that I $ay is not $o ab$o-
lutely be$ides the bu$ine$s, as you perhaps make it; for a motion
that $erveth in$tead of re$t, and removeth wearine$s from a body
tired with travail, may much more ea$ily $erve to prevent the co-
<marg><I>Animals would
not grow weary of
their motion, pro-
ceeding as that
which is a$$igned
to the terre$trial
Globe.</I></marg>
ming of that wearine$s, like as preventive remedies are more ea$ie
than curative. And I hold for certain, that if the motion of ani-
mals $hould proceed in the $ame manner as this that is a$cribed to
the Earth, they would never grow weary; Seeing that the weari-
ne$s of the living creature, deriveth it $elf, in my opinion, from
<marg><I>The cau$e of the
wearine$$e of ani-
mals.</I></marg>
the imployment of but one part alone in the moving of its $elf,
and all the re$t of the body; as <I>v. g.</I> in walking, the thighs and
the legs onely are imployed for carrying them$elves and all the
re$t: on the contrary, you $ee the motion of the heart to be as it
were indefatigable, becau$e it moveth it $elf alone. Be$ides, I
<marg><I>The motion of
an animal is rather
to be called violent
than natural.</I></marg>
know not how true it may be, that the motion of the animal is na-
tural, and not rather violent: nay, I believe that one may truly
$ay, that the $oul naturally moveth the members of an animal with
a motion preternatural, for if the motion upwards is preternatu-
ral to grave bodies, the lifting up of the legs, and the thighs,
which are grave bodies, in walking, cannot be done without vio-
lence, and therefore not without labour to the mover. The
climbing upwards by a ladder carrieth the grave body contrary to
its natural inclination upwards, from whence followeth wearine$s,
by rea$on of the bodies natural aver$ne$s to that motion: but in
moving a moveable with a motion, to which it hath no aver$ion,
<marg><I>The $trength di-
mini$heth not,
where it is not im-
ployed.</I></marg>
what la$$itude, what diminution of vertue and $trength need we
fear in the mover? and how $hould the forces wa$te, where they
are not at all imployed?</P>
<P>SIMP. They are the contrary motions wherewith the Earth is
pretended to move, again$t which the Authour produceth his ar-
gument.</P>
<P>SAGR. It hath been $aid already, that they are no wi$e con-
traries, and that herein the Authour is extteamly deceived, $o
that the whole $trength of the argument recoileth upon the Op-
<foot>ponent</foot>
<p n=>245</p>
ponent him$elf, whil$t he will make the <I>Fir$t Mover</I> to hurry
<marg><I>The argument
of</I> Cla<*>ntius,
<I>recoileth upon him-
$elf.</I></marg>
along with it all the inferiour Spheres, contrary to the motion
which they them$elves at the $ame time exerci$e. It belongs there-
fore to the <I>Primum Mobile</I> to grow weary, which be$ides the
moving of its $elf is made to carry $o many other Spheres, and
which al$o $trive again$t it with a contrary motion. So that
the ultimate conclu$ion that the Authour inferred, $aying, that
di$cour$ing of the effects of Nature, a man alwayes meets with
things that favour the opinion of <I>Ari$toile</I> and <I>Ptolomy,</I> and ne-
ver any one that doth not interfer with <I>Copernicus,</I> $tands in need
of great con$ideration; and it is better to $ay, that one of the$e
two <I>Hypothe$es</I> being true, and the other nece$$arily fal$e, it is
impo$$ible that a man $hould ever be able to finde any argu-
ment, experience, or right rea$on, in favour of that which is
<marg><I>True Propo$iti-
ons meet with ma-
ny conclu$ive ar-
guments, $o do not
the fal$e.</I></marg>
fal$e, like as to the truth none of the$e things can be repugnant.
Va$t difference, therefore, mu$t needs be found between the rea-
$ons and arguments produced by the one and other party, for and
again$t the$e two opinions, the force of which I leave you your
$elf to judge of, <I>Simplicius.</I></P>
<P>SALV. But you, <I>Sagredus,</I> being tran$ported by the velocity
of your wit, have taken my words out of my mouth, whil$t I was
about to $ay $omething, touching this la$t argument of the Author;
and although you have more then $ufficiently refuted him, yet
neverthele$$e I will adde $omewhat, which then ran in my minde.
He propo$eth it as a thing very unlikely, that a body di$$ipable
and corruptible, as the Earth, $hould perpetually move with a re-
gular motion, c$pecially for that we $ee living creatures in the end
to grow weary, and to $tand in need of re$t: and the improbability
is increa$ed, in that the $aid motion is required to be of velocity
incomparable and immen$e, in re$pect to that of animals. Now, I
cannot $ee why the velocity of the Earth $hould, at pre$ent, trou-
ble it; $o long as that of the $tarry Sphere $o very much bigger
doth not occa$ion in it any di$turbance more con$iderable, than that
which the velocity of a machine, that in 24 hours maketh but one
$ole revolution, produceth in the $ame. If the being of the velo-
city of the Earths conver$ion, according to the model of that ma-
chine, inferreth things of no greater moment than that, let the Au-
thor cea$e to fear the Earths growing weary; for that not one of
the mo$t feeble and $low-pac't animals, no not a Cham&aelig;leon would
<marg>* Cinque &ograve; $ei
braccia Fiorentini.</marg>
tire in moving no more than ^{*} four or five yards in 24 hours; but
if he plea$e to con$ider the velocity to be no longer, in relation to
<marg><I>Wearine&szlig; more
to be feared in the
$tarry Sphere than
in the terre$triall
Globe.</I></marg>
the model of the machine, but ab$olutely, and ina$much as the
moveable in 24 hours is to pa$s a very great $pace, he ought to $hew
him$elf $o much more re$erved in granting it to the $tarry Sphere,
which with a velocity incomparably greater than that of the
<foot>Earth</foot>
<p n=>246</p>
Earth is to carry along with it a thou$and bodies, each much big-
ger than the Terre$trial Globe.</P>
<P>Here it remains for us to $ee the proofs, whereby the Authour
concludes the new $tars <I>Anno</I> 1572. and <I>Anno</I> 1604. to be $ublu-
nary, and not c&oelig;le$tial, as the <I>Astronomers</I> of tho$e times were
generally per$waded; an enterprize very great certainly; but I
have con$idered, that it will be better, in regard the Book is new
and long, by rea$on of its many calculations, that between this e-
vening and to morrow morning I make them as plain as I can, and
$o meeting you again to morrow to continue our wonted confe-
rences, give you a brief of what I $hall ob$erve therein; and if we
have time left, we will $ay $omething of the <I>Annual motion</I> a$cri-
bed to the Earth. In the mean time, if either of you, and <I>Simpli-
cius</I> in particular, hath any thing to $ay more, touching what relates
to the <I>Diurnal motion,</I> at large examined by me, we have a little
time $till left to treat thereof.</P>
<P>SIMP. I have no more to $ay, unle$$e it be this, that the di$cour-
$es that this day have falne under our debate, have appeared to me
fraught with very acute and ingenious notions, alledged on <I>Coper-
nicus</I> his $ide, in confirmation of the motion of the Earth, but yet
I find not my $elf per$waded to believe it; for in $hort, the things
that have been $aid conclude no more but this, that the rea$ons
for the $tability of the Earth are not nece$$ary; but all the while
no demon$tration hath been produced on the other $ide, that doth
nece$$arily convince and prove its mobility.</P>
<P>SALV. I never undertook, <I>Simplicius,</I> to remove you from that
your opinion; much le$s dare I pre$ume to determine definitively
in this controver$ie: it onely was, and $till $hall be in the en$uing
di$putations my intent, to make it appear to you, that tho$e who
have thought that mo$t $wift motion of 24 hours doth belong to
the Earth alone, and not to the Univer$e, the Earth onely exclu-
ded, were not induced to believe, that $o it might and ought to do
out of any blind per$wa$ion; but that they did very well $ee, try,
and examine the rea$ons on the contrary $ide, and al$o not $light-
ly an$wer them. With the $ame intention, if it $tand with your
liking, and that of <I>Sagredus,</I> we may pa$$e to the con$ideration of
that other motion; fir$t, by <I>Aristarchus Samius,</I> and afterwards
by <I>Nicholaus Copernicus</I> a$cribed to the $aid Terre$trial Globe,
which is, as, I believe, you have heretofore heard, made under the
Zodiack within the $pace of a year about the Sun, immoveably
placed in the centre of the $aid Zodiack.</P>
<P>SIMP. The di$qui$ition is $o great, and $o noble, that I $hall
gladly hearken to the di$cu$$ion thereof, per$wading my $elf that I
$hall hear what ever can be $aid of that matter. And I will after-
<foot>wards</foot>

wards by my $elf, according to my u$ual cu$tome, make more de-
liberate reflexions upon what hath been, and is to be $poken; and
if I $hould gain no more but this, it will be no $mall benefit
that I $hall be able to di$cour$e more Logically.</P>
<P>SAGR. Therefore, that we may no further weary <I>Salviatus,</I>
we will put a period to the di$putations of this day, and re-
a$$ume our conference to morrow in the u$ual manner, with hope
to hear very plea$ing novelties.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will leave with you the Book <I>De $tellis novis,</I> and car-
ry back this of the Conclu$ions, to $ee what is written therein a-

<P>SAGR. The great de$ire wherewith I have expected
your coming, that I might hear the novel
conceits touching the annual conver$i-
on of this our Globe, hath made me
think the houres of the la$t night, and
tho$e of this morning very tedious, al-
though I $pent them not idly, but lying
awake I imployed a good part thereof in
ruminating upon our ye$terdayes di$cour-
$es, weighing the rea$ons alledged by both parties, in favour of
the two contrary Hypothe$es, that of <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy,</I> and
this of <I>Ari$tarchus,</I> and <I>Copernicus.</I> And really methinks, that
which ever of the$e parties have been deceived, they are worthy of
excu$e, $o $pecious and valid in appearance are the rea$ons that
may have per$waded them either way; though neverthele$$e we
<foot>Ii do</foot>
<p n=>250</p>
do for the mo$t part clo$e with tho$e produced by the grave Au-
thours fir$t above mentioned. But albeit that the <I>Peripatetick Hy-
pothe$is,</I> by rea$on of its antiquity, hath had many followers and
fautors, and the other very few; fir$t, for its ob$curity, and next,
for its novelty, yet methinks I di$cover among$t tho$e many,
and particularly among$t the modernes $ome, who for the $up-
port of the opinion by them e$teemed true, have introduced
other rea$ons $ufficiently childi$h, I could $ay ridiculous.</P>
<P>SALV. I have met with the like, and $o much wor$e than
<marg><I>Some in arguing
fir$t fix in their
minds the conclu-
$ion beleeved by
them, and then a-
dapt their rea$ons
to that.</I></marg>
yours, that I blu$h to rehear$e them, not $o much to $pare the fame
of their Authours, the names of whom might be perpetually con-
cealed, as becau$e I am a$hamed $o much to $tain the honour of
mankinde. In ob$erving of the$e men, I have found that $ome
there are who prepo$terou$ly rea$oning, fir$t $tabli$h the conclu-
$ion in their fancy, and (either becau$e it is their own, or el$e be-
longs to a per$on whom they much confide in) $o firmly imprint
it in their opinions, that it is altogether impo$$ible ever wholly to
efface it: and tho$e rea$ons which they them$elves $tumble upon,
or which they hear others to alledge in confirmation of the con-
ceit entertained, though never $o $imple and in$ipid, in$tantly find
credit and applau$e with them: but on the contrary, tho$e which
are brought again$t their opinion, though ingenuous and conclu-
ding, they receive not only with nau$eating, but with di$dain and
bitter indignation, yea, you $hall have one of the$e $o inraged, as
that he will not be backward to try all wayes to $uppre$s and $ilence
their adver$aries: and of this I my $elf have had $ome experience.</P>
<P>SAGR. Indeed the$e men deduce not the conclu$ion from the
premi$es, nor confirme them with rea$ons, but accomodate, or to
$ay better, di$commodate and di$tort the premi$es and arguments
to make them $peak in favour of their pre-a$$umed and pertinaci-
ous conclu$ions. It is not good therefore to contract familiarity
with the$e men; and the rather, for that their conver$ation is not
only unplea$ant, but al$o dangerous. Yet let us continue our con-
ference with <I>Simplicius</I> however, whom I have known this long
while for a man of great ingenuity, and altogether void of malice:
be$ides he is well ver$t in the Peripatetick Doctrine; $o that I may
a$$ure my $elf, that what $hall not fall within the reach of his rea-
$on for the $upport of the <I>Ari$totelian</I> Hypothe$is, will not ea$ily
be found out by others. But $ee yonder he comes, quite out of
winde, who$e company we have $o long de$ired: we were ju$t now
$peaking again$t the $mall ha$t you made to come to us.</P>
<P>SIMP. You mu$t not blame me, but <I>Neptune,</I> for this my long
$tay; which in the ebbe of this mornings tide hath in a manner
drain'd away the waters, for the <I>Gondola</I> that brought me, being
entered not far from hence into a certain Channel, wanting depth,
<foot>where</foot>
<p n=>251</p>
where I was $tranded, and forced to $tay there more than a full
hour, in expecting the return of the tide: and there waiting in
this manner, without being able to get out of the boat, which on a
$udden ran a ground, I ob$erved a certain accident, which to me
<marg><I>The motion of
the water in ebbing
and flowing not in-
terrupted by re$t.</I></marg>
$eemed very $trange; and it was this, that in the waters ebbing
I $aw it retreat very fa$t by $everal $mall rivolets, the ouze being
in many places di$covered, and whil$t I $tood looking upon this ef-
fect, I $aw this motion in an in$tant to cea$e, and without a mi-
nutes interval the $ame water to begin to return back again, and
the tide from ebbing to become young flood, without $tanding
$till a moment: an effect that as long as I have dwelt in <I>Venice,</I>
I never took notice of before.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is very much, that you $hould be left thus on ground,
among$t $mall Channels; in which rivolets, as having very little
declivity, the ri$ing or falling of the main $ea, the thickne$s onely
of a paper is $ufficient to make the water to ebbe and flow for good
long $paces of time: like as in $ome creeks of the Sea, its flowing
four or $ix ^{*} yards onely, maketh the water to overflow the adja-
cent Mar$hes for $ome hundreds and thou$ands of ^{*} acres.</P>
<marg>* Pertiche vene-
tiani.</marg>
<P>SIMP. This I know very well, but I $hould have thought, that
between the ultimate terme of ebbing, and the fir$t beginnng to
flow, there $hould have interpo$ed $ome con$iderable interval of
re$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. This will appear unto you, if you ca$t your eye upon
the bank or piles, where the$e mutations are made perpendicular-
ly, but not that there is any real time of ce$$ation.</P>
<P>SIMP. I did think, that becau$e the$e two motions were con-
trary, there ought to be in the mid$t between them $ome kind of
re$t; conformable to the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I> which demon$trates.
that <I>in puncto regre$$us mediat quies.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. I very well remember this place: but I bear in minde
al$o, that when I read Philo$ophy, I was not thorowly $atisfied
with <I>Ari$totles</I> demon$tration; but that I had many experiments
on the contrary, which I could $till rehear$e unto you, but I am
unwilling to $ally out into any other digre$$ions, we being met
here to di$cour$e of the propo$ed mattes, if it be po$$ible, without
the$e excur$ions wherewith we have interrupted our di$putes in
tho$e dayes that are pa$t.</P>
<P>SIMP. And yet we may with convenience, if not interrupt
them, at lea$t prolong them very much, for returning ye$ter-
day home, I $et my $el$ to read the Tractate of Conclu$ions, where
I find Demon$trations again$t this annual motion a$cribed to the
Earth, very $olid; and becau$e I would not tru$t my memory with
the punctual relation of them, I have brought back the Book a-
long with me.</P>
<foot>Ii 2 SAGR</foot>
<p n=>252</p>
<P>SAGR. You have done very well; but if we would re-a$$ume
our Di$putations according to ye$terdayes appointment, it is re-
qui$ite that we fir$t hear what account <I>Salviatus</I> hath to give us
of the Book, <I>De $tellis novis,</I> and then without interruption we
may proceed to the Annual motion. Now what $ay you, <I>Salvia-
tus</I> touching tho$e $tars? Are they really pull'd down from Hea-
ven to the$e lower regions, by vertue of that Authours calculati-
ons, whom <I>Simplicius</I> mentioneth?</P>
<P>SALV. I $et my $elf la$t night to peru$e his proceedings, and I
have this morning had another view of him, to $ee whether that
which he $eemed over night to affirm, were really his $en$e, or my
dreams and phanta$tical nocturnal imaginations; and in the clo$e
found to my great grief that tho$e things were really written and
printed, which for the reputation-$ake of this Philo$opher I was
unwilling to believe. It is in my judgment impo$$ible, but that he
$hould perceive the vanity of his undertaking, a$well becau$e it is
too apert, as becau$e I remember, that I have heard him mentio-
ned with applau$e by the <I>Academick our Friend</I>: it $eemeth to
me al$o to be a thing very unlikely, that in complacency to others,
he $hould be induced to $et $o low a value upon his reputation, as
to give con$ent to the publication of a work, for which he could
expect no other than the cen$ure of the Learned.</P>
<P>SAGR. Yea, but you know, that tho$e will be much fewer
than one for an hundred, compared to tho$e that $hall celebrate
and extoll him above the greate$t wits that are, or ever have been
in the world: He is one that hath mentioned the Peripate-
tick inalterability of Heaven again$t a troop of <I>A$tronomers,</I> and
that to their greater di$grace hath foiled them at their own wea-
pons; and what do you think four or five in a Countrey that di$-
cern his triflings, can do again$t the innumerable multitude, that,
not being able to di$cover or comprehend them, $uffer them$elves
to be taken with words, and $o much more applaud him, by how
much the le$$e they under$tand him? You may adde al$o, that
tho$e few who under$tand, $corn to give an an$wer to papers $o
trivial and unconcludent; and that upon very good rea$ons, be-
cau$e to the intelligent there is no need thereof, and to tho$e that

<P>SALV. The mo$t de$erved puni$hment of their demerits would
certainly be $ilence, if there were not other rea$ons, for which it
is haply no le$$e than nece$$ary to re$ent their timerity: one of
which is, that we <I>Italians</I> thereby incur the cen$ure of Illiterates,
and attract the laughter of Forreigners; and e$pecially to $uch
who are $eparated from our Religion; and I could $hew you ma-
ny of tho$e of no $mall eminency, who $coff at our <I>Academick,</I>
and the many Mathematicians that are in <I>Italie,</I> for $uffering the
<foot>follies</foot>
<p n=>253</p>
follies of $uch a ^{*} Fabler again$t <I>A$tronomers</I> to come into the

light, and to be openly maintained without contradiction; but
this al$o might be di$pen$ed with, in re$pect of the other greater
occa$ions of laughter, wherewith we may confront them depend-
ing on the di$$imulation of the intelligent, touching the follies of
the$e opponents of the Doctrines that they well enough under-
$tand.</P>
<P>SAGR. I de$ire not a greater proof of tho$e mens petulancy,
and the infelicity of a <I>Copernican,</I> $ubject to be oppo$ed by $uch
as under$tand not $o much as the very fir$t po$itions, upon which
he undertakes the quarrel.</P>
<P>SALV. You will be no le$$e a$toni$hed at their method in con-
futing the <I>Astronomers,</I> who affirm the new Stars to be $uperiour
to the Orbs of the Planets; and peradventure in the ^{&dagger;} Firmament
<marg>&dagger; He taketh the
Firmament for the
Starry Sphere, and
as we vulgarly re-
ceive the word.</marg>
it $elf.</P>
<P>SAGR. But how could you in $o $hort a time examine all this
Book, which is $o great a Volume, and mu$t needs contain very
many demon$trations.?</P>
<P>SALV. I have confined my $elf to the$e his fir$t confutations, in
which with twelve demon$trations founded upon the ob$ervations
of twelve <I>A$tronomers,</I> (who all held, that the Star, <I>Anno</I> 1572.
which appeared in <I>Ca$$iopeia,</I> was in the Firmament) he proveth it
on the contrary, to be beneath the Moon, conferring, two by two,
the meridian altitudes, proceeding in the method that you $hall
under$tand by and by. And becau$e, I think, that in the exami-
nation of this his fir$t progre$$ion, I have di$covered in this Au-
thour a great unlikelihood of his ability to conclude any thing a-
gain$t the <I>A$tronomers,</I> in favour of the <I>Peripatetick Philo$ophers,</I>
and that their opinion is more and more concludently confirmed,
I could not apply my $elf with the like patience in examining his
other methods, but have given a very $light glance upon them,
and am certain, that the defect that is in the$e fir$t impugnations,
is likewi$e in the re$t. And as you $hall $ee, by experience, very
few words will $uffice to confute this whole Book, though compi-
led with $o great a number of laborious calculations, as here you
<marg><I>The method ob-
$erved by</I> Clar. <I>in
confuting the A-
$tronomers, and by</I>
Salviatus <I>in confu-
ting him.</I></marg>
$ee. Therefore ob$erve my proceedings. This Authour under-
taketh, as I $ay, to wound his adver$aries with their own weapons,
<I>i.e.</I> a great number of ob$ervations made by them$elves, to wit, by
twelve or thirteen Authours in number, and upon part of them he
makes his $upputations, and concludeth tho$e $tars to have been
below the Moon. Now becau$e the proceeding by interrogato-
ries very much plea$eth me, in regard the Authour him$elf is not
here, let <I>Simplicius</I> an$wer me to the que$tions that I $hall ask
him, as he thinks he him$elf would, if he were pre$ent. And pre-
$uppo$ing that we $peak of the fore$aid Star, of <I>Anno</I> 1572. ap-
<foot>pearing</foot>
<p n=>254</p>
pearing in <I>Ca$$iopeia,</I> tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> whether you believe that
it might be in the $ame time placed in divers places, that is, a-
mong$t the Elements, aud al$o among$t the planetary Orbs, and
al$o above the$e among$t the fixed Stars, and yet again infinitely
more high.</P>
<P>SIMP. There is no doubt, but that it ought to be confe$$ed
that it is but in one only place, and at one $ole and determinate
di$tance from the Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore if the ob$ervations made by the A$trono-
mers were exact, and the calculations made by this Author were
not erroneous, it were ea$ie from all tho$e and all the$e to re-
collect the $ame di$tances alwayes to an hair, is not this true?</P>
<P>SIMP. My rea$on hitherto tells me that $o it mu$t needs be;
nor do I believe that the Author would contradict it</P>
<P>SALV. But when of many and many computations that have
been made, there $hould not be $o much as two onely that prove
true, what would you think of them?</P>
<P>SIMP. I would think that they were all fal$e, either through
the fault of the computi$t, or through the defect of the ob$er-
vators, and at the mo$t that could be $aid, I would $ay, that but
onely one of them and no more was true; but as yet I know not
which to choo$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Would you then from fal$e fundamentals deduce and
e$tabli$h a doubtful conclu$ion for ttue? Certainly no. Now the
calculations of this Author are $uch, that no one of them agrees
with another, you may $ee then what credit is to be given to
them.</P>
<P>SIMP. Indeed, if it be $o, this is a notable failing.</P>
<P>SAGR. But by the way I have a mind to help <I>Simplicius,</I> and
the Author by telling <I>Salviatus,</I> that his arguments would hold
good if the Author had undertook to go about to find out exact-
ly the di$tance of the Star from the Earth, which I do not think
to be his intention; but onely to demon$trate that from tho$e
ob$ervations he collected that the Star was $ublunary. So
that if from tho$e ob$ervations, and from all the computations
made thereon, the height of the Star be alwayes collected to be
le$$e than that of the Moon, it $erves the Authors turn to con-
vince all tho$e A$tronomers of mo$t impardonable ignorance,
that through the defect either of Geometry or Arithmetick, have
not known how to draw true conclu$ions from their own ob$erva-
tions them$elves.</P>
<P>SALV. It will be convenient therefore that I turn my $elf to
you, <I>Sagredus,</I> who $o cunningly aphold the Doctrine of this
Author. And to $ee whether I can make <I>Simplicius,</I> though not
very expert in calcnlations, and demon$trations to apprehend the
<foot>in-</foot>
<p n=>255</p>
inconclu$ivene$$e at lea$t of the demon$trations of this Author,
fir$t propo$ed to con$ideration, and how both he, and all the
A$tronomers with whom he contendeth, do agree that the new
Star had not any motion of its own, and onely went round with
the diurnal motion of the <I>primum mobile</I>; but di$$ent about the
placing of it, the one party putting it in the Cele$tial Region,
that is above the Moon, and haply above the fixed Stars, and
the other judging it to be neer to the Earth, that is, under the
concave of the Lunar Orb. And becau$e the $ituation of the new
$tar, of which we $peak, was towards the North, and at no very
great di$tance from the Pole, $o that to us <I>Septentrionals,</I> it did
never $et, it was an ea$ie matter with A$tronomical in$truments
to have taken its $everal meridian altitudes, as well its $malle$t
under the Pole, as its greate$t above the $ame; from the compa-
ring of which altitudes, made in $everal places of the Earth,
$ituate at different di$tances from the North, that is, different
from one another in relation to polar altitudes, the $tars di$tance
might be inferred: For if it was in the Firmament among$t the
<marg><I>The greate$t and
lea$t elevations of
the new $tar differ
not from each o-
ther more than the
polar allitudes, the
$aid $tar being in
the Firmnment.</I></marg>
other fixed $tars, its meridian altitudes taken in divers elevations
of the pole, ought nece$$arily to differ from each other with the
$ame variations that are found among$t tho$e elevations them-
$elves; that is, for example, if the elevation of the $tar above
the horizon was 30 degrees, taken in the place where the polar
altitude was <I>v. gr.</I> 45 degrees, the elevation of the $ame $tar
ought to have been encrea$ed 4 or 5 degrees in tho$e more Nor-
thernly places where the pole was higher by the $aid 4 or 5 de-
grees. But if the $tars di$tance from the Earth was but very little,
in compari$on of that of the Firmament; its meridian altitudes
ought approaching to the North to encrea$e con$iderably more
than the polar altitudes; and by that greater encrea$e, that is,
by the exce$$e of the encrea$e of the $tars elevation, above the
encrea$e of the polar elevation (which is called the difference of
Parallaxes) is readily calculated with a cleer and $ure method,
the $tars di$tance from the centre of the Earth. Now this Author
taketh the ob$ervations made by thirteen A$tronomers in $undry
elevations of the pole, and conferring a part of them at his plea-
$ure, he computeth by twelve collations the new $tars height to
have been alwayes beneath the Moon; but this he adventures to
do in hopes to find $o gro$$e ignorance in all tho$e, into who$e
hands his book might come, that to $peak the truth, it hath turn'd
my $tomack; and I wait to $ee how tho$e other A$tronomers, and
particularly <I>Kepler,</I> again$t whom this Author principally in-
veigheth, can contein them$elves in $ilence, for he doth not u$e
to hold his tongue on $uch occa$ions; unle$$e he did po$$ibly
think the enterprize too much below him. Now to give you to
<foot>un-</foot>
<p n=>256</p>
under$tand the $ame, I have upon this paper tran$cribed the con-
clu$ions that he inferreth from his twelve indagations; the fir$t of

</table>
<P>The$e are twelve indagations made by the Author at his electi-
on, among$t many which, as he $aith, might be made by combi-
ning the ob$ervations of the$e thirteen ob$ervators. The which
twelve we may believe to be the mo$t favourable to prove his
intention.</P>
<P>SAGR. I would know whether among$t the $o many other in-
dagations pretermitted by the Author, there were not $ome that
made again$t him, that is, from which calculating one might find
the new $tar to have been above the Moon, as at the very fir$t
$ight I think we may rea$onably que$tion; in regard I $ee the$e
already produced to be $o different from one another, that $ome
of them give me the di$tance of the $aid $tar from the Earth, 4, 6,
10, 100, a thou$and, and an hundred thou$and times bigger one
than another; $o that I may well $u$pect that among$t tho$e that
he did not calculate, there was $ome one in fauour of the adver$e
party. And I gue$$e this to be the more probable, for that I can-
not conceive that tho$e A$tronomers the ob$ervators could want
the knowledg and practice of the$e computations, which I think
do not depend upon the ab$truce$t things in the World. And in-
deed it will $eem to me a thing more than miraculous, if whil$t in
the$e twelve inve$tigations onely, there are $ome that make the
$tar to be di$tant from the Earth but a few miles, and others that
make it to be but a very fmall matter below the Moon, there are
none to be found that in favour of the contrary part do make it
$o much as twenty yards above the Lunar Orb. And that which
$hall be yet again more extravagant, that all tho$e A$tronomers
$hould have been $o blind as not to have di$covered that their $o
apparent mi$take.</P>
<P>SALV. Begin now to prepare your ears to hear with infinite
admiration to what exce$$es of confidence of ones own authority
and others folly, the de$ire of contradicting and $hewing ones
$elf wi$er than others, tran$ports a man. Among$t the indaga-
tions omitted by the Author, there are $uch to be found as make
the new $tar not onely above the Moon, but above the fixed
$tars al$o. And the$e are not a few, but the greater part, as you
$hall $ee in this other paper, where I have $et them down.</P>
<P>SAGR. But what $aith the Author to the$e? It may be he did
not think of them?</P>
<P>SALV. He hath thought of them but too much: but $aith, that
the ob$ervations upon which the calculations make the $tar to be
infinitely remote, are erroneous, and that they cannot be com-
bined to one another.</P>
<foot>Kk SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>258</p>
<P>SIMP. But this $eemeth to me a very lame eva$ion; for the ad-
ver$e party may with as much rea$on reply, that tho$e are errone-
ous wherewith he collecteth the $tar to have been in the Elemen-
tary Region.</P>
<P>SALV. Oh <I>Simplicius,</I> if I could but make you comprehend
the craft, though no great craftine$$e of this Author, I $hould
make you to wonder, and al$o to be angry to $ee how that he
palliating his $agacity with the vail of the $implicity of your $elf;
and the re$t of meer Philo$ophers, would in$inuate him$elf into
your good opinion, by tickling your cars, and $welling your am-
bition, pretending to have convinced and $ilenced the$e petty
A$tronomers, who went about to a$$ault the impregnable inalte-
rability of the <I>Peripatetick</I> Heaven, and which is more, to have
foild and conquered them with their own arms. I will try with all
my ability to do the $ame; and in the mean time let <I>Sagredus</I>
take it in good part, if <I>Simplicius</I> and I try his patience, perhaps
a little too much, whil$t that with a $uperfluous circumlocution
($uperfluous I $ay to his mo$t nimble apprehen$ion) I go about to
make out a thing, which it is not convenient $hould be hid and
unknown unto him.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $hall not onely without wearine$$e, but al$o with
much delight hearken to your di$cour$es; and $o ought all <I>Peripa-
tetick</I> Philo$ophers, to the end they may know how much they
are oblieged to this their Protector.</P>
<P>SALV. Tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> whether you do well comprehend,
how, the new $tar being placed in the meridian circle yonder to-
wards the North, the $ame to one that from the South $hould
go towards the North, would $eem to ri$e higher and higher a-
bove the Horizon, as much as the Pole, although it $hould have
been $cituate among$t the fixed $tars; but, that in ca$e it were
con$iderably lower, that is nearer to the Earth, it would appear
to a$cend more than the $aid pole, and $till more by how much
its vicinity was greater?</P>
<P>SIMP. I think that I do very well conceive the $ame; in to-
ken whereof I will try if I can make a mathematical Scheme of
it, and in this great circle <I>[in Fig. 1. of this Dialogue.]</I> I will
marke the pole P; and in the$e two lower circles I will note two
$tars beheld from one place on the Earth, which let be A; and
let the two $tars be the$e B and C, beheld in the $ame line A B C,
which line I prolong till it meet with a fixed $tar in D. And then
walking along the Earth, till I come to the term E, the two
$tars will appear to me $eparated from the fixed $tar D, and ad-
vanced neerer to the pole P, and the lower $tar B more, which
will appear to me in G, and the $tar C le$$e, which will ap
pear to me in F, but the fixed $tar D will have kept the $ame
di$tance from the Pole.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>259</p>
<P>SALV. I $ee that you under$tand the bu$ine$$e very well. I be-
lieve that you do likewi$e comprehend, that, in regard the $tar B
is lower than C, the angle which is made by the rayes of the
$ight, which departing from the two places A and E, meet in C,
to wit, this angle A C E, is more narrow, or if we will $ay more
acute than the angle con$tituted in B, by the rayes A B and
E <I>B.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. This I likewi$e under$tand very well.</P>
<P>SALV. And al$o, the Earth beine very little and almo$t in$en-
$ible, in re$pect of the Firmament <I>(or Starry Sphere</I>;) and con-
$equently the $pace A E, paced on the Earth, being very $mall in
compari$on of the immen$e length of the lines E G and E F, pa$-
$ing from the Earth unto the Firmament, you thereby collect that
the $tar C might ri$e and a$cend $o much and $o much above the
Earth, that the angle therein made by the rayes which depart
from the $aid $tationary points A and E, might become mo$t a-
cute, and as it were ab$olutely null and in$en$ible.</P>
<P>SIMP. And this al$o is mo$t manife$t to $en$e.</P>
<P>SALV. Now you know <I>Simplicius</I> that A$tronomers and Ma-
thematicians have found infallible rules by way of Geometry and
Arithmetick, to be able by help of the quantity of the$e angles
<I>B</I> and C, and of their differences, with the additional knowledg
of the di$tance of the two places A and E, to find to a foot the
remotene$$e of $ublime bodies; provided alwayes that the afore-
$aid di$tance, and angles be exactly taken.</P>
<P>SIMP. So that if the Rules dependent on <I>Geometry</I> and <I>A$tro-
nomy</I> be true, all the fallacies and errours that might be met with
in attempting to inve$tigate tho$e altitudes of new Stars or Co-
mets, or other things mu$t of nece$$ity depend on the di$tance A E,
and on the angles B and C, not well mea$ured. And thus all tho$e
differences which are found in the$e twelve workings depend, not
on the de$ects of the rules of the Calculations, but on the errours
committed in finding out tho$e angles, and tho$e di$tances, by means
of the In$trumental Ob$ervations.</P>
<P>SALV. True; and of this there is no doubt to be made. Now
it is nece$$ary that you ob$erve inten$ely, how in removing the Star
from B to C, whereupon the angle alwayes grows more acute, the
ray E B G goeth farther and farther off from the ray A B D in
the part beneath the angle, as you may $ee in the line E C F,
who$e inferiour part E C is more remote from the part A C, than
is the part E B, but it can never happen, that by any what$oever
immen$e rece$$ion, the lines A D and E F $hould totally $ever from
each other, they being finally to go and conjoyn in the Star: and
onely this may be $aid, that they would $eparate, and reduce them-
$elves to parallels, if $o be the rece$$ion $hould be infinite, which
<foot>Kk 2 ca$e</foot>
<p n=>260</p>
ca$e is not to be $uppo$ed. But becau$e (ob$erve well) the di$tance
of the Firmament, in relation to the $mallne$$e of the Earth, as
hath been $aid, is to be accounted, as if it were infinite; therefore
the angle conteined betwixt the two rayes, that being drawn from
the points A and E, go to determine in a fixed Star, is e$teemed
nothing, and tho$e rayes held to be two parallel lines; and there-
fore it is concluded, that then only may the New Star be affirmed
to have been in the Firmament, when from the collating of the
Ob$ervations made in divers places, the $aid angle is, by calcula-
tion, gathered to be in$en$ible, and the lines, as it were, parallels.
But if the angle be of a con$iderable quantity, the New Star mu$t
of nece$$ity be lower than tho$e fixed; and al$o than the Moon, in
ca$e the angle A B E $hould be greater than that which would be
made in the Moons centre.</P>
<P>SIMP. Then the remotene$$e of the Moon is not $o great, that
a like angle $hould be ^{*}in$en$ible in her?</P>
<marg>* Imperceptible.</marg>
<P>SALV. No Sir; nay it is $en$ible, not onely in the Moon, but
in the Sun al$o.</P>
<P>SIMP. But if this be $o, it's po$$ible that the $aid angle may
be ob$erved in the New Star, without nece$$itating it to be inferi-
our to the Sun, a$well as to the Moon.</P>
<P>SALV. This may very well be, yea, and is in the pre$ent ca$e,
as you $hall $ee in due place; that is, when I $hall have made plain
the way, in $uch manner that you al$o, though not very perfect in
<I>A$tronomical</I> calculations, may clearly $ee, and, as it were, with
your hands feel how that this Authour had it more in his eye to
write in complacency of the <I>Peripateticks,</I> by palliating and di$-
$embling $undry things, than to e$tabli$h the truth, by producing
them with naked $incerity: therefore let us proceed forwards. By
the things hitherto $poken, I $uppo$e that you comprehend very
well how that the di$tance of the new Star can never be
made $o immen$e, that the angle $o often named $hall wholly di$-
appear, and that the two rayes of the Ob$ervators at the places
A and E, $hall become altogether parallels: and you may con$e-
quently comprehend to the full, that if the calculations $hould
collect from the ob$ervations, that that angle was totally null, or
that the lines were truly parallels, we $hould be certain that the
ob$ervations were at lea$t in $ome $mall particular erroneous:
But, if the calculations $hould give us the $aid lines to be $epara-
ted not only to equidi$tance, that is, $o as to be parallel, but to
have pa$t beyond that terme, and to be dilated more above than
below, then mu$t it be re$olutely concluded, that the ob$ervations
were made with le$$e accuratene$$e, and in a word, to be errone-
ous; as leading us to a manife$t impo$$ibility. In the next place,
you mu$t believe me, and $uppo$e it for true, that two right lines
<foot>which</foot>
<p n=>261</p>
which depart from two points marked upon another right line, are
then wider above than below, when the angles included between
them upon that right line are greater than two right angles; and
if the$e angles $hould be equal to two right angles, the lines would
be parallels; but if they were le$s than two right angles, the lines
would be concurrent, and being continued out would undoubted-
ly inter$ect the triangle.</P>
<P>SIMP. Without taking it upon tru$t from you, I know the
$ame; and am not $o very naked of <I>Geometry,</I> as not to know a
Propo$ition, which I have had occa$ion of reading very often in
<I>Ari$totle,</I> that is, that the three angles of all triangles are equall to
two right angles: $o that if I take in my Figure the triangle ABE,
it being $uppo$ed that the line E A is right; I very well conceive,
that its three angles A, E, B, are equal to two right angles; and
that con$equently the two angles E and A are le$$e than two right
angles, $o much as is the angle B. Whereupon widening the lines
A B and E B ($till keeping them from moving out of the points A
and E) untill that the angle conteined by them towards the parts
B, di$appear, the two angles beneath $hall be equal to two right
angles, and tho$e lines $hall be reduced to parallels: and if one
$hould proceed to enlarge them yet more, the angles at the points
E and A would become greater than two right angles.</P>
<P>SALV. You are an <I>Archimedes,</I> and have freed me from the
expence of more words in declaring to you, that when$oever the
calculations make the two angles A and E to be greater than two
right angles, the ob$ervations without more adoe will prove erro-
neous. This is that which I had a de$ire that you $hould perfect-
ly under$tand, and which I doubted that I was not able $o to make
out, as that a meer <I>Peripatetick</I> Philo$opher might attain to the
certain knowledg thereof. Now let us go on to what remains.
And re-a$$uming that which even now you granted me, namely,
that the new $tar could not po$$ibly be in many places, but in one
alone, when ever the $upputations made upon the ob$ervations of
the$e A$tronomers do not a$$ign it the $ame place, its nece$$ary
that it be an errour in the ob$ervations, that is, either in taking the
altitudes of the pole, or in taking the elevations of the $tar, or in
the one or other working. Now for that in the many workings
made with the combinations two by two, there are very few of
the ob$ervations that do agree to place the $tar in the $ame $itua-
tion; therefore the$e few onely may happily be the non-errone-
ous, but the others are all ab$olutely fal$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. It will be nece$$ary then to give more credit to the$e
few alone, than to all the re$t together, and becau$e you $ay,
that the$e which accord are very few, and I among$t the$e 12,
do find two that $o accord, which both make the di$tance of the
<foot>$tar</foot>
<p n=>262</p>
$tar from the centre of the Earth 4 $emidiameters, which are the$e,
the fifth and $ixth, therefore it is more probable that the new $tar
was elementary, than cele$tial.</P>
<P>SALV. You mi$take the point; for if you note well it was not
written, that the di$tance was exactly 4 $emidiameters, but about
4 $emidiameters; and yet you $hall $ee that tho$e two di$tances
differed from each other many hundreds of miles. Here they are;
you $ee that this fifth, which is 13389 <I>Italian</I> miles, exceeds the
$ixth, which is 13100 miles, by almo$t 300 miles.</P>
<P>SAGR. Which then are tho$e few that agree in placing the $tar
in the $ame $ituation?</P>
<P>SALV. They are, to the di$grace of this Author five workings,
which all place it in the firmament, as you $hall $ee in this note,
where I have $et down many other combinations. But I will grant
the Author more than peradventure he would demand of me, which
is in $um, that in each combination of the ob$ervations there is
$ome error; which I believe to be ab$olutely nece$$ary; for the
ob$ervations being four in number that $erve for one working,
that is, two different altitudes of the Pole, and two different eleva-
tions of the $tar, made by different ob$ervers, in different pla-
ces, with different in$truments, who ever hath any $mall know-
<marg><I>A$tronomical In-
struments are very
$ubject to errour.</I></marg>
ledg of this art, will $ay, that among$t all the four, it is impo$$ible
but there will be $ome error; and e$pecially $ince we $ee that in
taking but one onely altitude of the Pole, with the $ame in$tru-
ment, in the $ame place, by the $ame ob$erver, that hath re-
peated the ob$ervation a thou$and times, there will $till be a titu-
bation of one, or $ometimes of many minutes, as in this $ame
book you may $ee in $everal places. The$e things pre$uppo$ed,
I ask you <I>Simplicius</I> whether you believe that this Authour held
the$e thirteen ob$ervators for wi$e, under$tanding and expert men
in u$ing tho$e in$truments, or el$e for inexpert, and bunglers?</P>
<P>SIMP. It mu$t needs be that he e$teemed them very acute and
intelligent; for if he had thought them unskilful in the bu$ine$$e,
he might have omitted his $ixth book as inconclu$ive, as being
founded upon $uppo$itions very erroneous; and might take us for
exce$$ively $imple, if he $hould think he could with their inex-
pertne$$e per$wade us to believe a fal$e po$ition of his for truth.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore the$e ob$ervators being $uch, and that yet
notwith$tanding they did erre, and $o con$equently needed cor-
rection, that $o one might from their ob$ervations infer the
be$t hints that may be; it is convenient that we apply unto them
the lea$t and neere$t emendations and corrections that may be;
$o that they do but $uffice to reduce the ob$ervations from impo$-
$ibility to po$$ibility; $o as <I>v. gr.</I> if one may but correct a mani-
fe$t errour, and an apparent impo$$ibility of one of their ob$er-
<foot>vations</foot>
<p n=>263</p>
vations by the addition or $ub$traction of two or three minutes, and
with that amendment to reduce it to po$$ibility, a man ought
not to e$$ay to adju$t it by the addition or $ub$traction of fifteen,
twenty, or fifty.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think the Authour would not deny this: for granting
that they are expert and judicious men, it ought to be thought that
they did rather erre little than much.</P>
<P>SALV. Ob$erve again; The places where the new Star is pla-
ced, are $ome of them manife$tly impo$$ible, and others po$$ible.
Ab$olutely impo$$ible it is, that it $hould be an infinite $pace $upe-
riour to the fixed Stars, for there is no $uch place in the world;
and if there were, the Star there $cituate would have been imper-
ceptible to us: it is al$o impo$$ible that it $hould go creeping along
the $uperficies of the Earth; and much le$$e that it $hould be
within the $aid Terre$trial Globe. Places po$$ible are the$e that
be in controver$ie, it not interferring with our under$tanding, that
a vi$ible object in the likene$$e of a Star might be a$well above the
Moon, as below it. Now whil$t one goeth about to compute by
the way of Ob$ervations and Calculations made with the utmo$t
certainty that humane diligence can attain unto what its place was,
it is found that the greate$t part of tho$e Calculations make it
more than infinitely $uperiour to the Firmament, others make it
very neer to the $urface of the Earth, and $ome al$o under the
$ame; and of the re$t, which place it in $ituations not impo$$ible,
none of them agree with each other; in$omuch that it mu$t be
confe$$ed, that all tho$e ob$ervations are nece$$arily fal$e; $o that
if we would neverthele$s collect $ome fruit from $o many laborious
calculations, we mu$t have recour$e to the corrections, amending
all the ob$ervations.</P>
<P>SIMP. But the Authour will $ay, that of the ob$ervations that
a$$ign to the Star impo$$ible places, there ought no account to be
made, as being extreamly erroneous and fal$e; and tho$e onely
ought to be accepted, that con$titute it in places not impo$$ible:
and among$t the$e a man ought to $eek, by help of the mo$t pro-
bable, and mo$t numerous concurrences, not if the particular and
exact $ituation, that is, its true di$tance from the centre of the
Earth, at lea$t, whether it was among$t the Elements, or el$e a-
mong$t the C&oelig;le$tial bodies.</P>
<P>SALV. The di$cour$e which you now make, is the $elf $ame
that the Author made, in favour of his cau$e, but with too unrea-
$onable a di$advantage to his adver$aries; and this is that princi-
pal point that hath made me exce$$ively to wonder at the too great
confidence that he expre$$ed to have, no le$s of his own authority,
than of the blindne$s and inadvertency of the A$tronomers; in
favour of whom I will $peak, and you $hall an$wer for the Author.
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>264</p>
And fir$t, I ask you, whether the A$tronomers, in ob$erving with
their In$truments, and $eeking <I>v. gr.</I> how great the elevation of a
Star is above the Horizon, may deviate from the truth, a$well in
making it too great, as too little; that is, may erroneou$ly com-
pute, that it is $ometime higher than the truth, and $ometimes low-
er; or el$e whether the errour mu$t needs be alwayes of one
kinde, to wit, that erring they alwayes make it too much, and ne-
ver too little, or alwayes too little, and never too much?</P>
<P>SIMP. I doubt not, but that it is as ea$ie to commit an errour
the one way, as the other.</P>
<P>SALV. I believe the Author would an$wer the $ame. Now of
the$e two kinds of errours, which are contraries, and into which the
ob$ervators of the new $tar may equally have fallen, applied to
calculations, one $ort will make the $tar higher, and the other lower
than really it is. And becau$e we have already agreed, that all
the ob$ervations are fal$e; upon what ground would this Au-
thor have us to accept tho$e for mo$t congruous with the truth,
that $hew the $tar to have been near at hand, than the others that
$hew it exce$$ively remote?</P>
<P>SIMP. By what I have, as yet, collected of the Authors mind,
I $ee not that he doth refu$e tho$e ob$ervations, and indagations
that might make the $tar more remote than the Moon, and al$o
than the Sun, but only tho$e that make it remote (as you your $elf
have $aid) more than an infinite di$tance; the which di$tance, be-
cau$e you al$o do refu$e it as impo$$ible, he al$o pa$$eth over, as
being convicted of infinite fal$hood; as al$o tho$e ob$ervations
are of impo$$ibility. Methinks, therefore, that if you would con-
vince the Author, you ought to produce $upputations, more exact,
or more in number, or of more diligent ob$ervers, which con$titute
the $tar in $uch and $uch a di$tance above the Moon, or above the
Sun, and to be brief, in a place po$$ible for it to be in, like as he
produceth the$e twelve, which all place the $tar beneath the Moon
in places that have a being in the world, and where it is po$$ible for
it to be.</P>
<P>SALV. But <I>Simplicius</I> yours and the Authors Equivocation
lyeth in this, yours in one re$pect, and the Authors in another; I
di$cover by your $peech that you have formed a conceit to your
$elf, that the exorbitancies that are commited in the e$tabli$hing
the di$tance of the Star do encrea$e $ucce$$ively, according to the
proportion of the errors that are made by the In$trument, in tak-
ing the ob$ervations, and that by conver$ion, from the greatne$s
of the exorbitancies, may be argued the greatne$$e of the error;
and that thereforefore hearing it to be infered from $uch an ob$er-
vation, that the di$tance of the $tar is infinite, it is nece$$ary, that
the errour in ob$erving was infinite, and therefore not to be amend-
<foot>ed,</foot>
<p n=>265</p>
ed, and as $uch to be refu$ed; but the bu$ine$$e doth not $ucceed
in that manner, my <I>Simplicius,</I> and I excu$e you for not having
comprehended the matter as it is, in regard of your $mall experi-
ence in $uch affairs; but yet cannot I under that cloak palliate the
error of the Author, who di$$embling the knowledge of this which
he did per$wade him$elf that we in good earne$t did not under-
$tand, hath hoped to make u$e of our ignorance, to gain the bet-
ter credit to his Doctrine, among the multitude of illiterate men.
Therefore for an adverti$ement to tho$e who are more credulous
then intelligent, and to recover you from error, know that its po$-
$ible (and that for the mo$t part it will come to pa$$e) that an
ob$ervation, that giveth you the $tar <I>v. gr.</I> at the di$tance of <I>Sa-
turn,</I> by the adition or $ub$traction of but one $ole minute from
the elevation taken with the in$trument, $hall make it to become
infinitely di$tant; and therefore of po$$ible, impo$$ible, and by
conver$ion, tho$e calculations which being grounded upon tho$e
ob$ervations, make the $tar infinitely remote, may po$$ibly often-
times with the addition or $ubduction of one $ole minute, reduce it
to a po$$ible $cituation: and this which I $ay of a minute, may al-
$o happen in the correction of half a minute, a $ixth part, and le$s.
Now fix it well in your mind, that in the highe$t di$tances, that is
<I>v. g.</I> the height of <I>Saturn,</I> or that of the fixed Stars, very $mall
errors made by the Ob$ervator, with the in$trument, render the
$cituation determinate and po$$ible, infinite &amp; impo$$ible. This doth
not $o evene in the $ublunary di$tances, and near the earth, where
it may happen that the ob$ervation by which the Star is collected to
be remote <I>v. g.</I> 4. Semidiameters terre$trial, may encrea$e or dimi-
ni$h, not onely one minute but ten, and an hundred, and many
more, without being rendred by the calculation either infinitely
remote, or $o much as $uperior to the Moon. You may hence
comprehend that the greatne$$e of the error (to $o $peak) in$tru-
mental, are not to be valued by the event of the calculation, but
by the quantity it $elf of degrees and minutes numbred upon the
in$trument, and the$e ob$ervations are to be called more ju$t or
le$s erroneous, which with the addition or $ub$traction of fewer
minutes, re$tore the $tar to<*>a po$$ible $ituation; and among$t the
po$$ible places, the true one may be believed to have been that, a-
bout which a greater number of di$tances concurre upon calcula-
ting the more exact ob$ervations.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not very well apprehend this which you $ay: nor
can I of my $elf conceive how it can be, that in greater di$tances,
greater exorbitancies can ari$e from the errour of one minute only,
than in the $maller from ten or an hundred; and therefore would
gladly under$tand the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. You $hall $ee it, if not Theorically, yet at lea$t Practi-
<foot>Ll cally,</foot>
<p n=>266</p>
cally, by this $hort a$$umption, that I have made of all the combi-
nations, and of part of the workings pretermitted by the Author,
which I have calculated upon this $ame paper.</P>
<P>SAGR. You mu$t then from ye$terday, till now, which yet is
not above eighteen hours, have done nothing but compute, with-
out taking either food or $leep.</P>
<P>SALV. I have refre$hed my $elf both tho$e wayes; but truth is,
make the$e $upputations with great brevity; and, if I may $peak
the truth, I have much admired, that this Author goeth $o farre a-
bout, and introduceth $o many computations no wi$e nece$sary to
the que$tion in di$pute. And for a full knowledge of this, and al-
$o to the end it may $oon be $een, how that from the ob$ervations
of the A$tronomers, whereof this Author makes u$e, it is more pro-
bably gathered, that the new $tar might have been above the
Moon, and al$o above all the Planets, yea among$t the fixed $tars,
and yet higher $till than they, I have tran$cribed upon this paper
all the ob$ervations $et down by the $aid Authour, which were
made by thirteen A$tronomers, wherein are noted the Polar alti-
tude, and the altitudes of the $tar in the meridian, a$well the
le$$er under the Pole, as the greater and higher, and they are
the$e.</P>

<foot>Ll 2 Now</foot>
<p n=>268</p>
<P>Now to $ee my whole proceeding, we may begin from the$e
calculations, which are four, omitted by the Author, perhaps be-
cau$e they make again$t him, in regard they place the $tar above
the moon by many $emidiameters of the Earth. The fir$t of
which is this, computed upon the ob$ervations of the Landgrave of
<I>Ha$$ia,</I> and <I>Tycho</I>; which are, even by the Authors conce$$ion,
two of the mo$t exact ob$ervers: and in this fir$t, I will declare
the order that I hold in the working; which $hall $erve for all the
re$t, in that they are all made by the $ame rule, not varying in any
thing, $ave in the quantity of the given $ummes, that is, in the
number of the degrees of the Poles altitude, and of the new Stars
elevation above the Horizon, the di$tance of which from the cen-
tre of the Earth, in proportion to the $emidiameter of the terre-
$trial Globe is $ought, touching which it nothing imports in this
ca$e, to know how many miles that $emidiameter conteineth;
whereupon the re$olving that, and the di$tance of places where
the ob$ervations were made, as this Author doth, is but time and
labour lo$t; nor do I know why he hath made the $ame, and e$pe-
cially why at the la$t he goeth about to reduce the miles found, in-
to $emidiameters of the Terre$trial Globe.</P>
<P>SIMP. Perhaps he doth this to finde with $uch $mall mea$ures,
and with their fractions the di$tance of the Star terminated to three
or four inches; for we that do not under$tand your rules of Arith-
metick, are $tupified in hearing your conclu$ions; as for in$tance,
whil$t we read; Therefore the new Star or Comet was di$tant
from the Earths centre three hundred $eventy and three thou$and
eight hundred and $even miles; and moreover, two hundred and
eleven, four chou$and ninety $evenths 373807 211/4097, and upon the$e
preci$e punctualities, wherein you take notice of $uch $mall mat-
ters, we do conceive it to be impo$$ible, that you, who in our cal-
culations keep an account of an inch, can at the clo$e deceive us $o
much as an hundred miles.</P>
<P>SALV. This your rea$on and excu$e would pa$$e for currant,
if in a di$tance of thou$ands of miles, a yard over or under were
of any great moment, and if the $uppo$itions that we take for
true, were $o certain, as that they could a$$ure us of producing an
indubitable truth in the conclu$ion; but here you $ee in the twelve
workings of the Author, the di$tances of the Star, which from
them one may conclude to have been different from each other,
(and therefore wide of the truth) for many hundreds and thou-
$ands of miles: now whil$t that I am more than certain, that that
which I $eek mu$t needs differ from the truth by hundreds of miles,
to what purpp$e is it to be $o curious in our calculations, for fear
of mi$$ing the quantity of an inch? But let us proceed, at la$t,
to the working, which I re$olve in this manner. <I>Tycho,</I> as may be

$een in that $ame note ob$erved the $tar in the polar altitude of 55
degrees and 58 <I>mi. pri.</I> And the polar altitude of the <I>Landgrave</I>
was 51 degrees and 18 <I>mi. pri.</I> The altitude of the $tar in the Me-
ridian taken by <I>Tycho</I> was 27 degrees 45 <I>mi. pri.</I> The <I>Land-
grave</I> found its altitude 23 degrees 3 <I>mi. pri.</I> The which altitudes

becau$e the angle B A D, conteined between the vertical lines, is
equal to the difference of the Polar altitudes, it $hall be 4<I>gr. 40m.</I>
which I note here apart; and I finde the chord of it by the Table
of Arches and Chords, and $et it down neer unto it, which is 8142
parts, of which the $emidiameter A B is 100000. Next, I finde
the angle B D C with ea$e, for the half of the angle B A D, which
is 2 <I>gr. 20 m.</I> added to a right angle, giveth the angle B D F 92 <I>gr.</I>
20 <I>m.</I> to which adding the angle C D F, which is the di$tance from
the vertical point of the greate$t altitude of the Star, which here is
62 <I>gr. 15 m.</I> it giveth us the quantity of the angle B D C,
154 <I>grad. 45 min.</I> the which I $et down together with its Sine,
taken out of the Table, which is 42657, and under this I note
the angle of the Parallax B C D 0 <I>gr. 2 m.</I> with its Sine 58.
And becau$e in the Triangle B C D, the $ide D B is to the $ide
B C; as the $ine of the oppo$ite angle B C D, to the $ine of the
oppo$ite angle B D C: therefore, if the line B D were 58. B C
would be 42657. And becau$e the Chord D B is 8142. of tho$e
parts whereof the $emidiameter B A is 100000. and we $eek to
know how many of tho$e parts is B C; therefore we will $ay, by
the Golden Rule, if when B D is 58. B G is 42657. in ca$e the
$aid D B were 8142. how much would B C be? I multiply the
$econd term by the third, and the product is 347313294. which
ought to be divided by the fir$t, namely, by 58. and the quotient
$hall be the number of the parts of the line B C, whereof the $e-
midiameter A B is 100000. And to know how many $emidiame-
ters B A, the $aid line B C doth contein, it will be nece$$ary anew
to divide the $aid quotient $o found by 100000. and we $hall have
the number o$ $emidiameters conteined in B G. Now the num-
ber 347313294. divided by 58. giveth 5988160 1/4. as here you
may $ee.</P>

<P>The$e as you $ee are five workings which place the $tar very
much above the Moon. And here I de$ire you to con$ider upon
that particular, which even now I told you, namely, that in great
<foot>Mm di-</foot>
<p n=>274</p>
di$tances, the mutations, or if you plea$e corrections, of a ve-
ry few minutes, removeth the $tar a very great way farther off.
As for example, in the fir$t of the$e workings, where the calcu-
lation made the $tar 60. $emidiameters remote from the centre,
with the Parallax of 2. minutes; he that would maintain that it
was in the Firmament, is to correct in the ob$ervations but onely
two minutes, nay le$$e, for then the Parallax cea$eth, or be-
commeth $o $mall, that it removeth the $tar to an immen$e di-
$tance, which by all is received to be the Firmament. In the $e-
cond indagation, or working, the correction of le$$e than 4 <I>m.
prim.</I> doth the $ame. In the third, and fourth, like as in the fir$t,
two minutes onely mount the $tar even above the Firmament.
In the la$t preceding, a quarter of a minute, that is 15. $econds,
gives us the $ame. But it doth not $o occur in the $ublunary alti-
tudes; for if you fancy to your $elf what di$tance you mo$t
like, and go about to correct the workings made by the Au-
thour, and adju$t them $o as that they all an$wer in the $ame
determinate di$tance, you will find how much greater correcti-
ons they do require.</P>
<P>SAGR. It cannot but help us in our fuller under$tanding of
things, to $ee $ome examples of this which you $peak of.</P>
<P>SALV. Do you a$$ign any what$oever determinate $ublunary
di$tance at plea$ure in which to con$titute the $tar, for with $mall
ado we may a$$ertain our $elves whether corrections like to the$e,
which we $ee do $uffice to reduce it among$t the fixed $tars, will
reduce it to the place by you a$$igned.</P>
<P>SAGR. To take a di$tance that may favour the Authour, we
will $uppo$e it to be that which is the greate$t of all tho$e found
by him in his 12 workings; for whil$t it is in controver$ie be-
tween him and A$tronomers, and that they affirm the $tar to
have been $uperiour to the Moon, and he that it was inferiour,
very $mall $pace that he proveth it to have been lower, giveth
him the victory.</P>
<P>SALV. Let us therefore take the $eventh working wrought
upon the ob$ervations of <I>Tycho</I> and <I>Thadd&aelig;us Hagecius,</I> by
which the Authour found the $tar to have been di$tant from the
centre 32. $emidiameters, which $ituation is mo$t favourable to
his purpo$e; and to give him all advantages, let us moreover
place it in the di$tance mo$t disfavouring the <I>A$tronomers,</I> which
is to $ituate it above the Firmament. That therefore being $up-
po$ed, let us $eek in the next place what corrections it would be ne-
ce$$ary to apply to his other 11 workings. And let us begin at the
fir$t calculated upon the ob$ervations of <I>Hainzelius</I> and <I>Mauroice</I>;
in which the Authour findeth the di$tance from the centre about
3. $emidiameters with the Parallax of 4 <I>gr. 42 m. 30. $ec.</I> Let

ing made upon the ob$ervations of <I>Hainzelius</I> and <I>Tycho,</I> which
rendereth the $tar about 19 $emidiameters high, with the Pa-
rallax of 10 <I>m. pri.</I> The u$ual angles and their $ines, and chord
found by the Authour, are the$e next following; and they re-
move the $tar (as al$o in the Authours working) 19 $emidia-
meters from the centre of the Earth. It is nece$$ary therefore for
the rai$ing of it, to dimini$h the Parallax according to the Rule
which he likewi$e ob$erveth in the ninth working. Let us there-
fore $uppo$e the Parallax to be 6 <I>m. prim.</I> who$e $ine is 175, and
the divi$ion being made, there is found likewi$e le$$e than 31
$emidiameters for the $tars di$tance. And therefore the correcti-
on of 4 <I>min. prim.</I> is too little to $erve the Authours purpo$e.</P>

will the tenth part of a minute reduce the height of the $tar to

the true height of the Star, the correction of tho$e his 10. workings,

them all to re$tore the $aid Star to that di$tance, would require $uch

5. calculated by me, which do place the Star above the Moon, to
correct them in $uch $ort, as to con$titute it in the Firmament,
the correction onely of 10. minutes, and one fourth $ufficeth.</P>
<P>Now adde to the$e, other 5. workings, that place the Star pre-
ci$ely in the Firmament, without need of any correction at all,

it in the Firmament, with the correction onely of 5. of them (as

on of tho$e 10. of the Authour, to reduce them to the altitude of
32. $emidiameters, there will need the emendations of 756 mi-

cted 756. if you would have the Star elevated to the altitude of
32. $emidiameters, and yet that correction doth not fully $erve.</P>

lime to an infinite di$tance, are many in number, namely, about
30. more than tho$e who give the Star, by calculation, to be be-

is to be believed that the Ob$ervators have erred rather little than
much, it is a manife$t thing that the corrections to be applied to

the opinion of tho$e who put it among$t the fixed Stars. You may
adde, that the corrections required for tho$e emendations, are
much le$$er than tho$e, by which the Star from an unlikely proxi-
mity may be removed to the height more favourable for this Au-
thour, as by the foregoing examples hath been $een; among$t
which impo$$ible proximities, there are three that $eem to remove
the Star from the Earths centre, a le$$e di$tance than one Semidi-
ameter, making it, as it were, to turn round under ground, and
the$e are tho$e combinations, wherein the Polar altitude of one
of the Ob$ervators being greater than the Polar altitude of the
other, the elevation of the Star taken by the fir$t, is le$$er than the
elation of the Star taken by the latter.</P>
<P>The fir$t of the$e is this of the <I>Landgrave</I> with <I>Gemma,</I>
where the Polar altitude of the <I>Landgrave 51 gr. 18 min.</I> is
greater than the Polar altitude of <I>Gemma,</I> which is 50 <I>gr. 50 m.</I>
But the altitude of the Star of the <I>Landgrave 79 gr. 30 min.</I>
is le$$er than that of the Star, of <I>Gemma 79 gr. 45 min.</I></P>

<P>From what I have hitherto demon$trated, you may gue$$e how
much this fir$t way of finding out the di$tance of the Star, and
proving it $ublunary introduced by the Authour, maketh again$t
him$elf, and how much more probably and clearly the di$tance
thereof is collected to have been among$t the more remote fixed
Stars.</P>
<P>SIMP. As to this particular, I think that the inefficacy of the
Authors demonftrations is very plainly di$covered; But I $ee that all
this was compri$ed in but a few leaves of his Book, and it may be,
that $ome other of his Arguments are more conclu$ive then the$e
fir$t.</P>
<P>SALV. Rather they mu$t needs be le$$e valid, if we will take
tho$e that lead the way for a proof of the re$t: For (as it is clear)
the uncertainty and inconclu$ivene$$e of tho$e, is manife$tly ob-
$erved to derive it $elf from the errours committed in the in$tru-
mental ob$ervations, upon which the Polar Altitude, and height
of the Star was thought to have been ju$tly taken, all in effect
having ea$ily erred; And yet to find the Altitude of the Pole, A-
$tronomers have had Ages of time to apply them$elves to it, at their
lea$ure: and the Meridian Altitudes of the Star are ea$ier to be
ob$erved, as being mo$t terminate, and yielding the Ob$ervator
$ome time to continue the $ame, in regard they change not $en$ibly,
in a $hort time, as tho$e do that are remote from the Meridian. And
if this be $o, as it is mo$t certain, what credit $hall we give to Calcu-
lations founded upon Ob$ervations more numerous, more difficult
to be wrought, more momentary in variation, and we may add,
with In$truments more incommodious and erroneous? Upon a
$light peru$al of the en$uing demon$trations, I $ee that the Com-
putations are made upon Altitudes of the Star taken in different
Vertical Circles, which are called by the Arabick name, <I>Azimuths</I>; in
which ob$ervations moveable in$truments are made u$e of, not on-
ly in the Vertical Circles, but in the Horizon al$o, at the $ame time;
in$omuch that it is requi$ite in the $ame moment that the altitude
is taken, to have ob$erved, in the Horizon, the di$tance of the Vir-
<foot>tical</foot>
<p n=>285</p>
tical point in which the Star is, from the Meridian; Moreover,
after a con$iderable interval of time, the operation mu$t be re-
peated, and exact account kept of the time that pa$$ed, tru$ting
either to Dials, or to other ob$ervations of the Stars. Such an <I>Olio</I>
of Ob$ervations doth he $et before you, comparing them with
$uch another made by another ob$erver in another place with a-
nother different in$trument, and at another time; and from this
the Authour $eeks to collect what would have been, the Elevations
of the Star, and Horizontal Latitudes happened in the time and
hour of the other fir$t ob$ervations, and upon $uch a co&aelig;quation he
in the end grounds his account. Now I refer it to you, what credit
is to be given to that which is deduced from $uch like workings.
Moreover, I doubt not in the lea$t, but that if any one would tor-
ture him$elf with $uch tedious computations, he would find, as in
tho$e aforegoing, that there were more that would favour the ad-
ver$e party, than the Authour: But I think it not worth the while
to take $o much pains in a thing, which is not, among$t tho$e prima-
ry ones, by us under$tood.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am of your Opinion in this particular: But this bu$i-
ne$$e being environed with $o many intricacies, uncertainties, and
errours, upon what confidence have $o many A$tronomers po$itive-
ly pronounced the new Star to have been $o high?</P>
<P>SALV. Upon two $orts of ob$ervations mo$t plain, mo$t ea$ie,
and mo$t certain; one only of which is more than $ufficient to a$$ure
us, that it was $cituate in the Firmament, or at lea$t by a great
di$tance $uperiour to the Moon. One of which is taken from the
equality, or little differing inequality of its di$tances from the
Pole, a$well whil$t it was in the lowe$t part of the Meridian, as
when it was in the uppermo$t: The other is its having perpetual-
ly kept the $ame di$tances from certain of the fixed Stars, adjacent
to it, and particularly from the eleventh of <I>Ca$$iopea,</I> no more
remote from it than one degree and an half; from which two par-
ticulars is undoubtedly inferred, either the ab$olute want of Paral-
lax, or $uch a $malne$$e thereof, that it doth a$$ure us with very
expeditious Calculations of its great di$tance from the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. But the$e things, were they not known to this Author?
and if he $aw them, what doth he $ay unto them?</P>
<P>SALV. We are wont to $ay, of one that having no reply that
is able to cover his fault, produceth frivolous excu$es, <I>cerca di at-
taccar$i alle funi del cielo,</I> [He $trives to take hold of the Cords of
Heaven;] but this Authour runs, not to the Cords, but to the Spi-
ders Web of Heaven; as you $hall plainly $ee in our examination
of the$e two particulars even now hinted. And fir$t, that which
$heweth us the Polar di$tances of the Ob$ervators one by one, I
have noted down in the$e brief Calculations; For a full under-
<foot>$tand-</foot>
<p n=>286</p>
$tanding of which, I ought fir$t to adverti$e you, that when ever
the new Star, or other Ph&aelig;nomenon is near to the earth, turning
with a Diurnal motion about the Pole, it will $eem to be farther
off from the $aid Pole, whil$t it is in the lower part of the Meridi-
an, then whil$t it is above, as in this Figure [<I>being fig. third of
this Dial.</I>] may be $een. In which the point T. denotes the cen-
tre of the Earth; O th<*> place of the Ob$ervator; the Arch VPC
the Firmament; P. the Pole. The <I>Ph&aelig;nomenon,</I> [<I>or appearance</I>]
moving along the Circle F S. is $een one while under the Pole by
the Ray O F C. and another while above, according to the Ray
O S D. $o that the places $een in the Firmament are D. and C. but
the true places in re$pect of the Centre T, are B, and A, equidi-
$tant from the Pole. Where it is manife$t that the apparent place
of the <I>Ph&aelig;nomenon</I> S, that is the point D, is nearer to the Pole than
the other apparent place C, $een along the Line or Ray O F C,
which is the fir$t thing to be noted. In the $econd place you mu$t
note that the exces of the apparent inferiour di$tance from the Pole,
over and above the apparent $uperiour di$tance from the $aid Pole,
is greater than the Inferiour Parallax of the <I>Ph&aelig;nomenon,</I> that is, I
$ay, that the exce$$e of the Arch C P, (the apparent inferior di-
$tance) over and above the Arch P D, (the apparent $uperior di-
$tance) is greater then the Arch C A, (that is the inferiour Para-
lax.) Which is ea$ily proved; for the Arch C P. more exceedeth
P D, then P B; P B, being bigger than P D, but P B. is equal to
P A, and the exce$$e of C P, above P A, is the arch, C A, there-
fore the exce$$e of the arch C P above the arch P D, is great-
er than the arch C A, which is the parallax of the Ph&aelig;nomenon
placed in F, which was to be demon$trated. And to give all ad-
vantages to the Author, let us $uppo$e that the parallax of the $tar
in F, is the whole exce$$e of the arch C P (that is of the inferiour
di$tance from the pole) above the arch P D (the inferiour di-
$tance.) I proceed in the next place to examine that which the
ob$ervations of all A$tronomers cited by the Authour giveth us,
among$t which, there is not one that maketh not again$t him$elf
and his purpo$e. And let us begin with the$e of <I>Bu$chius,</I> who
findeth the $tars di$tance from the pole, when it was $uperiour, to be
28 <I>gr. 10 m.</I> and the inferiour to be 28 <I>gr. 30 m.</I> $o that the ex-
ce$$e is 0 <I>gr. 20 m.</I> which let us take (in favour of the Author) as
if it all were the parallax of the $tar in F, that is the angle T F O.
Then the di$tance from the <I>Vertex</I> [or Zenith] that is the arch
C V, is 67 <I>gr. 20 m.</I> The$e two things being found, prolong the
line C O, and from it let fall the perpendicular T I, and let us
con$ider the triangle T O I, of which the angle I is right angle,
and the angle I O T known, as being vertical to the angle V O C,
the di$tance of the $tar from the <I>Vertex,</I> Moreover in the triangle
<foot>T I F,</foot>
<p n=>287</p>
T I F, which is al$o rectangular, there is known the angle F, ta-
ken by the parallax. Then note in $ome place apart the two an-
gles I O T and I F T, and of them take the $ines, which are
here $et down to them, as you $een. And becau$e in the triangle
I O T, the $ine T I is 92276. of tho$e parts, whereof the whole
$ine TO is 100000; and moreover in the triangle I F T, the $ine T I
is 582. of tho$e parts, whereof the whole $ine T F is 100000, to
find how many T F is of tho$e parts, whereof T O is 100000;
we will $ay by the Rule of three: If T I be 582. T F is an
100000. but if T I were 92276. how much would T F be.
Let us multiply 92276. by 100000. and the product will be
9227600000. and this mu$t be divided by 582. and the quotient
will be 15854982. and $o many $hall there be in T F of tho$e
parts, of which there are in T O an 100000. So that if it were
required to know how many lines T O, are in T F, we would
divide 15854982 by 100000. and there will come forth 158. and
very near an half; and $o many diameters $hall be the di$tance
of the $tar F, from the centre T, and to abreviate the opera-
tion, we $eeing, that the product of the multiplication of 92276.
by 100000, ought to be divided fir$t by 582, and then the quo-
tient of that divi$ion by 100000. we may without multiplying
92276. by 100000. and with one onely divi$ion of the $ine
92276. by the $ine 582. $oon obtain the $ame $olution, as may
be $een there below; where 92276. divided by 582. giveth us the
$aid 158 1/2, or thereabouts. Let us bear in mind therefore, that
the onely divi$ion of the $ine T I, as the $ine of the angle T O I
by the $ine T I, as the $ine of the angle I F T, giveth us the di-
$tance $ought T F, in $o many diameters T O.</P>

e$t Regions.</P>
<P>SAGR. But what defence hath he for him$elf again$t $o manife$t
contradictions?</P>
<P>SALV. He betakes him$elf to one of tho$e weak threads which
I $peak of; $aying that the <I>Parallaxes</I> come to be le$$ened by means
of the refractions, which opperating contrarily $ublimate the <I>Ph&aelig;-
nomenon,</I> whereas the <I>Parallaxes</I> aba$e it. Now of what little
$tead this lamentable refuge is, judge by this, that in ca$e that effectof
the refractions were of $uch an efficacy, as that which not long time
$ince $ome A$tronomers have introduced, the mo$t that they could
work touching the elevating a <I>Ph&aelig;uomenon</I> above the Horizon
<foot>Oo more</foot>
<p n=>290</p>
more than truth, when it is before hand 23. or 24. Degrees high,
would be the le$$ening its <I>Parallax</I> about 3. minutes, the which
abatement is too $mall to pull down the Star below the Moon, and
in $ome ca$es is le$$e than the advantage given him by us in admit-
ting that the exce$$e of the inferiour di$tance from the Pole above
the Superiour, is all <I>Parallax,</I> the which advantage is far more clear
and palpable than the effect of Refracton, of the greatne$$e of
which I $tand in doubt, and not without rea$on. But be$ides, I
demand of the Author, whether he thinks that tho$e A$tronomers,
of who$e ob$ervations he maketh u$e, had knowledge of the$e ef-
fects of Refractions, and con$idered the $ame, or no; if they did
know and con$ider them, it is rea$onable to think that the, kept ac-
count of them in a$$igning the true Elevation of the Star, making
in tho$e degrees of Altitude di$covered with the In$truments, $uch
abatements as were convenient on the account of the alterations
made by the Refractions; in$omuch that the di$tances by them de-
livered, were in the end tho$e corrected and exact, and not the ap-
parent and fal$e ones. But if he think that tho$e Authors made
no reflection upon the $aid Refractions, it mu$t be confe$$ed, that
they had in like manner erred in determining all tho$e things which
cannot be perfectly adju$ted without allowance for the Refracti-
ons; among$t which things one is the preci$e inve$tigation of the
Polar Altitudes, which are commonly taken from the two Meridi-
an Altitudes of $ome of the fixed Stars that are con$tantly vi$ible,
which Altitudes will come to be altered by Refraction in the $ame
manner, ju$t as tho$e of the new Star; $o that the Polar Altitude
that is deduced from them, will prove to be defective, and to par-
take of the $elf $ame want which this Author a$$igns to the Alti-
tudes a$cribed to the new Star, to wit, both that and the$e will
be with equal fal$hood placed higher than really they are. But any
$uch errour, as far as concerns our pre$ent bu$ine$$e, doth no pre-
judce at all: For we not needing to know any more, but onely
the difference between the two di$tances of the new Star from the
Pole at $uch time as it was inferiour and $uperiour, it is evident that
$uch di$tances would be the $ame, taking the alteration of Refra-
ction commonly for the Star and for the Pole, or for them when
commonly amended. The Authors Argument would indeed have
had $ome $trength, though very $mall, if he had a$$ured us that
the Altitude of the Pole had been once preci$ely a$$igned, and cor-
rected from the errour depending on refraction, from which a-
gain the A$tronomers had not kept them$elves in a$$igning the al-
titudes of the new Star; but he hath not a$certained us of that,
nor perhaps could he have done, nor haply, (and this is more pro-
bable) was that caution wanting in the Ob$ervators.</P>
<P>SAGR. This argument is in my judgment $ufficiently an$wer-
<foot>ed;</foot>
<p n=>291</p>
ed; therefore tell me how he di$-ingageth him$elf in the next place
from that particular of the Stars having con$tantly kept the $ame
di$tance from the fixed Stars circumjacent to it.</P>
<P>SALV. He betakes him$elf, in like manner, to two threads, yet
more unable to uphold him than the former: one of which is like-
wi$e fa$tened to refraction, but $o much le$s firmly, in that he
$aith, that refraction operating upon the new Star, and $ublimating
it higher than its true $ituation, maketh the $eeming di$tances un-
tain to be di$tingui$hed from the true, when compared to the cir-
cumpo$ed fixed Stars that environ it. Nor can I $ufficiently ad-
mire how he can di$$emble his knowing how that the $ame refra-
ction will work alike upon the new Star, as upon the antient one
its neighbour, elevating both equally, $o as that $uch a like acci-
dent altereth not the $pace betwixt them. His other $ubterfuge is
yet more unhappy, and carryeth with it much of ridiculous, it be-
ing founded upon the errour that may ari$e in the in$trumen talo-
peration it $elf; whil$t that the Ob$ervator not being able to
con$titute the centre of the eyes pupil in the centre of the Sex-
tant (an In$trument imployed in ob$erving the di$tance between
two Stars) but holding it elevated above that centre, as much as
the $aid pupil is di$tant from I know not what bone of the cheek,
again$t which the end of the In$trument re$teth, there is formed
in the eye an angle more acute than that which is made by the $ides
of the In$trument; which angle of rayes differeth al$o from it
$elf, at $uch time as a man looketh upon Stars, not much elevated
above the Horizon, and the $ame being afterwards placed at a
great height; that angle, $aith he, is made different, while the In-
$trument goeth a$cending, the head $tanding $till: but if in moun-
ting the In$trument, the neck $hould bend backwards, and the
head go ri$ing, together with the In$trument, the angle would then
continue the $ame. So that the Authours an$wer $uppo$eth that
the Ob$ervators in u$ing the In$trument have not rai$ed the head,
as they ought to have done; a thing which hath nothing of likeli-
hood in it. But granting that $o it had been, I leave you to judge
what difference can be between two acute angles of two equicru-
ral triangles, the $ides of one of which triangles are each four
[<I>Italian] Braces</I> [<I>i.e.</I> about three Engli$h yards] and tho$e of the
other, four braces within the quantity of the diameter of a Pea;
for the differences cannot be ab$olutely greater between the length
of the two vi$ive rayes, whil$t the line is drawn perpendicularly
from the centre of the pupil, upon the plain of the Rule of the
Sextant (which line is no bigger than the breath of the thumb)
and the length of the $ame rayes, whil$t elevating the Sextant,
without rai$ing the head together with it, that $ame line no longer
falleth perpendicularly upon the $aid plane, but inclineth, making
<foot>Oo 2 the</foot>
<p n=>292</p>
the angle towards the circumference $omething acute. But wholly
to free this Authour from the$e unhappy lies, let him know, (in re-
gard it appears that he is not very skilful in the u$e of A$tronomi-
call In$truments) that in the $ides of the Sextant or Quadrant
<marg>* Traguardi.</marg>
there are placed two ^{*} Sights, one in the centre, and the other at
the other at the oppo$ite end, which are rai$ed an inch or more a-
bove the plane of the Rule; and through the tops of tho$e $ights
the ray of the eye is made to pa$$e, which eye likewi$e is held an
hands breadth or two, or it may be more, from the In$trument; $o
that neither the pupil, nor any bone of the cheek, nor of the whole
body toucheth or $tayeth it $elf upon the In$trument, nor much
le$$e is the In$trument upheld or mounted in the armes, e$pecially
if it be one of tho$e great ones, as is u$ual, which weighing tens,
hundreds, and al$o thou$ands of pounds, are placed upon very
$trong feet or frames: $o that the whole objection vani$heth.
The$e are the $ubterfuges of this Authour, which, though they were
all of $teel, would not $ecure him the hundredth part of a minute;
and with the$e he conceits to make us believe, that he hath com-
pen$ated that difference, which importeth more than an hundred
minutes; I mean, that of the not ob$erving a notable difference
in the di$tances between one of the fixed $tars, and the new $tar in
in any of their circulations; which, had it been neer to the Moon,
it ought to have been very con$picuous to the meer $ight, without
any In$trument, e$pecially comparing it with the eleventh of <I>Ca$-
$iopeia,</I> its neighbour, within 1 <I>gr. 30 m.</I> which ought to have va-
ried from it more than two diameters of the moon, as the more
intelligent A$tronomers of t' o$e times do well note.</P>
<P>SAGR. Methinks I $ee th<*>t unfortunate Husbandman, who af-
ter all his expected crops, have been beaten down and de$troyed by
a $torm, goeth up and down with a langui$hing and down-ca$t
look, gleaning up every $mall ear that would not $uffice to keep a
chicken alive one $ole day.</P>
<P>SALV. Truly, this Authour came out too $lenderly provided
with armes again$t the a$$ailants of the Heavens inalterability, and
with too brittle a chain attempted to pull down the new $tar of
<I>Ca$$iopeia</I> from the highe$t Regions, to the$e $o low and elementa-
ry. And for that I think that we have $ufficiently demon$trated
the va$t difference that is between the arguments of tho$e A$tro-
nomers, and of this their Antagoni$t, it will be convenient that we
leave this particular, and return to our principal matter; in which
there pre$ents it $elf to our con$ideration the annual motion com-
monly a$cribed to the Sun, but by <I>Aristarchus Samius</I> fir$t of all,
and after by <I>Copernicus</I> taken from the Sun, and transferred upon
the Earth; again$t which Hypothe$is, methinks I $ee <I>Simplicius</I> to
come $trongly provided, and particularly with the $word and
<foot>buckler</foot>
<p n=>293</p>
buckler of the little Treati$e of <I>Conclu$ions,</I> or Di$qui$itions Ma-
thematical, the oppugnations of which it would be good to be-
gin to produce.</P>
<P>SIMP. I will, if you $o plea$e, re$erve them to the la$t, as tho$e
that are of late$t invention.</P>
<P>SALV. It will therefore be nece$$ary, that in conformity to the
method hitherto ob$erved, you do orderly, one by one, propound
the arguments, on the contrary, a$well of <I>Ari$totle,</I> as of the o-
ther ancients, which $hall be my task al$o, that $o nothing may e-
$cape our $trict con$ideration and examination; and likewi$e <I>Sa-
gredus,</I> with the vivacity of his wit, $hall interpo$e his thoughts, as
he $hall finde him$elf inclined.</P>
<P>SAGR. I will do it with my wonted freedome; and your com-
mands $hall oblige you to excu$e me in $o doing.</P>
<P>SALV. The favour will challenge thanks, and not an excu$e.
But now let <I>Simplicius</I> begin to propo$e tho$e doubts which di$-
$wade him from believing that the Earth, in like manner, as the
other pianets, may move round about a fixed centre.</P>
<P>SIMP. The fir$t and greate$t difficulty is the repugnance and
incompatibility that is between being in the centre, and being far
from it; for if the Terre$trial Globe were to move in a year by
the circumference of a circle, that is, under the Zodiack, it is im-
po$$ible that it $hould, at the $ame time, be in the centre of the Zo-
diack; but that the Earth is in the $aid centre <I>Aristotle, Ptolomy,</I>
and others have many wayes proved.</P>
<P>SALV. You very well argue, aud there is no que$tion but that
one that would make the Earth to move in the circumference of a
circle, mu$t fir$t of nece$$ity prove, that it is not in the centre of
that $ame circle; it now followeth, that we enquire, whether the
Earth be, or be not in that centre, about which, I $ay, that it tur-
neth, and you $ay that it is fixed; and before we $peak of this, it
is likewi$e nece$$ary that we declare our $elves, whether you and I
have both the $ame conceit of this centre, or no. Therefore tell
me, what and where is this your intended centre?</P>
<P>SIMP. When I $peak of the centre, I mean that of the Uni-
ver$e, that of the World, that of the Starry Sphere.</P>
<P>SALV. Although I might very rationally put it in di$pute, whe-
ther there be any $uch centre in nature, or no; being that neither
<marg><I>It hath not been
hitherto proved by
any, whether the
World be finite or
infinite.</I></marg>
you nor any one el$e hath ever proved, whether the World be fi-
nite and figurate, or el$e infinite and interminate; yet neverthele$s
granting you, for the pre$ent, that it is finite, and of a terminate
Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre; it will be
requi$ite to $ee how credible it is that the Earth, and not rather
$ome other body, doth po$$e$$e the $aid centre.</P>
<P>SIMP. That the world is finite, terminato, and $pherical, <I>Ari-</I>
<foot><I>$totle</I></foot>
<p n=>294</p>
<I>$totle</I> proveth with an hundred demon$trations.</P>
<marg><I>The Demon$tra-
tions of</I> Ari$totle
<I>to Prove that the
Vniver$e is finite,
are all nullified by
denying it to be
moveable.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. All which in the end are reduced to one alone, and that
one to none at all; for if I deny his a$$umption, to wit, that the
Univer$e is moveable, all his demon$trations come to nothing, for
he onely proveth the Univer$e to be finite and terminate, for that
it is moveable. But that we may not multiply di$putes, let it be
granted for once, that the World is finite, $pherical, and hath
its centre. And $eeing that that centre and figure is argued from
its mobility, it will, without doubt, be very rea$onable, if from the
circular motions of mundane bodies we proceed to the particular
inve$tigation of that centres proper place: Nay <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
<marg><I>Ari$totle makes
that point to be the
centre of the Uni-
ver$e about which
all the Cele$tial
Spheres do revolve.</I></marg>
hath argued and determined in the $ame manner, making that
$ame to be the centre of the Univer$e about which all the C&oelig;le-
le$tial Spheres revolve, and in which he beleived the Terre$trial
Globe to have been placed. Now tell me <I>Simplicius,</I> if <I>Ari$totle</I>
<marg><I>A que$tion is

forced to receive
one of two propo$i-

admit.</I></marg>
$hould be con$trained by evident experience to alter in part this
his di$po$ure and order of the Univer$e, and confe$$e him$elf to
have been deceived in one of the$e two propo$itions, namely, ei-
ther in placing the Earth in the centre, or in $aying, that the
C&oelig;le$tial Spheres do move about that centre, which of the two
confe$$ions think you would he choo$e?</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe, that if it $hould $o fall out, the <I>Peripate-
ticks.</I></P>
<P>SALV. I do not ask the <I>Peripateticks,</I> I demand of <I>Ari$totle,</I>
for as to tho$e, I know very well what they would reply; they, as
ob$ervant and humble va$$als of <I>Ari$totle,</I> would deny all the ex-
periments and all the ob$ervations in the World, nay, would al$o
refu$e to $ee them, that they might not be forced to acknowledg
them, and would $ay that the World $tands as <I>Ari$totle</I> writeth,
and not as nature will have it, for depriving them of the $hield
of his Authority, with what do you think they would appear in the
field? Tell me therefore what you are per$waded <I>Ari$totle</I> him-
$elf would do in the ca$e.</P>
<P>SIMP. To tell you the truth, I know not how to re$olve
which of the two inconveniences is to be e$teemed the le$$er.</P>
<P>SALV. Apply not I pray you this term of inconvenience to a
thing which po$$ibly may of nece$$ity be $o. It was an inconveni-
ence to place the Earth in the centre of the C&oelig;le$tial revolutions;
but $eeing you know not to which part he would incline, I e-
$teeming him to be a man of great judgment, let us examine
which of the two choices is the more rational, and that we will
hold that <I>Ari$totle</I> would have received. Rea$$uming therefore our
di$cour$e from the beginning, we $uppo$e with the good liking of
<I>Ari$totle,</I> that the World (of the magnitude of which we have
no $en$ible notice beyond the fixed $tars) as being of a $pherical
<foot>figure;</foot>
<p n=>295</p>
figure; and moveth circularly, hath nece$$arily, and in re$pect of
its figure a centre; and we being moreover certain, that within
the $tarry Sphere there are many Orbs, the one within another,
with their $tars, which likewi$e do move circulary, it is in di$pute
whether it is mo$t rea$onable to believe and to $ay that the$e con-
teined Orbs do move round the $aid centre of the World, or el$e
about $ome other centre far remote from that? Tell me now <I>Sim-
plicius</I> what you think concerning this particular.</P>
<P>SIMP. If we could $tay upon this onely $uppo$ition, and that
<marg><I>Its more ratio-
nal that the Orb
conteining, and the
parts conteined, do
move all about one
centre, than uoon
divers.</I></marg>
we were $ure that we might encounter nothing el$e that might di-
$turb us, I would $ay that it were much more rea$onable to af-
firm that the Orb containing, and the parts contained, do all
move about one common centre, than about divers.</P>
<P>SALV. Now if it were true that the centre of the World is the
<marg><I>If the centre of
the World be the
$ame with that a-
bout which the via-
nees move the Sun
and not the Earth
is placed in it.</I></marg>
$ame about which the Orbs of mundane bodies, that is to $ay, of
the Planets, move, it is mo$t certain that it is not the Earth, but
the Sun rather that is fixed in the centre of the World. So that as
to this fir$t $imple and general apprehen$ion, the middle place
belongeth to the Sun, and the Earth is as far remote from the
centre, as it is from that $ame Sun.</P>
<P>SIMP. But from whence do you argue that not the Earth, but
the Sun is in the centre of the Planetary revolutions?</P>
<P>SALV. I infer the $ame from mo$t evident, and therefore ne-
ce$$arily concludent ob$ervations, of which the mo$t palpable to
<marg><I>Ob$ervations from
whence it is col-
lected that the Sun
and not the Earth
is in the centre of
the Cele$tial revo-
lutions.</I></marg>
exclude the Earth from the $aid centre, and to place the Sun
therein, are, the $eeing all the Planets one while neerer and ano-
ther while farther off from the Earth with $o great differences, that
for example, <I>Venus</I> when it is at the farthe$t, is $ix times more
remote from us, than when it is neere$t, and <I>Mars</I> ri$eth almo$t
eight times as high at one time as at another. See therefore whe-
ther <I>Ari$totle</I> was not $omewhat mi$taken in thinking that it was
at all times couidi$tant from us.</P>
<P>SIMP. What in the next place are the tokens that their moti-
ons are about the Sun?</P>
<P>SALV. It is argued in the three $uperiour planets <I>Mars, Jupi-
ter,</I> and <I>Saturn,</I> in that we find them alwayes neere$t to the
Earth when they are in oppo$ition to the Sun, and farthe$t off
when they are towards the conjunction, and this approximatian
and rece$$ion importeth thus much that <I>Mars</I> neer at hand, ap-
peareth very neer 60 times greater than when it is remote. As to
<marg><I>The mutation
of figure in</I> Venus
<I>argueth its motion
to be about the Sun.</I></marg>
<I>Venus</I> in the next place, and to <I>Mercury,</I> we are certain that
they revolve about the Sun, in that they never move far from
him, and in that we $ee them one while above and another while
<marg><I>The Moon can-
not $eperate from
the Earth.</I></marg>
below it, as the mutations of figure in <I>Venus</I> nece$$arily argueth.
Tonchiug the Moon it is certain, that $he cannot in any way
<foot>$e-</foot>
<p n=>296</p>
$eperate from the Earth, for the rea$ons that $hall be more di$tinct-
ly alledged hereafter.</P>
<P>SAGR. I expect that I $hall hear more admirable things that
depend upon this annual motion of the Earth, than were tho$e
dependant upon the diurnal revolution.</P>
<marg><I>The annual mo-
tion of the Earth
mixing with the
motions of the o-
ther Planets pro-
duce extravagant
appearances.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. You do not therein erre: For as to the operation of
the diurnal motion upon the Cele$tial bodies, it neither was, nor
can be other, than to make the Univer$e $eem to run precipitately
the contrary way; but this annual motion intermixing with the
particular motions of all the planets, produceth very many ex-
travagancies, which have di$armed and non-plu$t all the greate$t
Scholars in the World. But returning to our fir$t general appre-
hen$ions, I reply that the centre of the Cele$tial conver$ions of
the five planets <I>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus</I> and <I>Mercury,</I> is
the Sun; and $hall be likewi$e the centre of the motion of the
Earth, if we do but $ucceed in our attempt of placing it in Hea-
ven. And as for the Moon, this hath a circular motion about the
Earth, from which (as I $aid before) it can by no means alienate
it $elf, but yet doth it not cea$e to go about the Sun together with
the Earth in an annual motion.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not as yet very well apprehend this $tructure, but
it may be, that with making a few draughts thereof, one may bet-
ter and more ea$ily di$cour$e concerning the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. Tis very true: yea for your greater $atisfaction and ad-
mi<*>ation together, I de$ire you, that you would take the pains
to draw the $ame; and to $ee that although you think you do not
apprehend it, yet you very perfectly under$tand it; And onely
by an$wering to my interrogations you $hall de$igne it punctually.

Take therefore a $heet of paper and Compa$les; And let this
white paper be the immen$e expan$ion of the Univer$e; in which
you are to di$tribute and di$po$e its parts in order, according as
rea$on $hall direct you. And fir$t, in regard that without my in-
$truction you verily believe that the Earth is placed in this Uni-

tend it to to be placed, and mark it with $ome characters.</P>
<P>SIMP. Let this mark A be the place of the Terre$trial Globe.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well. I know $econdly, that you under$tand per-
fectly that the $aid Earth is not within the body of the Sun, nor
$o much as contiguous to it, but di$tant for $ome $pace from the
$ame, and therefore a$$ign to the Sun what other place you be$t
like, as remote from the Earth as you plea$e, and mark this in
like manner.</P>
<P>SIMP. Here it is done: Let the place of the Solar body
be O.</P>
<P>SALV. The$e two being con$tituted, I de$ire that we may
<foot>think</foot>
<p n=>297</p>
think of accomodating the body of <I>Venus</I> in $uch a manner that
its $tate and motion may agree with what $en$ible experiments do
$hew us; and therefore recall to mind that. which either by the
pa$t di$cour$es, or your own ob$ervations you have learnt to be-
fal that $tar, and afterwards a$$ign unto it that $tate which you
think agreeth with the $ame.</P>
<P>SIMP. Suppo$ing tho$e <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> expre$$ed by you, and
which I have likewi$e read in the little treati$e of Conclu$ions, to
<fig>
be true, namely, that that $tar never recedes from the Sun beyond
$uch a determinate $pace of 40 degrees or thereabouts, $o as that
it never cometh either to appo$ition with the Sun, or $o much as
to quadrature, or yet to the $extile a$pect; and more than that,
<marg>Venus <I>very greas
towards the re$pe-
ctive conjunction
and very $mall to-
wards the matu-
tine.</I></marg>
$uppo$ing that it $heweth at one time almo$t 40 times greater than
at another; namely, very great, when being retrograde, it goeth to
the ve$pertine conjnnction of the Sun, and very $mall when with a
<foot>Pp motion</foot>
<p n=>298</p>
motion $traight forwards, it goeth to the matutine conjunction;
and moreover it being true, that when it appeareth bigge it $hews
with a corniculate figure, and when it appeareth little, it $eems
perfectly round, the$e appearances, I $ay, being true, I do not $ee
how one can choo$e but affirm the $aid $tar to revolve in a circle a-
<marg>Venus <I>nece$$a-
rily proved to move
about the Sun.</I></marg>
bout the Sun, for that the $aid circle cannot in any wi$e be $aid
to encompa$$e or to contain the Earth within it, nor to be inferi-
our to the Sun, that is between it and the Earth, nor yet $upe-
riour to the Sun. That circle cannot incompa$$e the Earth, be-
cau$e <I>Venus</I> would then $ometimes come to oppofition with the
Sun; it cannot be inferiour, for then <I>Venus</I> in both its conjuncti-
ons with the Sun would $eem horned; nor can it be $uperiour,
for then it would alwayes appear round, and never cornicular;
and therefore for receit of it I will draw the circle CH, about
the Sun, without encompa$$ing the Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. Having placed <I>Venus,</I> it is requi$ite that you think of
<I>Mercury,</I> which, as you know, alwayes keeping about the Sun,
doth recede le$$e di$tance from it than <I>Venus</I>; therefore con$ider
with your $elf, what place is mo$t convenient to a$$ign it.</P>

cle within this of <I>Venus,</I> in like manner about the Sun, being
that of its greate$t vicinity to the Sun, an argument, an evidence
$ufficiently proving the vigour of its illumination, above that of

its Circle mu$t of nece$$ity encompa$s the Earth; But I $ee that it
mu$t nece$$arily encompa$s the Sun al$o, for coming to conjuncti-
on with the Sun, if it did not move over it, but were below it, it
would appear horned, as <I>Venus</I> and the Moon; but it $hews al-
wayes round, and therefore it is nece$$ary, that it no le$s includ-

eth the Sun within its circle than the Earth. And becau$e I re-
member that you did $ay, that when it is in oppo$ition with the
Sun, it $eems 60 times bigger than when it is in the conjunction,
me thinks that a Circle about the Centre of the Sun, and that tak-
eth in the earth, will very well agree with the$e <I>Ph&aelig;nomena,</I>
which I do note and mark D I, where <I>Mars</I> in the point D, is near
to the earth, and oppo$ite to the Sun; but when it is in the point

It remains now that you a$$ign a place to the Moon.</P>
<P>SIMP. Following the $ame Method (which $eems to me very
<marg><I>The Moons Orb
invironeth the

conclu$ive) in regard we $ee that the Moon cometh to conjunction
and oppo$ition with the Sun, it is nece$$ary to $ay, that its circle
encompa$$eth the Earth, but yet doth it not follow, that it mu$t
environ the Sun, for then at that time towards its conjunction, it
would not $eem horned, but alwayes round and full of Light.
Moreover it could never make, as it often doth, the Eclip$e of the
Sun, by interpo$ing betwixt it and us; It is nece$$ary therefore
to a$$ign it a circle about the Earth, which $hould be this N P, $o
that being con$tituted in P, it will appear from the Earth A, to be
in conjunction with the Sun, and placed in N, it appeareth oppo$ite
to the Sun, and in that po$ition it may fall under the Earths $ha-
dow, and be ob$cured.</P>
<P>SALV. Now, <I>Simplicius,</I> what $hall we do with the fixed
$tars? Shall we $uppo$e them $cattered through the immen$e abi$-
$es of the Univer$e, at different di$tances, from any one determi-
nate point; or el$e placed in a $uperficies $pherically di$tended a-
bout a centre of its own, $o that each of them may be equi-
di$tant from the $aid centre?</P>
<marg><I>The probable
$ituation of the
fixed $tars.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. I would rather take a middle way; and would a$$ign
them an Orb de$cribed about a determinate centre and comprized
within two $pherical $uperficies, to wit, one very high, and con-
cave, and the other lower, and convex, betwixt which I would
<marg><I>Which ought to
be accounted the
$phere of the Vm-
ver$e.</I></marg>
con$titute the innumerable multitude of $tars, but yet at divers al-
titudes, and this might be called the Sphere of the Univer$e, contein-
ing within it the Orbs of the planets already by us de$cribed.</P>
<P>SALV. But now we have all this while, <I>Simplicius,</I> di$po$ed the
mundane bodies exactly, according to the order of <I>Copernicus,</I>
and we have done it with your hand; and moreover to each of
them you have a$$igned peculiar motions of their own, except to
the Sun, the Earth, and $tarry Sphere; and to <I>Mercury</I> with
<I>Venus,</I> you have a$cribed the circular motion about the Sun,
<foot>Pp 2 with-</foot>
<p n=>300</p>
without encompa$$ing the Earth; about the $ame Sun you make
the three $uperiour Planets <I>Mars, Jupiter,</I> and <I>Saturn,</I> to move,
comprehending the Earth within their circles. The Moon in the
next place can move in no other manner than about the Earth,
without taking in the Sun, and in all the$e motions you agree al$o
with the $ame <I>Copernicus.</I> There remains now three things to be
decided between the Sun, the Earth, and fixed $tars, namely,
<marg><I>Re$t, the annual
motion and the di-
urnal ought to be
di$tributed be-
twixt the Sun,
Earth, and Fir-
mament.</I></marg>
Re$t, which $eemeth to belong to the Earth; the annual motion
under the Zodiack, which appeareth to pertain to the Sun; and the
diurnal motion, which $eems to belong to the Starry Sphere, and
to be by that imparted to all the re$t of the Univer$e, the Earth
excepted, And it being true that all the Orbs of the Planets, I
<marg><I>In a moveable
$phere, it $eemeth
more vea$onable
that its centre be
$table, than any o-
ther of its parts.</I></marg>
mean of <I>Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,</I> and <I>Saturn,</I> do move
about the Sun as their centre; re$t $eemeth with $o much more
rea$on to belong to the $aid Sun, than to the Earth, in as much
as in a moveable Sphere, it is more rea$onable that the centre
$tand $till, than any other place remote from the $aid centre; to
the Earth therefore, which is con$tituted in the mid$t of move-
able parts of the Univer$e, I mean between <I>Venus</I> and <I>Mars,</I> one
of which maketh its revolution in nine moneths, and the other in
two years, may the motion of a year very commodiou$ly be a$-
<marg><I>Granting to the
Earth the annual,
it mu$t of nece$$ity
al$o have the diur-
nal motion a$$ign-
ed to it.</I></marg>
$igned, leaving re$t to the Sun. And if that be $o, it followeth
of nece$$ary con$equence, that likewi$e the diurnal motion be-
longeth to the Earth; for, if the Sun $tanding $till, the Earth
$hould not revolve about its $elf, but have onely the annual mo-
tion about the Sun, our year would be no other than one day and
one night, that is $ix moneths of day, and $ix moneths of night,
as hath already been $aid. You may con$ider withal how commo-
diou$ly the precipitate motion of 24 hours is taken away from
the Univer$e, and the fixed $tars that are $o many Suns, are made
in conformity to our Sun to enjoy a perpetual re$t. You $ee more-
over what facility one meets with in this rough draught to render
the rea$on of $o great appearances in the Cele$tial bodies.</P>
<P>SAGR. I very well perceive that facility, but as you from this
$implicity collect great probabilities for the truth of that Sy$tem,
others haply could make thence contrary deductions; doubting,
not without rea$on, why that $ame being the ancient Sy$teme of
<I>Pythagoreans,</I> and $o well accommodated to the <I>Ph&aelig;nomena,</I>
hath in the $ucce$$ion of $o many thou$and years had $o few fol-
lowers, and hath been even by <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf refuted, and
$ince that <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf hath had no better fortune.</P>
<P>SALV. If you had at any time been a$$aulted, as I have been,
many and many a time, with the relation of $uch kind of frivolous
rea$ons, as $erve to make the vulgar contumacious, and difficult to
be per$waded to hearken, (I will not $ay to con$ent) to this novel-
<foot>ty,</foot>
<p n=>301</p>
ty, I believe that you wonder at the paucity of tho$e who are fol-
lowers of that opinion would be much dimini$hed. But $mall re-
<marg><I>Di$cour$es more
than childi$h, $erve
to keep fools in the
opinion of the
Earths $tability.</I></marg>
gard in my judgement, ought to be had of $uch thick $culs, as think
it a mo$t convincing proof to confirm, and $teadfa$tly $ettle them
in the belief of the earths immobility, to $ee that if this day they
cannot Dine at <I>Con$tantinople,</I> nor Sup in <I>Jappan,</I> that then the
Earth as being a mo$t grave body cannot clamber above the Sun,
and then $lide headlong down again; Of $uch as the$e I $ay,
who$e number is infinite, we need not make any reckoning, nor
need we to record their foolieries, or to $trive to gain to our $ide
as our partakers in $ubtil and $ublime opinions, men in who$e de-
finition the kind onely is concerned, and the difference is wanting.
Moreover, what ground do you think you could be able to gain,
with all the demon$trations of the World upon brains $o $tupid,
as are not able of them$elves to know their down right follies? But
my admiration, <I>Sagredus,</I> is very different from yours, you won-
der that $o few are followers of the <I>Pythagorean</I> Opinion; and I
am amazed how there could be any yet left till now that do em-
brace and follow it: Nor can I $ufficiently admire the eminencie of
<marg><I>A declaration
of the improbabi-
lity of</I> Copernicus
<I>his opinion.</I></marg>
tho$e mens wits that have received and held it to be true, and with
the $prightline$$e of their judgements offered $uch violence to their
own $ences, as that they have been able to prefer that which their
rea$on dictated to them, to that which $en$ible experiments re-
pre$ented mo$t manife$tly on the contrary. That the rea$ons again$t
the Diurnal virtiginous revolution of the Earth by you already ex-
amined, do carry great probability with them, we have already
$een; as al$o that the <I>Ptolomaicks,</I> and <I>Ari$totelicks,</I> with all their
Sectators did receive them for true, is indeed a very great argument
of their efficacie; but tho$e experiments which apertly contradict
the annual motion, are of yet $o much more manife$tly repugnant,
<marg><I>Rea$ons and di$-
cour$e in</I> Ari$tar-
cus <I>and</I> Coperni-
cus <I>prevailed over
manife$t $ence.</I></marg>
that (I $ay it again) I cannot find any bounds for my admiration,
how that rea$on was able in <I>Ari$tarchus</I> and <I>Copernicus,</I> to com-
m&igrave;t $uch a rape upon their Sences, as in de$pight thereof, to make
her $elf mi$tre$s of their credulity.</P>
<P>SAGR. Are we then to have $till more of the$e $trong oppo$iti-
ons again$t this annual motion?</P>
<P>SALV. We are, and they be $o evident and $en$ible, that if a
$ence more $ublime and excellent than tho$e common and vulgar,
did not take part with rea$on, I much fear, that I al$o $hould have
been much more aver$e to the <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teem than I have been
$ince the time that a clearer lamp than ordinary hath enlightned
me.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now therefore <I>Salviatus,</I> let us come to joyn battail
for every word that is $pent on any thing el$e, I take to be ca$t a-
way.</P>
<foot>SALV.</foot>
<p n=>302</p>
<P>SALV. I am ready to $erve you. You have already $een me
draw the form of the <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teme; again$t the truth of
<marg>Mars <I>makes an
hot a$$ault upon the</I>
Copernican <I>Sy-
$teme.</I></marg>
which <I>Mars</I> him$elf, in the fir$t place, makes an hot charge; who, in
ca$e it were true, that its di$tances from the earth $hould $o much
vary, as that from the lea$t di$tance to the greate$t, there were
twice as much difference, as from the earth to the Sun; it would be
nece$$ary, that when it is neare$t unto us, its <I>di$cus</I> would $hew
more than 60. times bigger than it $eems, when it is farthe$t from
us; neverthele$s that diver$ity of apparent magnitude is not to be
$een, nay in its oppo$ition with the Sun, when its neare$t to the
Earth, it doth not $hew $o much as quadruple and quintuple in
bigne$s, to what it is, when towards the conjunction it cometh to
be occulted under the Suns rayes. Another and greater difficulty
doth <I>Venus</I> exhibit; For if revolving about the Sun, as <I>Copernicus</I>
<marg><I>The</I> Ph&aelig;nome-
na <I>of</I> Venus <I>appear
contrary to the Sy-
$teme of</I> Coperni-
cus.</marg>
affirmeth, it were one while above, &amp; another while below the $ame,
receding and approaching to us $o much as the Diameter of the cir-
cle de$cribed would be, at $uch time as it $hould be below the Sun,
and neare$t to us, its <I>di$cus</I> would $hew little le$s than 40 times big-
ger than when it is above the Sun, near to its other conjunction; yet
neverthele$$e, the difference is almo$t imperceptible Let us add an-
<marg><I>Another diffi-
culty rai$ed by</I> Ve-
nus <I>again$t</I> Coper-
nicus.</marg>
other difficulty, that in ca$e the body of <I>Venus</I> be of it $elf dark, and
onely $hineth as the Moon, by the illumination of the Sun, which
$eemeth mo$t rea$onable; it would $hew forked or horned at $uch
time as it is under the Sun, as the Moon doth when $he is in like
manner near the Sun; an accident that is not to be di$covered in
her. Whereupon <I>Copernicus</I> affirmeth, that either $he is light of
<marg>Venus, <I>according
to</I> Copernicus, <I>ei-
ther lucid in it
$elf, or el$e of a
tran$parent $ub-
$tance.</I></marg>
her $elf, or el$e that her $ub$tance is of $uch a nature, that it can
imbue the Solar light, and tran$mit the $ame through all its whole
depth, $o as to be able to appear to us alwayes $hining; and in this
manner <I>Copernicus</I> excu$eth the not changing figure in <I>Venus</I>: but
of her $mall variation of Magnitude, he maketh no mention at all;
<marg>Copernicus <I>$peak-
eth nothing of the
$mall variation of
bigne$s in</I> Venus
<I>and in</I> Mars.</marg>
and much le$s of <I>Mars</I> than was needful; I believe as being una-
ble $o well as he de$ired to $alve a <I>Ph&aelig;nomenon</I> $o contrary to his
Hypothe$is, and yet being convinced by $o many other occurrences
and rea$ons he maintained, and held the $ame Hypothe$is to be true.
Be$ides the$e things, to make the Planets, together with the Earth,
to move above the Sun as the Centre of their conver$ions, and the
<marg><I>The moon much
di$turbeth the or-
der of the other
Planets.</I></marg>
Moon onely to break that order, and to have a motion by it $elf
about the earth; and to make both her, the Earth, and the whole
Elementary <I>Sphere,</I> to move all together about the Sun in a year,
this $eemeth to pervert the order of this Sy$teme, which rendreth
it unlikely and fal$e. The$e are tho$e difficulties that make me
wonder how <I>Aristarchus</I> and <I>Copernicus,</I> who mu$t needs have ob-
$erved them, not having been able for all that to $alve them, have
yet notwith$tanding by other admirable occurrences been induced
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>303</p>
to con$ide $o much in that which rea$on dictated to them, as that
they have con$idently affirmed that the $tructure of the Univer$e
could have no other figure than that which they de$igned to them-
$elves. There are al$o $everal other very $erious and curious doubts,
not $o ea$ie to be re$olved by the middle $ort of wits, but yet pe-
netrated and declared by <I>Coperninus,</I> which we $hall defer till by
and by, after we have an$wered to other objections that $eem to
make again$t this opinion. Now coming to the declarations and
an$wers to tho$e three before named grand Objections, I $ay, that
the two fir$t not onely contradict not the <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teme, but
<marg><I>An$wers to the
three first objecti-
ons again$t the</I> Co-
pernican <I>Sy$teme.</I></marg>
greatly and ab$olutely favour it; For both <I>Mars</I> and <I>Venus</I> $eems
unequal to them$elves, according to the proportions a$$igned; and
<I>Venus</I> under the Sun $eemeth horned, and goeth changing figures
in it $elf exactly like the Moon.</P>
<P>SAGR. But how came this to be concealed from <I>Copernicus,</I>
and revealed to you?</P>
<P>SALV. The$e things cannot be comprehended, $ave onely by
the $en$e of $eeing, the which by nature was not granted to man
$o perfect, as that it was able to attain to the di$covery of $uch dif-
ferences; nay even the very in$trument of $ight is an impediment
to it $elf: But $ince that it hath plea$ed God in our age to vouch-
$afe to humane ingenuity, $o admirable an invention of perfecting
our $ight, by multiplying it four, $ix, ten, twenty, thirty, and four-
ty times, infinite objects, that either by rea$on of their di$tance, or
for their extream $mallne$$e were invi$ible unto us, have by help
of the Tele$cope been rendered vi$ible.</P>
<P>SAGR. But <I>Venus</I> and <I>Mars</I> are none of the objects invi$ible
for their di$tance or $mallne$$e, yea, we do di$cern them with our
bare natural $ight; why then do we not di$tingui$h the differences
of their magnitudes and figures?</P>
<P>SALV. In this, the impediment of our very eye it $elf hath a
<marg><I>Therea$on whence
it happens that</I> Ve-
nus <I>and</I> Mars <I>do
not appear to vary
magnitude $o much
as is requi$ite.</I></marg>
great $hare, as but even now I hinted, by which the re$plendent and
remote objects are not repre$ented to us $imple and pure; but gives
them us fringed with $trange and adventitious rayes, $o long and
den$e, that their naked body $heweth to us agrandized ten, twen-
ty, an hundred, yea a thou$and times more than it would appear, if
the capillitious rayes were taken away.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now I remember that I have read $omething on this
$ubject, I know not whether in the Solar Letters, or in the <I>Sag-
giatore</I> of our common Friend, but it would be very good, a$well
for recalling it into my memory, as for the information of <I>Simpli-
cius,</I> who it may be never $aw tho$e writings, that you would de-
clare unto us more di$tinctly how this bu$ine$$e $tands, the know-
ledge whereof I think to be very nece$$ary for the a$$i$ting of us to
under$tand that of which we now $peak.</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>304</p>
<P>SIMP. I mu$t confe$$e that all that which <I>Salviatus</I> hath $po-
ken is new unto me, for truth is, I never have had the curio$ity to
read tho$e Books, nor have I hitherto given any great credit to
the Tele$cope newly introduced; rather treading in the $teps of o-
<marg><I>The operations of
the Tele$cope ac-
counted fallacies by
the</I> Peripateticks.</marg>
ther <I>Peripatetick</I> Philo$ophers my companions, I have thought
tho$e things to be fallacies and delu$ions of the Chry$tals, which
others have $o much admired for $tupendious operations: and
therefore if I have hitherto been in an errour, I $hall be glad to be
freed from it, and allured by the$e novelties already heard from
you, I $hall the more attentively hearken to the re$t.</P>
<P>SALV. The confidence that the$e men have in their own ap-
prehen$ivene$$e, is no le$s unrea$onable than the $mall e$teem they
have of the judgment of others: yet its much that they $hould e-
$teem them$elves able to judge better of $uch an in$trument, with-
out ever having made trial of it, than tho$e who have made, and
daily do make a thou$and experiments of the $ame: But I pray
you, let us leave this kind of pertinacious men, whom we can-
not $o much as tax without doing them too great honour. And re-
<marg><I>Shining objects
$eem environed
with adventitious
rayes.</I></marg>
turning to our purpo$e, I $ay, that re$plendent objects, whether
it is that their light doth refract on the humidity that is upon the
pupils, or that it doth reflect on the edges of the eye-browes, dif-
fu$ing its reflex rayes upon the $aid pupils, or whether it is for $ome
other rea$on, they do appear to our eye, as if they were environ'd
with new rayes, and therefore much bigger than their bodies
would repre$ent them$elves to us, were they dive$ted of tho$e ir-
<marg><I>The rea$on why
luminous bodies ap-
pear enlarged
much the more, by
how much they are
le$$er.</I></marg>
radiations. And this aggrandizement is made with a greater and
greater proportion, by how much tho$e lucid objects are le$$er and
le$$er; in the $ame manner for all the world, as if we $hould $up-
po$e that the augmentation of $hining locks were <I>v.g.</I> four inches,
which addition being made about a circle that hath four inches di-
ameter would increa$e its appearance to nine times its former big-
ne$$e: but---------</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe you would have $aid three times; for adding
four inches to this $ide, and four inches to that $ide of the diame-
ter of a circle, which is like wi$e four inches, its quantity is there-
by tripled, and not made nine times bigger.</P>
<P>SALV. A little more <I>Geometry</I> would do well, <I>Simplicius.</I>
<marg><I>Superficial fi-
gures encrea$<*>ing
proportion &agrave;ouble to
their lines.</I></marg>
True it is, that the diameter is tripled, but the $uperficies, which is
that of which we $peak, increa$eth nine times: for you mu$t know,
<I>Simplicius,</I> that the $uperficies of circles are to one another, as
the $quares of their diameters; and a circle that hath four inches
diameter is to another that hath twelve, as the $quare of four to
the $quare of twelve; that is, as 16. is to 144 and therefore it $hall
be increa$ed nine times, and not three; this, by way of adverti$e-
ment to <I>Simplicius.</I> And proceeding forwards, if we $hould add
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>305</p>
the $aid irradiation of four inches to a circle that hath but two in-
ches of diameter onely, the diameter of the irradiation or Gar-
land would be ten inches, and the $uperficial content of the circle
would be to the <I>area</I> of the naked body, as 100. to 4. for tho$e
are the $quares of 10. and of 2. the agrandizement would there-
fore be 25. times $o much; and la$tly, the four inches of hair or
fringe, added to a $mall circle of an inch in diameter, the $ame
would be increa$ed 81. times; and $o continually the augmenta-
tions are made with a proportion greater and greater, according
as the real objects that increa$e, are le$$er and le$$er.</P>
<P>SAGR. The doubt which puzzled <I>Simplicius</I> never troubled
me, but certain other things indeed there are, of which I de$ire
a more di$tinct under$tanding; and in particular, I would know up-
on what ground you affirm that the $aid agrandizement is alwayes
equal in all vi$ible objects.</P>
<marg><I>Objects the more
vigorous they are
in light, the more
they do $eem to in-
crea$e.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. I have already declared the $ame in part, when I $aid,
that onely lucid objects $o increa$ed, and not the ob$cure; now I
adde what remaines, that of the re$plendent objects tho$e that are
of a more bright light, make the reflection greater and more re-
$plendent upon our pupil; whereupon they $eem to augment
much more than the le$$e lucid: and that I may no more inlarge
my $elf upon this particular, come we to that which the true Mi-
$tris of <I>Astronomy,</I> Experience, teacheth us. Let us this evening,
when the air is very ob$cure, ob$erve the $tar of <I>Jupiter</I>; we
$hall $ee it very glittering, and very great; let us afterwards look
<marg><I>An ea$ie expe-
riment that $hew-
eth the increa$e in
the $tars, by means
of the adventitious
rays.</I></marg>
through a tube, or el$e through a $mall trunk, which clutching the
hand clo$e, and acco$ting it to the eye, we lean between the palm
of the hands and the fingers, or el$e by an hole made with a $mall
needle in a paper; and we $hall $ee the $aid $tar dive$ted of its
beams, but $o $mall, that we $hall judge it le$$e, even than a $ixti-
eth part of its great glittering light $een with the eye at liberty:
we may afterwards behold the <I>Dog-$tars</I> beautiful and bigger than
<marg>Jupiter <I>augments
le$$e than the</I> Dog-
$tar.</marg>
any of the other fixed $tars, which $eemeth to the bare eye no
great matter le$$e than <I>Jupiter</I>; but taking from it, as before, the
irradiation, its <I>Di$cus</I> will $hew $o little, that it will not be
thought the twentieth part of that of <I>Jupiter,</I> nay, he that hath not
very good eyes, will very hardly di$cern it; from whence it may
be rationally inferred, that the $aid $tar, as having a much more
lively light than <I>Jupiter,</I> maketh its irradiation greater than <I>Jupi-
ter</I> doth his. In the next place, as to the irradiation of the Sun
and Moon, it is as nothing, by means of their magnitude, which
<marg><I>The</I> Sun <I>and</I>
Moon <I>increa$e lis-
tle.</I></marg>
po$$e$$eth of it $elf alone $o great a $pace in our eye, that it lea-
veth no place for the adventitious rayes; $o that their faces $eem
clo$e clipt, and terminate. We may a$$ure our $elves of the $ame
truth by another experiment which I have often made triall of;
<foot>Qq we</foot>
<p n=>306</p>
<marg><I>It is $een by ma-
nife$t experience,
that the more
$plendid bodies do
much more irradi-
ate than the le$$e
lucid.</I></marg>
we may a$$ure our $elves, I $ay, that bodies $hining with mo$t&verbar; live-
ly light do irradiate, or beam forth rayes more by far than tho$e
that are of a more langui$hing light. I have many times $een <I>Ju-
piter</I> and <I>Venus</I> together twenty or thirty degrees di$tant from the
Sun, and the air being very dark, <I>Venus</I> appeared eight or ten
times bigger than <I>Jupiter,</I> being both beheld by the eye at liber-
ty; but being beheld afterwards with the Tele$cope, the <I>Di$cus</I>
of <I>Jupiter</I> di$covered it $elf to be four or more times greater than
that of <I>Venus,</I> but the vivacity of the $plendour of <I>Venus</I> was in-
comparably bigger than the langui$hing light of <I>Jupiter</I>; which
was only becau$e of <I>Jupiters</I> being far from the Sun, and from us;
and <I>Venus</I> neer to us, and to the Sun. The$e things premi$ed, it
will not be difficult to comprehend, how Mars, when it is in oppo-
$ition to the Sun, and therefore neerer to the Earth by $even times,
and more, than it is towards the conjunction, cometh to appear
$carce four or five times bigger in that $tate than in this, when as it
$hould appear more than fifty times $o much; of which the only
irradiation is the cau$e; for if we dive$t it of the adventitious
rayes, we $hall find it exactly augmented with the due proportion:
but to take away the capillitious border, the Tele$cope is the be$t
<marg><I>The</I> Tele$cope
<I>is the be$t means to
take away the ir-
radiations of the
Stars.</I></marg>
and only means, which inlarging its <I>Di$cus</I> nine hundred or a
thou$and times, makes it to be $een naked and terminate, as that
of the Moon, and different from it $elf in the two po$itions, ac-
<marg><I>Another $econd
rea$on of the $mall
apparent increa$e
of</I> Venus.</marg>
cording to its due proportions to an hair. Again, as to <I>Venus,</I>
that in its ve$pertine conjunction, when i<*> is below the Sun, ought
to $hew almo$t fourty times bigger than in the other matutine con-
junction, and yet doth not appear $o much as doubled; it happen-
eth, be$ides the effect of the irradiation, that it is horned; and its
cre$cents, be$ides that they are $harp, they do receive the Suns light
obliquely, and therefore emit but a faint $plendour; $o that as
being little and weak, its irradiation becometh the le$$e ample
and vivacious, than when it appeareth to us with its Hemi$phere all
$hining: but now the Tele$cope manife$tly $hews its hornes to

<P>SALV. You argue very well; but you know that the principal
$cope of <I>A$tronomers,</I> is to render only rea$on for the appearances
in the C&aelig;le$tial Bodies, and to them, and to the motions of the
Stars, to accomodate $uch $tructures and compo$itions of Circles,
that the motions following tho$e calculations, an$wer to the $aid
appearances, little $crupling to admit of $ome exorbitances, that
indeed upon other accounts they would much $tick at. And <I>Co-</I>
<marg>Copernicus <I>re-
$tored A$tronomy
upon the $uppo$iti-
ous of</I> Ptolomy:</marg>
<I>pernic us</I> him$elf writes, that he had in his fir$t $tudies re$tored the
Science of <I>A$tronomy</I> upon the very $uppo$itions of <I>Ptolomy,</I> and
in $uch manner corrected the motions of the Planets, that the
computations did very exactly agree with the <I>Ph&aelig;nomena,</I> and
the <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> with the $upputations, in ca$e that he took the
Planets $everally one by one. But he addeth, that in going a-
bout to put together all the $tructures of the particular Fabricks,
there re$ulted thence a Mon$ter and <I>Chim&aelig;ra,</I> compo$ed of mem-
bers mo$t di$proportionate to one another, and altogether incom-
patible; So that although it $atisfied an <I>A$tronomer</I> meerly <I>A-

<marg><I>What moved</I> Co-
pernicus <I>to e$ta-

<I>A$tronomer Phylo$ophical.</I> And becau$e he very well under-
$tood, that if one might $alve the C&aelig;le$tial appearances with fal$e
a$$umptions in nature, it might with much more ea$e be done by
true $uppo$itions, he $et him$elf diligently to $earch whether a-
ny among$t the antient men of fame, had a$cribed to the World
any other $tructure, than that commonly received by <I>Ptolomy</I>;
and finding that $ome <I>Pythagoreans</I> had in particular a$$igned
the Diurnal conver$ion to the Earth, and others the annual mo-
tion al$o, he began to compare the appearances, and particulari-
<foot>ties</foot>
<p n=>309</p>
ties of the Planets motions, with the$e two new $uppo$itions, all
which things jumpt exactly with his purpo$e; and $eeing the whole
corre$pond, with admirable facility to its parts, he imbraced this
new Sy$teme, and it took up his re$t.</P>
<P>SIMP. But what great exorbitancies are there in the <I>Ptolo-
maick</I> Sy$teme, for which there are not greater to be found in this
of <I>Copernicus</I>?</P>
<P>SALV. In the <I>Ptolomaick Hypothe$is</I> there are di$ea$es, and in

that are in the Sy-

the <I>Copernican</I> their cures. And fir$t will not all the Sects of
<I>Phylo$ophers,</I> account it a great inconvenience, that a body na-
turally moveable in circumgyration, $hould move irregularly upon
its own Centre, and regularly upon another point? And yet
there are $uch deformed motions as the$e in the <I>Ptolom&aelig;an</I> Hypo-
the$is, but in the <I>Copernican</I> all move evenly about their own
Centres. In the <I>Ptolomaick,</I> it is nece$$ary to a$$ign to the C&aelig;-
le$tial bodies, contrary motions, and to make them all to move,
from Ea$t to We$t, and at the $ame time, from We$t to Ea$t;
But in the <I>Copernican,</I> all the C&aelig;le$tial revolutions are towards
one onely way, from We$t to Ea$t. But what $hall we $ay of
the apparent motion of the Planets, $o irregular, that they not on-
ly go one while $wift, and another while $low, but $ometimes
wholly $eace to move; and then after a long time return back a-
gain? To $alve which appearances <I>Ptolomie</I> introduceth very great
<I>Epicicles,</I> accommodating them one by one to each Planet, with
$ome rules of incongruous motions, which are all with one $in-
gle motion of the Earth taken away. And would not you, <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> call it a great ab$urditie, if in the <I>Ptolomaick</I> Hypothe-
$is, in which the particular Planets, have their peculiar Orbs a$-
$igned them one above another, one mu$t be frequently forced
to $ay, that <I>Mars,</I> con$tituted above the Sph&aelig;re of the Sun, doth
$o de$cend, that breaking the Solar Orb, it goeth under it, and
approacheth neaer to the Earth, than to the Body of the Sun,
and by and by immea$urably a$cendeth above the $ame? And
yet this, and other exorbitancies are remedied by the Soul and
fingle annual motion of the Earth.</P>

annual Orb of the Earth let us take certain equal arches, B C,

of <I>Jupiter</I> let us make certain other arches, pa$$ed in the $ame
times in which the Earth pa$$eth hers, which let be B C, C D,
D E, E F, F G, G H, H I, I K, K L, L M, which $hall each be
proportionally le$$e than the$e marked in the Earths Orb, like
as the motion of <I>Jupiter</I> under the Zodiack is $lower than the
annual. Suppo$ing now, that when the Earth is in B, <I>Jupiter</I> is
in B, it $hall appear to us in the Zodiack to be in P, de$cribing
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>311</p>
the right line B B P. Next $uppo$e the Earth to be moved from
B to C, and <I>Jupiter</I> from B to C, in the $ame time; <I>Iupiter</I>
$hall appear to have pa$$ed in the Zodiack to Q, and to have
moved $traight forwards, according to the order of the $ignes
P Q. In the next place, the Earth pa$$ing to D, and <I>Iupiter</I>
to D, it $hall be $een in the Zodiack in R, and from E, <I>Iupi-
ter</I> being come to E; will appear in the Zodiack in S, having
all this while moved right forwards. But the Earth afterwards
beginning to interpo$e more directly between <I>Iupiter</I> and the
Sun, $he being come to F, and <I>Iupiter</I> to F, he will appear in
T, to have already begun to return apparently back again un-
der the Zodiack, and in that time that the Earth $hall have pa$-
ed the arch E F, <I>Iupiter</I> $hall have entertained him$elf between
the points S T, and $hall have appeared to us almo$t motion-
le$$e and $tationary. The Earth being afterwards come to G,
and <I>Iupiter</I> to G, in oppo$ition to the Sun, it $hall be vi$ible in
the Zodiack at V, and much returned backwards by all the arch
of the Zodiack T V; howbeit that all the way pur$uing its even
cour$e it hath really gone forwards not onely in its own circle,
but in the Zodiack al$o in re$pect to the centre of the $aid Zodi-
ack, and to the Sun placed in the $ame. The Earth and <I>Iupiter</I>
again continuing their motions, when the Earth is come to H,
and <I>Iupiter</I> to H, it $hall $eem very much gone backward in the
Zodiack by all the arch V X. The Earth being come to I, and
<I>Iupiter</I> to I, it $hall be apparently moved in the Zodiack by the lit-
tle $pace X Y, and there it will $eem $tationary. When after-
wards the Earth $hall be come to K, and <I>Iupiter</I> to K; in the
Zodiack he $hall have pa$$ed the arch Y N in a direct motion;
and the Earth pur$uing its cour$e to L, $hall $ee <I>Iupiter</I> in L, in
the point Z. And la$tly <I>Iupiter</I> in M $hall be $een from the Earth
M, to have pa$$ed to A, with a motion $till right forwards; and
its whole apparent retrogadation in the Zodiack $hall an$wer to
the arch S Y, made by <I>Iupiter,</I> whil$t that he in his own circle
pa$$eth the arch E I, and the Earth in hers the arch E I. And

to many great per$onages, as he relates in the fir$t of his Letters
to <I>Marcus Vel$erus,</I> ^{*} Sheriffe of <I>Augu$ta.</I> He was the
fir$t that again$t the opinions of the too timorous and too jealous
<marg>* Duumviro.</marg>
a$$ertors of the Heavens inalterability, affirmed tho$e $pots to be
matters, that in $hort times were produced and di$$olved: for as
to place, they were contiguous to the body of the Sun, and re-
volved about the $ame; or el$e being carried about by the $aid
Solar body, which revolveth in it $elfe about its own Centre, in
the $pace almo$t of a moneth, do fini$h their cour$e in that time;
which motion he judged at fir$t to have been made by the Sun a-
bout an Axis erected upon the plane of the Ecliptick; in regard
that the arches de$cribed by the $aid $pots upon the <I>Di$cus</I> of the
Sun appear unto our eye right lines, and parallels to the plane of
the Ecliptick: which therefore come to be altered, in part, with
$ome accidental, wandring, and irregular motions, to which they
are $ubject, and whereby tumultuarily, and without any order
they $ucce$$ively change $ituations among$t them$elves, one
while crouding clo$e together, another while di$$evering, and
$ome dividing them$elves into many and very much changing fi-
gures, which, for the mo$t part, are very unu$ual. And albeit
tho$e $o incon$tant mutations did $omewhat alter the primary pe-

riodick cour$e of the $aid $pots, yet did they not alter the opini-
on of our friend, $o as to make him believe, that they were any
e$$ential and fixed cau$e of tho$e deviations, but he continued to
hold, that all the apparent alterations derived them$elves from
tho$e accidental mutations: in like manner, ju$t as it would hap-
pen to one that $hould from far di$tant Regions ob$erve the mo-
tion of our Clouds; which would be di$covered to move with a
mo$t $wift, great, and con$tant motion, carried round by the di-
urnal <I>Vertigo</I> of the Earth (if haply that motion belong to the
$ame) in twenty four hours, by circles parallel to the Equinocti-
al, but yet altered, in part, by the accidental motions cau$ed by
the winds, which drive them, at all adventures, towards different
quarters of the World. While this was in agitation, it came to
pa$s that <I>Vel$erus</I> $ent him two Letters, written by a certain per-
<marg>* This Authors

$on, under the feigned name of ^{*} <I>Apelles,</I> upon the $ubject of
the$e Spots, reque$ting him, with importunity, to declare his
thoughts freely upon tho$e Letters, and withall to let him know
what his opinion was touching the e$$ence of tho$e $pots; which his
reque$t he $atisfied in 3 Letters, $hewing fir$t of all howvain the
conjectures of <I>Apelles</I> were; &amp; di$covering, $econdly, his own opi-
nions; withal foretelling to him, that <I>Apelles</I> would undoubtedly
be better advi$ed in time, and turn to his opinion, as it afterwards
came to pa$s. And becau$e that our Academian (as it was al$o
the judgment of many others that were intelligent in Natures $e-
crets) thought he had in tho$e three Letters inve$tigated and de-
mon$trated, if not all that could be de$ired, or required by hu-
mane curio$ity, at lea$t all that could be attained by humane
rea$on in $uch a matter, he, for $ome time (being bu$ied in other
$tudies) intermitted his continual ob$ervations, and onely in com-
placency to $ome friend, joyned with him, in making now and
then an abrupt ob$ervation: till that he, and after $ome years,

we, being then at my ^{*} Country-$eat, met with one of the $olita-
ry Solar $pots very big, and thick, invited withal by a clear and
con$tant $erenity of the Heavens, he, at my reque$t, made ob$er-
vations of the whole progre$$e of the $aid $pot, carefully marking
upon a $heet of paper the places that it was in every day at the
time of the Suns coming into the Meridian; and we having found
that its cour$e was not in a right line, but $omewhat incurvated,
we came to re$olve, at la$t, to make other ob$ervations from time
to time; to which undertaking we were $trongly induced by a
conceit, that accidentally came into the minde of my Gue$t,
which he imparted to me in the$e or the like words.</P>
<P>In my opinion, <I>Philip,</I> there is a way opened to a bu$ine$s of

And he continued his di$cour$e to this purpo$e. If the Earths

were con$tituted in the centre of the $aid Ecliptick, and therein
revolved in its $elf, not about the Axis of the $aid Ecliptique
(which would be the Axis of the Earths annual motion) but up-
on one inclined, it mu$t needs follow, that $trange changes will
repre$ent them$elves to us in the apparent motions of the Solar
$pots, although the $aid Axis of the Sun $hould be $uppo$ed to
per$i$t perpetually and immutably in the $ame inclination, and in
one and the $ame direction towards the $elf-$ame point of the
Univer$e. Therefore the Terre$trial Globe in the annual motion
moving round it, it will fir$t follow, that to us, carried about by
the $ame, the cour$es of the $pots $hall $ometimes $eem to be
made in right lines, but this only twice a year, and at all other
times $hall appear to be made by arches in$en$ibly incurvated.
Secondly, the curvity of tho$e arches for one half of the year,
will $hew inclined the contrary way to what they will appear in
the other half; that is, for $ix moneths the convexity of the ar-
ches $hall be towards the upper part of the Solar <I>Di$cus,</I> and for
the other $ix moneths towards the inferiour. Thirdly, the $pots be-
ginning to appear, and (if I may $o $peak) to ri$e to our eye from
the left $ide of the Solar <I>Di$cus,</I> and going to hide them$elves
and to $et in the right $ide, the Oriental termes, that is, of their
fir$t appearings for $ix moneths, $hall be lower than the oppo$ite
termes of their occultations; and for other $ix moneths it $hall
happen contrarily, to wit, that the $aid $pots ri$ing from more e-
levated points, and from them de$cending, they $hall, in their
cour$es, go and hide them$elves in lower points; and onely for
two dayes in all the year $hall tho$e termes of ri$ings and $et-
tings be equilibrated: after which freely beginning by $mall de-
grees the inclination of the cour$es of the $pots, and day by day
growing bigger, in three moneths, it $hall arrive at its greate$t
obliquity, and from thence beginning to dimini$h, in $uch another
time it $hall reduce it $elf to the other <I>&AElig;quilibrium.</I> It $hall hap-
pen, for a fourth wonder, that the cour$e of the greate$t obli-
quity $hall be the $ame with the cour$e made by the right line,
and in the day of the Libration the arch of the cour$e $hall $eem
more than ever incurvated. Again, in the other times, accord-
ing as the pendency $hall $ucce$$ively dimini$h, and make its ap-
<foot>proach</foot>
<p n=>315</p>
proach towards the <I>&AElig;quilibrium,</I> the incurvation of the arches
of the cour$es on the contrary $hall, by degrees, increa$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. I confe$$e, <I>Salviatus,</I> that to interrupt you in your
Di$cour$e is ill manners, but I e$teem it no le$$e rudene$s to per-
mit you to run on any farther in words, whil$t they are, as the
$aying is, ca$t into the air: for, to $peak freely, I know not how
to form any di$tinct conceit of $o much as one of the$e conclu$i-
ons, that you have pronounced; but becau$e, as I thus general-
ly and confu$edly apprehend them, they hold forth things of ad-
mirable con$equence, I would gladly, $ome way or other, be
made to under$tand the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. The $ame that befalls you, befell me al$o, whil$t my
Gue$t tran$ported me with bare words; who afterwards a$$i$ted
my capacity, by de$cribing the bu$ine$$e upon a material In$tru-
<marg><I>The fir$t Ac-
cident to be ob$er-
ved in the motion
of the Solar $pots;
and con$equently

ment, which was no other than a $imple Sphere, making u$e of
$ome of its circles, but to a different purpo$e from that, to which
they are commonly applied. Now I will $upply the defect of
the Sphere, by drawing the $ame upon a piece of paper, as need
$hall require. And to repre$ent the fir$t accident by me propoun-
ded, which was, that the cour$es or journeys of the $pots, twice
a year, and no more, might be $een to be made in right lines, let
us $uppo$e this point O [<I>in Fig.</I> 4.] to be the centre of the grand
Orb, or, if you will, of the Ecliptick, and likewi$e al$o of the
Globe of the Sun it $elf; of which, by rea$on of the great di-
$tance that is between it and the Earth, we that live upon the
Earth, may $uppo$e that we $ee the one half: we will therefore
de$cribe this circle A B C D about the $aid centre O, which repre-
$enteth unto us the extream term that divideth and $eparates the
Hemi$phere of the Sun that is apparent to us, from the other that
is occult. And becau$e that our eye, no le$$e than the centre of
the Earth, is under$tood to be in the plane of the Ecliptick, in
which is likewi$e the centre of the Sun, therefore, if we $hould
fancy to our $elves the body of the Sun to be cut thorow by the
$aid plane, the $ection will appear to our eye a right line, which
let be B O D, and upon that a perpendicular being let fall AOC,
it $hall be the Axis of the $aid Ecliptick, and of the annual mo-
tion of the Terre$trial Globe. Let us next $uppo$e the Solar body
(without changing centre) to revolve in it $elf, not about the
Axis A O C (which is the erect Axis upon the plane of the E-
cliptick) but about one $omewhat inclined, which let be this
E O I, the which fixed and unchangeable Axis maintaineth it $elf
perpetually in the $ame inclination and direction towards the
$ame points of the Firmament, and of the Univer$e. And be-
cau$e, in the revolutions of the Solar Globe, each point of its $u-
perficies (the Poles excepted) de$cribeth the circumference of a
<foot>Rr 2 circle</foot>
<p n=>316</p>
circle, either bigger or le$$er, according as it is more or le$$e re-
mote from the $aid Poles, let us take the point F, equally di$tant
from them, and draw the diameter F O G, which $hall be perpen-
dicular to the Axis E I, and $hall be the diameter of the grand
circle de$cribed about the Poles E I. Suppo$ing not that the
Earth, and we with her be in $uch a place of the Ecliptick, that
the Hemi$phere of the Sun to us apparent is determin'd or bound-
ed by the circle A B C D, which pa$$ing (as it alwayes doth) by
the Poles A C, pa$$eth al$o by E I. It is manife$t, that the grand
circle, who$e diameter is FG, $hall be erect to the circle A B C D,
to which the ray that from our eye falleth upon the centre O, is
perpendicular; $o that the $aid ray falleth upon the plane of
the circle, who$e diameter is F G, and therefore its circumference
will appear to us a right line, and the $elf $ame with F G, where-
upon if there $hould be in the point F, a $pot, it comming after-
wards to be carried about by the Solar conver$ion, would, upon
the $urface of the Sun, trace out the circumference of that cir-
cle, which $eems to us a right line. Its cour$e or pa$$age will
therefore $eem $traight. And $traight al$o will the motion of the
other $pots appear, which in the $aid revolution $hall de$cribe le$-
$er circles, as being all parallel to the greater, and to our eye
placed at an immen$e di$tance from them. Now, if you do but
con$ider, how that after the Earth $hall in $ix moneths have run
thorow half the grand Orb, and $hall be $ituate oppo$ite to that
Hemi$phere of the Sun, which is now occult unto us, $o as that
the boundary of the part that then $hall be $een, may be the $elf
$ame A B C D, which al$o $hall pa$$e by the Poles E I; you
$hall under$tand that the $ame will evene in the cour$es of the
$pots, as before, to wit, that all will appear to be made by right
lines. But becau$e that that accident takes not place, $ave one-
ly when the terminator or boundary pa$$eth by the Poles E I,
and the $aid terminator from moment to moment, by meanes of
the Earths annual motion, continually altereth, therefore its pa$-
$age by the fixed Poles E I, $hall be momentary, and con$equent-
ly momentary $hall be the time, in which the motions of tho$e
$pots $hall appear $traight. From what hath been hitherto $poken
one may comprehend al$o how that the apparition and beginning
of the motion of the $pots from the part F, proceeding towards
G, their pa$$ages or cour$es are from the left hand, a$cending to-
wards the right; but the Earth being placed in the part diame-
trically oppo$ite the appearance of the $pots about G, $hall $till
be to the left hand of the beholder, but the pa$$age $hall be de$-
cending towards the right hand F. Let us now de$cribe the Earth
te be $ituate one fourth part farther di$tant from its pre$ent $tate,
and let us draw, as in the other figure, the terminator A B C D,
<foot>[<I>as</I></foot>
<p n=>317</p>
[<I>as in Fig.</I> 5.] and the Axis, as before A C, by which the plane
of our Meridian would pa$$e, in which plane $hould al$o be the
Axis of the Suns revolution, with its Poles, one towards us, that
is, in the apparent Hemi$phere, which Pole we will repre$ent by
the point E, and the other $hall fall in the occult Hemi$phere,
and I mark it I. Inclining therefore the Axis E I, with the $upe-
riour part E, towards us, the great circle de$cribed by the Suns
conver$ion, $hall be this B F D G, who$e half by us $een, name-
ly B F D, $hall no longer $eem unto us a right line, by rea$on the
Poles E I are not in the circumference A B C D, but $hall appear
incurvated, and with its convexity towards the inferiour part C.
And it is manife$t, that the $ame will appear in all the le$$er cir-
cles parallel to the $ame B F D. It is to be under$tood al$o, that
when the Earth $hall be diametrically oppo$ite to this $tate, $o
that it $eeth the other Hemi$phere of the Sun, which now is hid,
it $hall of the $aid great circle behold the part D G B incurved,
with its convexity towards the $uperiour part A; and the cour-
$es of the $pots in the$e con$titutions $hall be fir$t, by the arch
B F D, and afterwards by the other D G B, and the fir$t appari-
tions and ultimate occultations made about the points B and D,
$hall be equilibrated, and not tho$e that are more or le$$e eleva-
ted than the$e. But if we con$titute the Earth in $uch a place
of the Ecliptick, that neither the boundary A B C D, nor the
Meridian A C, pa$$eth by the Poles of the Axis E I, as I will $hew
you anon, drawing this other Figure [<I>viz. Fig.</I> 6.] wherein the
apparent or vi$ible Pole E falleth between the arch of the termi-
nator A B, and the $ection of the Meridian A C; the diameter
of the great circle $hall be F O G, and the apparent $emicircle
F N G, and the occult $emicircle G S F, the one incurvated with
its convexity N towards the inferiour part, and the other al$o
bending with its convexity S towards the upper part of the Sun.
The ingre$$ions and exitions of the $pots, that is, the termes F
and G $hall not be librated, as the two others B and D; but F
$hall be lower, and G higher: but yet with le$$er difference
than in the fir$t Figure. The arch al$o F N G $hall be incurva-
ted, but not $o much as the precedent B F D; $o that in this po-
$ition the pa$$ages or motions of the $pots $hall be a$cendent
from the left $ide F, towards the right G, and $hall be made by
curved lines. And imagining the Earth to be con$tituted in the
po$ition diametrically oppo$ite; $o that the Hemi$phere of the
Sun, which was before the occult, may be the apparent, and ter-
minated by the $ame boundary A B C D, it will be manife$tly
di$cerned, that the cour$e of the $pots $hall be by the arch G S F,
beginning from the upper point G, which $hall then be likewi$e
from the left hand of the beholder, and going to determine, de$-
<foot>cending</foot>
<p n=>318</p>
$cending towards the right, in the point F. What I have hi-
therto $aid, being under$tood, I believe that there remains no
difficulty in conceiving how $rom the pa$$ing of the terminator of
the Solar Hemi$pheres by the Poles of the Suns conver$ion, or
neer or far from the $ame, do ari$e all the differences in the appa-
rent cour$es of the $pots; $o that by how much the more tho$e Poles
$hall be remote from the $aid terminator, by $o much the more $hall
tho$e cour$es be incurvated, and le$$e oblique; whereupon at
the $ame di$tance, that is, when tho$e Poles are in the $ection of
the Meridian, the incurvation is reduced to the greate$t, but the
obliquity to the lea$t, that is to <I>&AElig;quilibrium,</I> as the $econd of
the$e three la$t figures [<I>viz. Fig.</I> 5.] demon$trateth. On the
contrary, when the Poles are in the terminator, as the fir$t of
the$e three figures [<I>viz. Fig.</I> 4.] $heweth the inclination is at
the greate$t, but the incurvation at the lea$t, and reduced to
rectitude. The terminator departing from the Poles, the curvity
begins to grow $en$ible, the obliquity all the way encrea$ing,
and the inclination growing le$$er.</P>
<P>The$e are tho$e admirable and extravagant mutations, that my
Gue$t told me would from time to time appear in the progre$$es
of the Solar $pots, if $o be it $hould be true that the annual mo-
tion belonged to the Earth, and that the Sun being con$tituted
in the centre of the Ecliptick, were revolved in it $elf upon an
Axis, not erect, but inclined to the Plane of the $aid Eclip-
tick.</P>
<P>SAGR. I do now very well apprehend the$e con$equences,
and believe that they will be better imprinted in my fancy, when
I $hall come to reflect upon them, accommodating a Globe to
tho$e inclinations, and then beholding them from $everal pla-
ces. It now remains that you tell us what followed afterwards
touching the event of the$e imaginary con$equences.</P>
<marg><I>The events be-
ing ob$erved, were
an$werable to the
predictions.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. It came to pa$$e thereupon, that continuing many $e-
veral moneths to make mo$t accurate ob$ervations, noting down
with great exactne$$e the cour$es or tran$itions of $undry $pots at
divers times of the year, we found the events punctually to cor-
re$pond to the predictions.</P>
<P>SAGR. <I>Simplicius,</I> if this which <I>Salviatus</I> $aith be true; (nor
can we di$tru$t him upon his word) the <I>Ptolomeans</I> and <I>Aristo-
teleans</I> hadneed of $olid arguments, $trong conjectures, and
well grounded experiments to counterpoi$e an objection of $o
much weight, and to $upport their opinion from its final over-
throw.</P>
<P>SIMP. Fair and $oftly good Sir, for haply you may not yet
be got $o far as you per$wade your $elf you are gone. And
though I am not an ab$olute ma$ter of the $ubject of that narra-
<foot>tion</foot>
<p n=>319</p>
tion given us by <I>Salviatus</I>; yet do I not find that my Logick,
<marg><I>Though the an-
nual motion a$$ign-
ed to the Earth an-
$werth to the</I> Ph&aelig;-
nomena <I>of the $o-
lar $pots, yet doth
it not follow by con-
ver$ion that from
the</I> Ph&aelig;nomena <I>of
the $pots one may
infor the annual
motion to belong to
the Earth.</I></marg>
whil$t I have a regard to form, teacheth me, that that kind of ar-
gumentation affords me any nece$$ary rea$on to conclude in fa-
vour of the <I>Copernican</I> Hypothe$is, that is, of the $tability of
the Sun in the centre of the Zodiack, and of the mobility of
the Earth under its circumference. For although it be true, that
the $aid conver$ion of the Sun, and cirnition of the Earth being
granted, there be a nece$$ity of di$cerning $uch and $uch $trange
extravagancies as the$e in the $pots of the Sun, yet doth it not
follow that arguing <I>per conver$um,</I> from finding $uch like un-
u$ual accidents in the Sun, one mu$t of nec$$ity conclude the
Earth to move by the circumference, and the Sun to be placed
in the centre of the Zodiack. For who $hall a$$ertain me that the
like irregularities may not as well be vi$ible in the Sun, it being
moveable by the Ecliptick, to the inhabitants of the Earth, it
being al$o immoveable in the centre of the $ame? Unle$$e you
demon$trate to me, that there can be no rea$on given for that ap-
pearance, when the Sun is made moveable, and the Earth $table,
I will not alter my opinion and belief that the Sun moveth, and
the Earth $tandeth $till.</P>
<P>SAGR. <I>Simplicius</I> behaveth him$elf very bravely, and argueth
very $ubtilly in defence of the cau$e of <I>Ari$totle</I> and <I>Ptolomy</I>;
and if I may $peak the truth, mythinks that the conver$ation of
<I>Salviatus,</I> though it have been but of $mall continuance, hath
much farthered him in di$cour$ing $ilogi$tically. An effect which
I know to be wrought in others as well as him. But as to finding
and judging whether competent rea$on may be rendered of the
apparent exorbitancies and irregularities in the motions of the
$pots, $uppo$ing the Earth to be immoveable, and the Sun
moveable, I $hall expect that <I>Salviatus</I> manife$t his opinion to
us, for it is very probable that he he hath con$idered of the
$ame, and collected together whatever may be $aid upon the
point.</P>
<P>SALV. I have often thought thereon, and al$o di$cour$ed
thereof with my Friend and Gue$t afore-named; and touching
what is to be produced by Philo$ophers and A$tronomers, in de-
fence of the ancient Sy$teme, we are on one hand certain, cer-
tain I $ay, that the true and pure <I>Peripateticks</I> laughing at $uch
<marg><I>The Pure</I> Peri-
patetick <I>Philo$o-
phers will laugh at
the $pots and their</I>
Ph&aelig;nomena, <I>as
illu$ions of the

Tele$cope.</I></marg>
as employ them$elves in $uch, to their thinking, in$ipid foole-
ries, will cen$ure all the$e <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> to be vain illu$ions of the
Chri$tals; and in this manner will with little trouble free them-
$elves from the obligation of $tudying any more upon the $ame.
Again, as to the A$tronomical Philo$ophers, after we have with
$ome diligence weighed that which may be alledged as a mean
between tho$e two others, we have not been able to find out an
<foot>an$wer</foot>
<p n=>320</p>
an$wer that $ufficeth to $atis$ie at once the cour$e of the $pots,
and the di$cour$e of the Mind. I will explain unto you $o much
as I remember thereof, that $o you may judge thereon as $eems
be$t unto you.</P>
<P>Suppo$ing that the apparent motions of the Solar $pots are the
$ame with tho$e that have been above declared, and $uppo$ing the
Earth to be immoveable in the centre of the Ecliptick, in who$e
circumference let the center of the Sun be placed; it is nece$$ary
that of all the differences that are $een in tho$e motions, the cau-
$es do re$ide in the motions that are in the body of the Sun:
Which in the fir$t place mu$t nece$$arily revolve in it $elf (<I>i. e.</I>
<marg><I>If the Earth be

about its own axis) carrying the $pots along therewith; which
$pots have been $uppo$ed, yea and proved to adhere to the So-
lar $uperficies. It mu$t $econdly be confe$t, that the Axis of the
Solar conver$ion is not parallel to the Axis of the Ecliptick, that
is as much as to $ay, that it is not perpendicularly erected upon
the Plane of the Ecliptick, becau$e if it were $o, the cour$es and
exitions of tho$e $pots would $eem to be made by right lines pa-
rallel to the Ecliptick. The $aid Axis therefore is inclining, in
regard the $aid cour$es are for the mo$t part made by curve lines.
It will be nece$$ary in the third place to grant that the inclinati-
on of this Axis is not fixed, and continually extended towards
one and the $ame point of the Univer$e, but rather that it doth
alwayes from moment to moment go changing its direction; for
if the pendency $hould always look towards the $elf $ame point,
the cour$es of the $pots would never change appearance; but
appearing at one time either right or curved, bending upwards
or downwards, a$cending or de$cending, they would appear
the $ame at all times. It is therefore nece$$ary to $ay, that the
$aid Axis is convertible; and is $ometimes found to be in the
Plane of the circle that is extreme, terminate, or of the vi$ible
Hemi$phere, I mean at $uch time as the cour$es of the $pots
$eem to be made in right lines, and more than ever pendent,
which happeneth twice a year; and at other times found to be in
the Plane of the Meridian of the Ob$ervator, in $uch $ort that
one of its Poles falleth in the vi$ible Hemi$phere of the Sun, and
the other in the occult; and both of them remote from the ex-
treme points, or we may $ay, from the poles of another Axis of
the Sun, which is parallel to the Axis of the Ecliptick; (which
$econd Axis mu$t nece$$arily be a$$igned to the Solar Globe) re-
mote, I $ay, as far as the inclination of the Axis of the revolution
of the $pots doth import; and moreover that the Pole falling in
the apparent Hemi$phere, is one while in the $uperiour, another
while in the inferiour part thereof; for that it mu$t be $o, the
cour$es them$elves do manife$tly evince at $uch time as they are
<foot>equi-</foot>
<p n=>321</p>
equilibrated, and in their greate$t curvity, one while with
their convexity towards the upper part, and another while
towards the lower part of the Solar <I>Di$cus.</I> And becau$e
tho$e po$itions are in continuall alteration, making the in-
clinations and incurvations now greater, now le$$er, and $ome-
times reduce them$elves, the fir$t $ort to perfect libration, and
the $econd to perfect perpendicularity, it is nece$$ary to a$$ert that
the $elf $ame Axis of the monethly revolution of the $pots hath
a particular revolution of its own, whereby its Poles de$cribe
two circles about the Poles of another Axis, which for that rea-
$on ought (as I have $aid) to be a$$igned to the Sun, the $emidi-
ameter of which circles an$wereth to the quantity of the incli-
nation of the $aid Axis. And it is nece$$ary, that the time of its
Period be a year; for that $uch is the time in which all the ap-
pearances and differences in the cour$es of the $pots do return.
And that the revolution of this Axis, is made about the Poles of
the other Axis parallel to that of the Ecliptick, &amp; not about other
points, the greate$t inclinations and greate$t incurvations, which
are always of the $ame bigne$s, do clearly prove. So that finally, to
maintain the Earth fixed in the centre, it will be nece$$ary to a$-
$ign to the Sun, two motions about its own centre, upon two $eve-
ral Axes, one of which fini$heth its conver$ion in a year, and the
other in le$$e than a moneth; which a$$umption $eemeth, to my
under$tanding, very hard, and almo$t impo$$ible; and this de-
pendeth on the nece$$ity of a$cribing to the $aid Solar body two
other motions about the Earth upon different Axes, de$cribing
with one the Ecliptick in a year, and with the other forming $pi-
rals, or circles parallel to the Equinoctial one every day:
whereupon that third motion which ought to be a$$igned to the
Solar Clobe about its own centre (I mean not that almo$t
monethly, which carrieth the $pots about, but I $peak of that o-
ther which ought to pa$$e thorow the Axis and Poles of this
monethly one) ought not, for any rea$on that I $ee, to fini$h its
Period rather in a year, as depending on the annual motion by
the Ecliptick, than in twenty four hours, as depending on the
diurnal motion upon the Poles of the Equinoctial. I know, that
what I now $peak is very ob$cure, but I $hall make it plain unto
you, when we come to $peak of the third motion annual, a$$ign-
ed by <I>Copernicus,</I> to the Earth. Now if the$e four motions, $o
incongruous with each other, (all which it would be nece$$ary to
a$$ign to the $elf $ame body of the Sun) may be reduced to one
$ole and $imple motion, a$$igned the Sun upon an Axis that never
changeth po$ition, and that without innovating any thing in the
motions for $o many other cau$es a$$igned to the Terre$trial
Globe, may $o ea$ily $alve $o many extravagant appearances in
<foot>S$ the</foot>
<p n=>322</p>
the motions of the Solar $pots, it $eemeth really that $uch an
Hypothe$is ought not to be rejected.</P>
<P>This, <I>Simplicius,</I> is all that came into the minds of our friend,
and my $elf, that could be alledged in explanation of this <I>Ph&aelig;no-
menon</I> by the <I>Copernicans,</I> and by the <I>Ptolom&aelig;ans,</I> in defence
of their opinions. Do you inferre from thence what your judg-
ment per$wades you.</P>
<P>SIMP. I acknowledge my $elf unable to interpo$e in $o im-
portant a deci$ion: And, as to my particular thoughts, I will
$tand neutral; and yet neverthele$$e I hope that a time will
come, when our minds being illumin'd by more lofty contempla-
tions than the$e our humane rea$onings, we $hall be awakened
and freed from that mi$t which now is $o great an hinderance to
our $ight.</P>
<P>SAGR. Excellent and pious is the coun$el taken by <I>Simpli-
cius,</I> and worthy to be entertained and followed by all, as that
which being derived from the highe$t wi$dome and $upreame$t
authority, may onely, with $ecurity be received. But yet $o far
as humane rea$on is permitted to penetrate, confining my $elf
within the bounds of conjectures, and probable rea$ons, I will
$ay a little more re$olutely than <I>Simplicius</I> doth, that among$t
all the ingenuous $ubtilties I ever heard, I have never met with
any thing of greater admiration to my intellect, nor that hath
more ab$olutely captivated my judgment, (alwayes excepting
pure Geometrical and Arithmetical Demon$trations) than the$e
two conjectures taken, the one from the $tations and retrograda-
tions of the five Planets, and the other from the$e irregularities of
the motions of the Solar $pots: and becau$e they $eem to me $o
ea$ily and clearly to a$$ign the true rea$on of $o extravagant ap-
pearances, $hewing as if they were but one $ole $imple motion,
mixed with $o many others, $imple likewi$e, but different from
each other, without introducing any difficulty, rather with obvi-
ating tho$e that accompany the other Hypothe$is; I am think-
ing that I may rationally conclude, that tho$e who contumaci-
ou$ly with$tand this Doctrine, either never heard, or never un-
der$tood, the$e $o convincing arguments.</P>
<P>SALV. I will not a$cribe unto them the title either of con-
vincing, or non-convincing; in regard my intention is not, as I
have $everal times told you, to re$olve any thing upon $o high a
que$tion, but onely to propo$e tho$e natural and A$tronomicall
rea$ons, which, for the one and other Sy$teme, may be produced
by me, leaving the determination to others; which determinati-
on cannot at la$t, but be very manife$t: for one of the two po$i-
tions being of nece$$ity to be true, and the other of nece$$ity to

<I>cius</I> did bring with him.</P>
<P>SIMP. Here is the Book, and this is the place where the Au-
thor fir$t briefly de$cribeth the Sy$teme of the world, according
to the Hypothe$is of <I>Copernicus,</I> $aying, <I>Terram igitur un&agrave; cum
Luna, totoque hoc elementari mundo</I> Copernicus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SALV. Forbear a little, <I>Simplicius,</I> for methinks that this
Authour, in this fir$t entrance, $hews him$elf to be but very ill
ver$t in the Hypothe$is which he goeth about to confute, in re-
gard, he $aith that <I>Copernicus</I> maketh the Earth, together with
the Moon, to de$cribe the ^{*} grand Orb in a year moving from
Ea$t to We$t; a thing that as it is fal$e and impo$$ible, $o was it
<marg>* <*> the Ecliptick</marg>
never affirmed by <I>Copernicus,</I> who rather maketh it to move the
contrary way, I mean from We$t to Ea$t, that is, according to
the order of the Signes; whereupon we come to think the $ame
to be the annual motion of the Sun, con$tituted immoveable in
the centre of the Zodiack. See the too adventurous confidence
of this man; to undertake the confutation of anothers Doctrine,
and yet to be ignorant of the primary fundamentals; upon which
his adver$ary layeth the greate$t and mo$t important part of all
the Fabrick. This is a bad beginning to gain him$elf credit
with his Reader; but let us go on.</P>
<P>SIMP. Having explained the Univer$al Sy$teme, he beginneth
to propound his objections again$t this annual motion: and
the fir$t are the$e, which he citeth Ironically, and in deri$ion of
<marg><I>In$tances of a
certain Book Iro-
nically propounded
again$t</I> Coperni-
cus.</marg>
<I>Copernicus,</I> and of his followers, writing that in this phanta$tical
Hypothe$is of the World one mu$t nece$$arily maintain very
gro$$e ab$urdities; namely, that the Sun, <I>Venus,</I> and <I>Mercury</I>
are below the Earth; and that grave matters go naturally up-
wards, and the light downwards; and that <I>Chri$t,</I> our Lord and
Redeemer, a$cended into Hell, and de$cended into Heaven, when
he approached towards the Sun, and that when <I>Jo$huah</I> com-
manded the Sun to $tand $till, the Earth $tood $till, or the Sun
moved a contrary way to that of the Earth; and that when the
Sun is in <I>Cancer,</I> the Earth runneth through <I>Capricorn</I>; and that
the <I>Hyemal</I> (or Winter) Signes make the Summer, and the
<I>&AElig;$tival</I> Winter; and that the Stars do not ri$e and $et to
the Earth, but the Earth to the Stars; and that the Ea$t begin-
neth in the We$t, and the We$t in the Ea$t; and, in a word,
that almo$t the whole cour$e of the World is inverted.</P>
<P>SALV. Every thing plea$eth me, except it be his having inter-
<foot>S$ 2 mixed</foot>
<p n=>324</p>
mixed places out of the $acred Scriptures (alwayes venerable, and
to be rever'd) among$t the$e, but two $currilous fooleries, and
attempting to wound with holy Weapons, tho$e who Philo$o-
phating in je$t, and for diverti$ement, neither affirm nor deny,
but, $ome pre$uppo$als and po$itions being a$$umed, do famili-
arly argue.</P>
<P>SIMP. Truth is, he hath di$plea$ed me al$o, and that not a
little; and e$pecially, by adding pre$ently after that, howbeit,
the <I>Copernichists</I> an$wer, though but very impertinently to the$e
and $uch like other rea$ons, yet can they not reconcile nor an$wer
tho$e things that follow.</P>
<P>SALV. This is wor$e than all the re$t; for he pretendeth to
have things more efficacious and concludent than the Authorities
of the $acred Leaves; But I pray you, let us reverence them,
and pa$$e on to natural and humane rea$ons: and yet if he give
us among$t his natural arguments, things of no more $olidity,
than tho$e hitherto alleadged, we may wholly decline this under-
taking, for I as to my own parricular, do not think it fit to $pend
words in an$wering $uch trifling impertinencies. And as to what
he $aith, that the <I>Copernicans</I> an$wer to the$e objections, it is
mo$t fal$e, nor may it be thought, that any man $hould $et him
$elf to wa$t his time $o unprofitably.</P>
<marg><I>Suppo$ing the
annual motion to
belong to the Earth,
it followeth, that
one fixed Star, is
bigger than the
whole grand Orb.</I></marg>
<P>SIMP. I concur with you in the $ame judgment; therefore
let us hear the other in$tances that he brings, as much $tronger.
And ob$erve here, how he with very exact computations conclud-
eth, that if the grand Orb of the Earth, or the ecliptick, in which
<I>Copernicus</I> maketh it to run in a year round the Sun, $hould be
as it were, in$en$ible, in re$pect of the immen$itie of the Starry
Sph&aelig;re, according as the $aid <I>Copernicus,</I> $aith it is to be $up-
po$ed, it would be nece$$ary to grant and confirm, that the fixed
Stars were remote from us, an unconceivable di$tance, and that
the le$$er of them, were bigger than the whole grand Orb afore-
$aid, and $ome other much bigger than the whole Sph&aelig;re of <I>Sa-
turn</I>; Ma$$es certainly too exce$$ively va$t, unimaginable, and
incredible.</P>
<marg>Tycho <I>his Ar-
gument grounded
upon a fal$e Hypo-
the$is.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. I have heretofore $een $uch another objection brought
by <I>Tycho</I> again$t <I>Copernicus,</I> and this is not the fir$t time that I
have di$covered the fallacy, or, to $ay better, the fallacies of this
Argumemtation, founded upon a mo$t fal$e Hypothe$is, and upon
<marg><I>Litigious Lawyers
that are entertain-

a Piopo$ition of the $aid <I>Copernicus,</I> under$tood by his adver$a-

pleaders, who finding the flaw to be in the very merit of their
cau$e, keep to $ome one word, fallen unawares from the contra-
ry partie, and fly out into loud and tedious de$cants upon that.
But for your better information; <I>Copernicus</I> having declared

ons and retrogradations of the three uppermo$t in particular; he
$ubjoyneth, that this apparent mutation (which is di$cerned more
in <I>Mars</I> than in <I>Jupiter,</I> by rea$on <I>Jupiter</I> is more remote, and
yet le$$e in <I>Saturn,</I> by rea$on it is more remote than <I>Jupiter</I>) in
the fixed Stars, did remain imperceptible, by rea$on of their
immen$e remotene$$e from us, in compari$on of the di$tances of
<I>Jupiter</I> or <I>Saturn.</I> Here the Adver$aries of this opinion ri$e up,
and $uppo$ing that fore-named imperceptibility of <I>Copernicus,</I> as
if it had been taken by him, for a real and ab$olute thing of no-
thing, and adding, that a fixed Star of one of the le$$er magni-
tudes, is notwith$tanding perceptible, $eeing that it cometh un-
der the $ence of $eeing, they go on to calculate with the inter-
vention of other fal$e a$$umptions, and concluding that it is nece$-
$ary by the <I>Copernican</I> Doctrine, to admit, that a fixed Star is much
bigger than the whole grand Orb. Now to di$cover the vanity
<marg><I>Suppo$ing that a
fixed Star of the
$ixth magnitude is
no bigger than the</I>
Sun, <I>the diver$itie
which is $o great
in the Planets, in
the fixed Stars is
almost in$en$ible.</I></marg>
of this their whole proceeding, I $hall $hew that a fixed Star of the
$ixth magnitude, being $uppo$ed to be no bigger than the Sun,
one may thence conclude with true demon$trations, that the di-
$tance of the $aid fixed Stars from us, cometh to be $o great, that
the annual motion of the Earth, which cau$eth $o great and
notable variations in the Planets, appears $carce ob$ervable in
them; and at the $ame time, I will di$tinctly $hew the gro$s
fallacies, in the a$$umptions of <I>Copernicus</I> his Adver$aries.</P>
<P>And fir$t of all, I $uppo$e with the $aid <I>Copernicus,</I> and al$o
<marg><I>The di$tance of
the Sun, containeth</I>
1208 <I>Semid. of the
Earth.</I></marg>
with his oppo$ers, that the Semidiameter of the grand Orb, which
is the di$tance of the Earth from the Sun, containeth 1208 Semi-
diameters of the $aid Earth. Secondly, I premi$e with the allow-
ance afore$aid, and of truth, that the ^{*} apparent diameter of the

Sun in its mean di$tance, to be about half a degree, that is, 30.
<I>min. prim.</I> which are 1800. $econds, that is, 108000. thirds.
And becau$e the apparent Diameter of a fixed Star of the fir$t
<marg><I>The Diameter
of a fixed Star, of
the fir$t magni-
tude, and of one of

magnitude, is no more than 5. $econds, that is, 300. thirds, and
the Diameter of a fixed Star of the $ixth magnitude, 50. thirds,
(and herein is the greate$t errour of the <I>Anti-Copernicans</I>) There-
<marg><I>The apparent
Diameter of the

fore the Diameter of the Sun, containeth the Diameter of a
fixed Star of the $ixth magnitude 2160 times. And therefore
if a fixed Star of the $ixth magnitude, were $uppo$ed to be really
equal to the Sun, and not bigger, which is the $ame as to $ay, if
the Sun were $o far removed, that its Diameter $hould $eem to
be one of the 2160. parts of what it now appeareth, its di$tance
ought of nece$$ity to be 2160. times greater than now in effect it
is, which is as much as to $ay, that the di$tance of the fixed Stars
of the $ixth magnitude, is 2160. Semidiameters of the grand
<foot>Orb.</foot>
<p n=>326</p>

and the di$tance of the fixed Stars (as hath been $aid) 2160.
Semediameters of the grand Orb, therefore the Semediameter of
the Earth is much greater (that is almo$t double) in compari$on
of the grand Orb, than the Semediameter of the grand Orb, in

relation to the di$tance of the Starry Sph&aelig;re; and therefore the
variation of a$pect in the fixed Stars, cau$ed by the Diameter of
the grand Orb, can be but little more ob$ervable, than that which
is ob$erved in the Sun, occa$ioned by the Semediameter of the
Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. This is a great fall for the fir$t $tep.</P>

for the upholding the propo$ition of <I>Copernicus,</I> to be as big as
the whole grand Orb, onely by $uppo$ing it equal to the Sun,
which Sun is le$$e by far, than the hundred and $ix milionth part
of the $aid grand Orb, maketh the $tarry Sph&aelig;re $o great and high
as $ufficeth to overthrow the in$tance brought again$t the $aid <I>Co-
pernicus.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Favour me with this computation.</P>
<P>SALV. The $upputation is ea$ie and $hort. The Diameter of
the Sun, is eleven $emediameters of the Earth, and the Diameter

of the grand Orb, contains 2416. of tho$e $ame $emediameters,
by the a$cent of both parties; $o that the Diameter of the $aid
Orb, contains the Suns Diameter 220. times very near. And
becau$e the Spheres are to one another, as the Cubes of their Di-
ameters, let us make the Cube of 220. which is 106480000. and
we $hall have the grand Orb, an hundred and $ix millions, four
hundred and eighty thou$and times bigger than the Sun, to which
grand Orb, a $tar of the fixth magnitude, ought to be equal, ac-
cording to the a$$ertion of this Authour.</P>
<P>SAGR. The errour then of the$e men, con$i$teth in being ex-

indeed, I do very much admire how $o many <I>A$tronomers,</I> and
tho$e very famous, as are <I>Alfagranus, Albategnus, Tebizius,</I> and
much more modernly the <I>Tycho's</I> and <I>Clavius's,</I> and in $umm,
all the predece$$ors of our <I>Academian,</I> $hould have been $o gro$ly
mi$taken, in determining the magnitudes of all the Stars, as well

lacy; for I will not believe that they thought the true <I>Di$cus</I> to
be that which is $een in the ob$cure$t darkne$$es, and not that
which is di$cerned in the luminous <I>Medium</I>: for our lights, which
$een by night afar off appear great, and neer at hand $hew their
true lu$tre to be terminate and $mall, might have ea$ily have
made them cautious; nay, if I may freely $peak my thoughts, I
ab$olutely believe that none of them, no not <I>Tycho</I> him$elf, $o
accurate in handling A$tronomical In$truments, and that $o great
and accurate, without $paring very great co$t in their con$tru-
ction, did ever go about to take and mea$ure the apparent dia-
meter of any Star, the Sun and Moon excepted; but I think,
that arbitrarily, and as we $ay, with the eye, $ome one of the
more antient of them pronounced the thing to be $o and $o, and
that all that followed him afterwards, without more ado, kept
clo$e to what the fir$t had $aid; for if any one of them had ap-
plied him$elf to have made $ome new proof of the $ame, he would
doubtle$$e have di$covered the fraud.</P>
<P>SAGR. But if they wanted the Tele$cope, and you have al-
ready $aid, that our <I>Friend</I> with that $ame In$trument came to
the knowledge of the truth, they ought to be excu$ed, and not
accu$ed of ignorance.</P>
<P>SALV. This would hold good, if without the Tele$cope the
bu$ine$$e could not be effected. Its true, that this In$trument by
$hewing the <I>Di$cus</I> of the Star naked, and magnified an hun-
dred or a thou$and times, rendereth the operation much more ea-
$ie, but the $ame thing may be done, although not altogether $o
exactly, without the In$trument, and I have many times done
the $ame, and my method therein was this. I have cau$ed a rope
<marg><I>A way to mea-
$ure the apparent
diameter of a $tar.</I></marg>
to be hanged towards $ome Star, and I have made u$e of the
Con$tellation, called the <I>Harp,</I> which ri$eth between the North
and ^{*} North-ea$t, and then by going towards, and from
<marg>* Rendred in
Latine <I>Corum,</I> that
is to $ay, North-
we$t.</marg>
the $aid rope, interpo$ed between me and the Star, I have found
the place from whence the thickne$$e of the rope hath ju$t hid
the Star from me: this done, I have taken the di$tance from the
eye to the rope, which was one of the $ides including the angle
that was compo$ed in the eye, and ^{*} which in$i$teth upon the
<marg>* <I>i.e.</I> Is $ubten-
ded by.</marg>
thickne$$e of the rope, and which is like, yea the $ame with the
<foot>angle</foot>
<p n=>328</p>
angle in the Starry Sphere, that in$i$teth upon the diameter of
the Star, and by the proportion of the ropes thickne$$e to the
di$tance from the eye to the rope, by the table of Arches and
Chords, I have immediately found the quantity of the angle; u-
$ing all the while the wonted caution that is ob$erved in taking
angles $o acute, not to forme the concour$e of the vi$ive rayes
in the centre of the eye, where they are onely refracted, but
beyond the eye, where really the pupils greatne$$e maketh them
to concur.</P>
<P>SAGR. I apprehend this your cautelous procedure, albeit I
have a kind of h&aelig;$itancy touching the $ame, but that which mo$t
puzzleth me is, that in this operation, if it be made in the dark
of night, methinks that you mea$ure the diameter of the irradia-
ted <I>Di$cus,</I> and not the true and naked face of the Star.</P>
<P>SALV. Not $o, Sir, for the rope in covering the naked body
of the Star, taketh away the rayes, which belong not to it, but
to our eye, of which it is deprived $o $oon as the true <I>Di$cus</I>
thereof is hid; and in making the ob$ervation, you $hall $ee, how
unexpectedly a little cord will cover that rea$onable big body of
light, which $eemed impo$$ible to be hid, unle$$e it were with a
much broader Screene: to mea$ure, in the next place, and exa-
ctly to find out, how many of tho$e thickne$$es of the rope inter-
po$e in the di$tance between the $aid rope and the eye, I take not
onely one diameter of the rope, but laying many pieces of the
$ame together upon a Table, $o that they touch, I take with a
pair of Compa$$es the whole $pace occupied by fifteen, or twen-
ty of them, and with that mea$ure I commen$urate the di$tance
before with another $maller cord taken from the rope to the con-
cour$e of the vi$ive rayes. And with this $ufficiently-exact ope-
ration I finde the apparent diameter of a fixed Star of the fir$t
magnitude, commonly e$teemed to be 2 <I>min. pri.</I> and al$o 3 <I>min.
prim.</I> by <I>Tycho</I> in his <I>A$tronomical Letters, cap.</I> 167. to be no

more than 5 <I>$econds,</I> which is one of the 24. or 36. parts of what
they have held it: $ee now upon what gro$$e errours their Do-
ctrines are founded.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $ee and comprehend this very well, but before we
pa$$e any further, I would propound the doubt that ari$eth in
me in the finding the concour$e [or inter$ection] of the vi$ual
rayes beyond the eye, when ob$ervation is made of objects com-
prehended between very acute angles; and my $cruple proceeds
from thinking, that the $aid concour$e may be $ometimes more
remote, and $ometimes le$$e; and this not $o much, by meanes
of the greater or le$$er magnitude of the object that is beheld, as
becau$e that in ob$erving objects of the $ame bigne$$e, it $eems
to me that the concour$e of the rayes, for certain other re-
<foot>$pects</foot>
<p n=>329</p>
$pects ought to be made more and le$$e remote from the eye.</P>
<P>SALV. I $ee already, whither the apprehen$ion of <I>Sagredus,</I>
a mo$t diligent ob$erver of Natures $ecrets, tendeth; and I
<marg><I>The circle of the
pupil of the eye en-
largeth and con-
tracteth.</I></marg>
would lay any wager, that among$t the thou$ands that have ob-
$erved Cats to contract and inlarge the pupils of their eyes very
much, there are not two, nor haply one that hath ob$erved the
like effect to be wrought by the pupils of men in $eeing, whil$t
the <I>medium</I> is much or little illumin'd, and that in the open light
the circlet of the pupil dimini$heth con$iderably: $o that in loo-
king upon the face or <I>Di$cus</I> of the Sun, it is reduced to a $mall-
ne$$e le$$er than a grain of ^{*} <I>Panick,</I> and in beholding objects

$mall grain like to

that do not $hine, and are in a le$$e luminous <I>medium,</I> it is inlar-
god to the bigne$$e of a Lintel or more; and in $umme this
expan$ion and contraction differeth in more than decuple pro-
portion: From whence it is manife$t, that when the pupil is
much dilated, it is nece$$ary that the angle of the rayes con-
cour$e be more remote from the eye; which happeneth in be-
holding objects little luminated. This is a Doctrine which <I>Sa-
gredus</I> hath, ju$t now, given me the hint of, whereby, if we
were to make a very exact ob$ervation, and of great con$e-
quence, we are advertized to make the ob$ervation of that con-
cour$e in the act of the $ame, or ju$t $uch another operation; but
in this our ca$e, wherein we are to $hew the errour of <I>Astrono-
mers,</I> this accuratene$$e is not nece$$ary: for though we $hould,
in favour of the contrary party, $uppo$e the $aid concour$e to be
made upon the pupil it $elf, it would import little, their mi$take
being $o great. I am not certain, <I>Sagredus,</I> that this would have
been your objection.</P>
<P>SAGR. It is the very $ame, and I am glad that it was not al-
together without rea$on, as your concurrence in the $ame a$$u-
reth me; but yet upon this occa$ion I would willingly hear what
way may be taken to finde out the di$tance of the concour$e of
the vi$ual rayes.</P>
<P>SALV. The method is very ea$ie, and this it is, I take two
long^{*} labels of paper, one black, and the other white, and make
<marg>* Stri$ce.
<I>How to find the
di$tance of the rays
concour$e from the
pupil.</I></marg>
the black half as broad as the white; then I $tick up the white a-
gain$t a wall, and far from that I place the other upon a $tick, or
other $upport, at a di$tance of fifteen or twenty yards, and rece-
ding from this, $econd another $uch a $pace in the $ame right line,
it is very manife$t, that at the $aid di$tance the right lines will
concur, that departing from the termes of the breadth of the
white piece, $hall pa$$e clo$e by the edges of the other label pla-
ced in the mid-way; whence it followeth, that in ca$e the eye
were placed in the point of the $aid concour$e or inter$ection,
the black $lip of paper in the mid$t would preci$ely hide the op-
<foot>Tt po$ite</foot>
<p n=>330</p>
po$ite blank, if the $ight were made in one onely point; but if we
$hould find, that the edges of the white cartel appear di$covered,
it $hall be a nece$$ary argument that the vi$ual rayes do not i$$ue
from one $ole point. And to make the white label to be hid by
the black, it will be requi$ite to draw neerer with the eye:
Therefore, having approached $o neer, that the intermediate la-
bel covereth the other, and noted how much the required ap-
proximation was, the quantity of that approach $hall be the cer-
tain mea$ure, how much the true concour$e of the vi$ive rayes, is
remote from the eye in the $aid operation, and we $hall moreover
have the diameter of the pupil, or of that circlet from whence
the vi$ive rayes proceed: for it $hall be to the breadth of the
black paper, as is the di$tance from the concour$e of the lines,
that are produced by the edges of the papers to the place where
the eye $tandeth, when it fir$t $eeth the remote paper to be hid
by the intermediate one, as that di$tance is, I $ay, to the di$tance
that is between tho$e two papers. And therefore when we
would, with exactne$$e, mea$ure the apparent diameter of a Star,
having made the ob$ervation in manner, as afore$aid, it would be
nece$$ary to compare the diameter of the rope to the diameter of
the pupil; and having found <I>v.g.</I> the diameter of the rope to be
quadruple to that of the pupil, and the di$tance of the eye from
the rope to be, for example, thirty yards, we would $ay, that the
true concour$e of the lines produced from the ends or extremi-
ties of the diameter of the $tar, by the extremities of the dia-
meter of the rope, doth fall out to be fourty yards remote from
the $aid rope, for $o we $hall have ob$erved, as we ought, the pro-
portion between the di$tance of the rope from the concour$e of
the $aid lines, and the di$tance from the $aid concour$e to the
place of the eye, which ought to be the $ame that is between
the diameter of the rope, and diameter of the pupil.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have perfectly under$tood the whole bu$ine$$e, and
therefore let us hear what <I>Simplicius</I> hath to alledge in defence of
the <I>Anti-Copernicans.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. Albeit that grand and altogether incredible inconve-
nience in$i$ted upon by the$e adver$aries of <I>Copernicus</I> be much
moderated and abated by the di$cour$e of <I>Salviatus,</I> yet do I
not think it weakened $o, as that it hath not $trength enough left
to foil this $ame opinion. For, if I have rightly apprehended the
chief and ultimate conclu$ion, in ca$e, the $tars of the $ixth mag-
nitude were $uppo$ed to be as big as the Sun, (which yet I can
hardly think) yet it would $till be true, that the grand Orb [or
Ecliptick] would occa$ion a mutation and variation in the $tarry
Sphere, like to that which the $emidiameter of the Earth produ-
ceth in the Sun, which yet is ob$ervable; $o that neither that, no
<foot>nor</foot>
<p n=>331</p>
nor a le$$e mutation being di$cerned in the fixed Stars, methinks
that by this means the annual motion of the Earth is de$troyed
and overthrown.</P>
<P>SALV. You might very well $o conclude, <I>Simplicius,</I> if we
had nothing el$e to $ay in behalf of <I>Copernicus</I>: but we have
many things to alledge that yet have not been mentioned; and
as to that your reply, nothing hindereth, but that we may $up-
po$e the di$tance of the fixed Stars to be yet much greater than
that which hath been allowed them, and you your $elf, and who-
ever el$e will not derogate from the propo$itions admitted by
<I>Piolomy</I>'s $ectators, mu$t needs grant it as a thing mo$t requi$ite
to $uppo$e the Starry Sphere to be very much bigger yet than
that which even now we $aid that it ought to be e$teemed. For
<marg><I>All Astrono-
mers agree that
the greater magni-
tudes of the O<*>bes
is the cau$e of the
tardity of the con-
ver$ions.</I></marg>
all A$tronomers agreeing in this, that the cau$e of the greater
tardity of the Revolutions of the Planets is, the majority of
their Spheres, and that therefore <I>Saturn</I> is more flow than <I>Ju-
piter,</I> and <I>Jupiter</I> than the Sun, for that the fir$t is to de$cribe a
greater circle than the $econd, and that than this later, &amp;c. con-
$idering that <I>Saturn v.g.</I> the altitude of who$e Orb is nine times
higher than that of the Sun, and that for that cau$e the time of
one Revolution of <I>Saturn,</I> is thirty times longer than that of a
conver$ion of the Sun, in regard that according to the Doctrine
of <I>Ptolomy,</I> one conver$ion of the $tarry Sphere is fini$hed in
36000. years, whereas that of <I>Saturn</I> is con$ummate in thirty,
and that of the Sun in one, arguing with a like proportion, and
<marg><I>By another $up-
po$ition taken from
A$tronomers, the
di$tance of the fix-
ed Stars is calcu-
lated to be 10800
$emidiameters of
the grand Orb.</I></marg>
$aying, if the Orb of <I>Saturn,</I> by rea$on it is nine times bigger
than that of the Sun, revolves in a time thirty times longer, by
conver$ion, how great ought that Orb to be, which revolves
36000. times more $lowly? it $hall be found that the di$tance of
the $tarry Sphere ought to be 10800 $emidiameters of the grand
Orb, which $hould be full five times bigger than that, which even
now we computed it to be, in ca$e that a fixed Star of the $ixth
magnitude were equal to the Sun. Now $ee how much le$$er yet,
upon this account, the variation occa$ioned in the $aid Stars, by
the annual motion of the Earth, ought to appear. And if at the
$ame rate we would argue the di$tance of the $tarry Sphere from
<marg><I>By the proportion
of</I> Jupiter <I>and of</I>
Mais, <I>the $tarry
Sphere is found to
be yet more remote.</I></marg>
<I>Jupiter,</I> and from <I>Mars,</I> that would give it us to be 15000. and
this 27000 $emidiameters of the grand Orb, to wit, the fir$t
$even, and the $econd twelve times bigger than what the mag-
nitude of the fixed Star, $uppo$ed equal to the Sun, did make
it.</P>
<P>SIMP. Methinks that to this might be an$wered, that the mo-
tion of the $tarry Sphere hath, $ince <I>Ptolomy,</I> been ob$erved not
to be $o $low as he accounted it; yea, if I mi$take. not, I have
heard that <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf made the Ob$ervation.</P>

<P>SALV. You $ay very well; but you alledge nothing in that
which may favour the cau$e of the <I>Ptolom&oelig;ans</I> in the lea$t, who
did never yet reject the motion of 36000. years in the $tarry
Sphere, for that the $aid tardity would make it too va$t and im-
men$e. For if that the $aid immen$ity was not to be $uppo$ed in
Nature, they ought before now to to have denied a conver$ion
$o $low as that it could not with good proportion adapt it $elf,
$ave onely to a Sphere of mon$trous magnitude.</P>
<P>SAGR. Pray you, <I>Salviatus,</I> let us lo$e no more time in pro-
ceeding, by the way of the$e proportions with people that are apt
to admit things mo$t di$-proportionate; $o that its impo$$ible
to win any thing upon them this way: and what more di$propor-
tionate proportion can be imagined than that which the$e men
$wallow down, and admit, in that writing, that there cannot be a
more convenient way to di$po$e the C&oelig;le$tial Spheres, in order,
than to regulate them by the differences of the times of their pe-
riods, placing from one degree to another the more flow above
the more $wift, when they have con$tituted the Starry Sphere
higher than the re$t, as being the $lowe$t, they frame another
higher $till than that, and con$equently greater, and make it re-
volve in twenty four hours, whil$t the next below, it moves not
round under 36000. years?</P>
<P>SALV. I could wi$h, <I>Simplicius,</I> that $u$pending for a time
the affection rhat you bear to the followers of your opinion, you
would $incerely tell me, whether you think that they do in their
minds comprehend that magnitude, which they reject afterwards
as uncapable for its immen$ity to be a$cribed to the Univer$e.
For I, as to my own part, think that they do not; But believe,
<marg><I>Immen$e mag-
nitudes and num-
bers are incompre-
hen$ible by our un-
der$tanding.</I></marg>
that like as in the apprehen$ion of numbers, when once a man
begins to pa$$e tho$e millions of millions, the imagination is con-
founded, and can no longer form a conceipt of the $ame, $o it
happens al$o in comprehending immen$e magnitudes and di$tan-
ces; $o that there intervenes to the comprehen$ion an effect like
to that which befalleth the $en$e; For while$t that in a $erene
night I look towards the Stars, I judge, according to $en$e, that
their di$tance is but a few miles, and that the fixed Stars are not a
jot more remote than <I>Jupiter</I> or <I>Saturn,</I> nay than the Moon.
But without more ado, con$ider the controver$ies that have pa$t
between the A$tronomers and Peripatetick Philo$ophers, upon
occa$ion of the new Stars of <I>Ca$$iopeia</I> and of <I>Sagittary,</I> the A-
$tronomers placing them among$t the fixed Stars, and the Philo-
$ophers believing them to be below the Moon. So unable is our
$en$e to di$tingui$h great di$tances from the greate$t, though the$e
be in reality many thou$and times greater than tho$e. In a word,
I ask of thee, O fooli$h man! Doth thy imagination comprehend
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>333</p>
that va$t magnitude of the Univer$e, which thou afterwards judg-
e$t to be too immen$e? If thou comprehende$t it; wilt thou
hold that thy apprehen$ion extendeth it $elf farther than the Di-
vine Power? wilt thou $ay, that thou can$t imagine greater
things than tho$e which God can bring to pa$$e? But if thou
apprehende$t it not, why wilt thou pa$$e thy verdict upon things
beyond thy comprehen$ion?</P>
<P>SIMP. All this is very well, nor can it be denied, but that
Heaven may in greatne$$e $urpa$$e our imagination, as al$o that
God might have created it thou$ands of times va$ter than now it
is; but we ought not to grant any thing to have been made in
vain, and to be idle in the Univer$e. Now, in that we $ee this ad-
mirable order of the Planets, di$po$ed about the Earth in di$tan-
ces proportionate for producing their effects for our advantage,
to what purpo$e is it to interpo$e afterwards between the $ublime
Orb of <I>Saturn</I> and the $tarry Sphere, a va$t vacancy, without any
$tar that is $uperfluous, and to no purpo$e? To what end? For
who$e profit and advantage?</P>
<P>SALV. Methinks we arrogate too much to our $elves, <I>Simpli-
cius,</I> whil$t we will have it, that the onely care of us, is the ad-
&aelig;quate work, and bound, beyond which the Divine Wi$dome
and Power doth, or di$po$eth of nothing. But I will not con-
$ent, that we $hould $o much $horten its hand, but de$ire that we
may content our $elves with an a$$urance that God and Nature
<marg><I>God &amp; Nature

are $o imployed in the governing of humane affairs, that they
could not more apply them$elves thereto, although they had no
other care than onely that of mankind; and this, I think, I am
able to make out by a mo$t pertinent and mo$t noble example,
taken from the operation of the Suns light, which while$t it at-

$corcheth them, as if it had no more to do; yea, in ripening that
bunch of grapes, nay that one $ingle grape, it doth apply it $elf
$o, that it could not be more inten$e if the $um of all its bu$ine$s
had been the only maturation of that grape. Now if this grape
receiveth all that it is po$$ible for it to receive from the Sun, not
$uffering the lea$t injury by the Suns production of a thou$and
other effects at the $ame time; it would be either envy or folly
to blame that grape, if it $hould think or wi$h that the Sun would
onely appropriate its rayes to its advantage. I am confident that
nothing is omitted by the Divine Providence, of what concernes
the government of humane affairs; but that there may not be
other things in the Univer$e, that depend upon the $ame infinite
Wi$dome, I cannot, of my $elf, by what my rea$on holds forth
to me, bring my $elf to believe. However, if it were not $o,
yet $hould I not forbear to believe the rea$ons laid before me by
<foot>$ome</foot>
<p n=>334</p>

$hould tell me, that an immen$e $pace interpo$ed between the
Orbs of the Planets and the Starry Sphere, deprived of $tars and
idle, would be vain and u$ele$$e, as likewi$e that $o great an
immen$ity for receipt of the fixed $tars, as exceeds our utmo$t
comprehen$ion would be $uperfluous, I would reply, that it is
ra$hne$$e to go about to make our $hallow rea$on judg of the
Works of God, and to call vain and $uperfluous, what$oever

we know not what is $ub$ervient to us; and I hold it one of the
greate$t vanities, yea follies, that can be in the World, to $ay,
becau$e I know not of what u$e <I>Jupiter</I> or <I>Saturn</I> are to me, that
therefore the$e Planets are $uperfluous, yea more, that there are
no $uch things <I>in rerum natura</I>; when as, oh fooli$h man! I

the $pleen, the gall do $erve; nay I $hould not know that I have
a gall, $pleen, or kidneys, if in many de$ected Corps, they were
not $hewn unto me; and then onely $hall I be able to know what
the $pleen worketh in me, when it comes to be taken from me.
To be able to know what this or that C&oelig;le$tial body worketh in

$ume to $ay that the $pace which they call too va$t and u$ele$$e
between <I>Saturn</I> and the fixed $tars, is void of other mundane bo-

Medicean Planets, and the companions of <I>Saturn</I> came fir$t in-

by this rule the innumerable other fixed $tars had no exi$tence
before that men did look on them? and the cloudy con$tellati-
ons called <I>Nebulo$&oelig;</I> were at fir$t only white flakes, but afterwards
with the Tele$cope we made them to become con$tellations of

<P>SALV. It's to no purpo$e <I>Sagredus,</I> to $ally out any more into

de$igne of examining the validity of the rea$ons alledged on ei-

ment thereof when we have done, to $uch as are more knowing.
Returning therefore to our natural and humane di$qui$itions, I
<marg><I>Great, $mall,
immen$e,</I> &amp;c. <I>are
relative terms.</I></marg>
$ay, that great, little, immen$e, $mall, <I>&amp;c.</I> are not ab$olute,
but relative terms, $o that the $elf $ame thing compared with
divers others, may one while be called immen$e, and another
<foot>while</foot>
<p n=>335</p>
while imperceptible, not to $ay $mall. This being $o, I demand
in relation to what the Starry Sphere of <I>Copernicus</I> may be cal-
led over va$t. In my judgment it cannot be compared, or $aid
to be $uch, unle$$e it be in relation to $ome other thing of the
$ame kind; now let us take the very lea$t of the $ame kind,
<marg><I>Vanity of tho$e
mens di$cour $ewho
judg the $tarry
$phere too va$t in
the</I> Copernican
<I>Hypothe$is.</I></marg>
which $hall be the Lunar Orb; and if the Starry Orb may be $o
cen$ured to be too big in re$pect to that of the Moon, every o-
ther magnitude that with like or greater proportion exceedeth
another of the $ame kind, ought to be adjudged too va$t, and
for the $ame rea$on to be denied that they are to be found in the
World; and thus an Elephant, and a Whale, $hall without more
ado be condemned for <I>Chym&aelig;ra's,</I> and Poetical fictions, be-
cau$e that the one as being too va$t in relation to an Ant, which
is a Terre$trial animal, and the other in re$pect to the ^{*}Gudgeon,
<marg>* <I>Spilloncola,</I> which
is here put for the
lea$t of Fi$hes.</marg>
which is a Fi$h, and are certainly $een to be <I>in rerum natura,</I>
would be too immea$urable; for without all di$pute, the Ele-
phant and Whale exceed the Ant and Gudgeon in a much great-
er proportion than the Starry Sphere doth that of the Moon,
although we $hould fancy the $aid Sphere to be as big as the <I>Co-

Sphere of <I>Jupiter,</I> or that of <I>Saturn,</I> defigned for a receptacle
but for one $ingle $tar; and that very $mall in compari$on of one
of the fixed? Certainly if we $hould a$$ign to every one of the
fixed $tars for its receptacle $o great a part of the Worlds $pace,
it would be nece$$ary to make the Orb wherein $uch innumerable
multitudes of them re$ide, very many thou$ands of times big-
ger than that which $erveth the purpo$e of <I>Copernicus.</I> Be$ides,
<marg><I>A $tar is cal-

do not you call a fixed $tar very $mall, I mean even one of the
mo$t apparent, and not one of tho$e which $hun our $ight; and
do we not call them $o in re$pect of the va$t $pace circumfu$ed?
Now if the whole Starry Sphere were one entire lucid body; who
<marg><I>The whole $tar-

from a great di-
$tance might ap-
pear as $mall as
one $ingle $tar.</I></marg>
is there, that doth not know that in an infinite $pace there might be
a$$igned a di$tance $o great, as that the $aid lucid Sphere might
from thence $hew as little, yea le$$e than a fixed $tar, now ap-
peareth beheld from the Earth? From thence therefore we
$hould <I>then</I> judg that $elf $ame thing to be little, which <I>now</I> from

that one may collect, that in ca$e the Heavens, the Stars, and
the quantity of their di$tances and magnitudes which he hath
hitherto held, be let alone, (although he never certainly fancied
to him$elf any conceivable magnitude thereof) he perfectly di$-
cerns and comprehends the benefits that flow from thence to the
Earth, which is no longer an incon$iderable thing; nor are they
any longer $o remote as to appear $o very $mall, but big enough to
be able to operate on the Earth; and that the di$tance between
them and <I>Saturn</I> is very well proportioned, and that he, for all
the$e things, hath very probable rea$ons; of which I would glad-
ly have heard $ome one: but being that in the$e few words he
<marg><I>The Auihour

$elfin his interro-

confounds and contradicts him$elf, it maketh me think that he
is very poor and ill furni$hed with tho$e probable rea$ons, and
that tho$e which he calls rea$ons, are rather fallacies, or dreams
of an over-weening fancy. For I ask of him, whether the$e Ce-
<marg><I>Inter ogatories

thour of the Con-
clu$ions, by which
the weakne$$e of

le$tial bodies truly operate on the Earth, and whether for the
working of tho$e effects they were produced of $uch and $uch
magnitudes, and di$po$ed at $uch and $uch di$tances, or el$e
whether they have nothing at all to do with Terrene mattets. If
they have nothing to do with the Earth; it is a great folly for us
that are Earth-born, to offer to make our $elves arbitrators of
their magnitudes, and regulators of their local di$po$itions, $ee-
ing that we are altogether ignorant of their whole bu$ine$$e and
concerns; but if he $hall $ay that they do operate, and that they
are directed to this end, he doth affirm the $ame thing which a
little before he denied, and prai$eth that which even now he
condemned, in that he $aid, that the Cele$tial bodies $ituate $o
far remote as that they appear very $mall, cannot have any in-
fluence at all upon the Earth. But, good Sir, in the Starry Sphere
pre-e$tabli$hed at its pre$ent di$tance, and which you did ac-
knowledg to be in your judgment, well proportioned to have an
influence upon the$e Terrene bodies, many $tars appear very
$mall, and an hundred times as many more are wholly invi$ible
unto us (which is an appearing yet le$$e than very $mall)
therefore it is nece$$ary that (contradicting your $elf) you do
<foot>now</foot>
<p n=>337</p>
now deny their operation upon the the Earth; or el$e that ($till
contradicting your $elf) you grant that their appearing very $mall
doth not in the lea$t le$$en their influence; or el$e that (and this
$hall be a more $incere and mode$t conce$$ion) you acknowledg
and freely confe$$e, that our pa$$ing judgment upon their mag-
nitudes and di$tances is a vanity, not to $ay pre$umption or
ra$hne$$e.</P>
<P>SIMP. Truth is, I my $elf did al$o, in reading this pa$$age
perceive the manife$t contradiction, in $aying, that the Stars. (if
one may $o $peak) of <I>Copernicus</I> appearing $o very $mall, could
not operate on the Earth, and not perceiving that he had granted
an influence upon the Earth to tho$e of <I>Ptolomy,</I> and his $ecta-
tors, which appear not only very $mall, but are, for the mo$t
part, very invi$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. But I proceed to another con$ideration: What is the
rea$on, doth he $ay, why the $tars appear $o little? Is it haply,
becau$e they $eem $o to us? Doth not he know, that this com-
<marg><I>That remote ol-
jects appeare $o
$mall, is the defect
of the eye, as i<*>
demon$trated.</I></marg>
meth from the In$trument that we imploy in beholding them, to
wit, from our eye? And that this is true, by changing In$tru-
ment, we $hall $ee them bigger and bigger, as much as we will.
And who knows but that to the Earth, which beholdeth them
without eyes, they may not $hew very great, and $uch as in reali-
ty they are? But it's time that, omitting the$e trifles, we come
to things of more moment; and therefore I having already de-
mon$trated the$e two things: Fir$t, how far off the Firmament
ought to be placed to make, that the grand Orb cau$eth no grea-
ter difference than that which the Terre$trial Orb occa$ioneth in
the remotene$$e of the Sun; And next, how likewi$e to make
that a $tar of the Firmament appear to us of the $ame bigne$$e,
as now we $ee it, it is not nece$$ary to $uppo$e it bigger than the
Sun; I would know whether <I>Tycho,</I> or any of his adherents hath
ever attempted to find out, by any means, whether any appea-
rance be to be di$covered in the $tarry Sphere, upon which one
may the more re$olutely deny or admit the annual motion of

there any need there $hould; $eeing that it is <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf
that $aith, that no $uch diver$ity is there: and they, arguing <I>ad

demon$trate the improbability that followeth thereupon, name-
ly, that it would be nece$$ary to make the Sphere $o immen$e,
that a fixed $tar, to appear unto us as great as it now $eems, ought
of nece$$ity to be of $o immen$e a magnitude, as that it would

I do not only believe, that none of them ever applied them$elves
to make any $uch ob$ervation, but I am al$o uncertain, whether
any of them do know what alteration the Earths annual motion
ought to produce in the fixed $tars, in ca$e the $tarry Sphere were
not $o far di$tant, as that in them the $aid diver$ity, by rea$on of
its minuity di$-appeareth; for their $urcea$ing that inqui$ition,
and referring them$elves to the meer a$$ertion of <I>Copernicus,</I>
may very well $erve to convict a man, but not to acquit him of
the fact: For its po$$ible that $uch a diver$ity may be, and yet
<marg>Copernicus <I>un-
der$tood not $ome
things for want of
In$truments.</I></marg>
not have been $ought for; or that either by rea$on of its minui-
ty, or for want of exact In$truments it was not di$covered by <I>Co-
pernicus</I>; for though it were $o, this would not be the fir$t thing,
that he either for want of In$truments, or for $ome other defect
hath not known; and yet he proceeding upon other $olid and
rational conjectures, affirmeth that, which the things by him not
di$covered do $eem to contradict: for, as hath been $aid already,
without the Tele$cope, neither could <I>Mars</I> be di$cerned to in-
crea$e 60. times; nor <I>Venus</I> 40. more in that than in this po$iti-
on; yea, their differences appear much le$$e than really they are:
and yet neverthele$$e it is certainly di$covered at length, that
tho$e mutations are the $ame, to an hair that the <I>Copernican</I> Sy-
<marg>Tycho <I>and o-
thers argue a-
gain$t the annual
motion, from the
invariable eleva-
tion of the Pole.</I></marg>
$teme required. Now it would be very well, if with the greate$t
accuratene$$e po$$ible one $hould enquire whether $uch a muta-
tion as ought to be di$coverable in the fixed $tars, $uppo$ing the
annual motion of the Earth, would be ob$erved really and in
effect, a thing which I verily believe hath never as yet been done
by any; done, $aid I? no, nor haply (as I $aid before) by many
well under$tood how it ought to be done. Nor $peak I this at
randome, for I have heretofore $een a certain Manu$cript of
one of the$e <I>Anti-Copernicans,</I> which $aid, that there would ne-
ce$$arily follow, in ca$e that opinion were true, a continual ri-
$ing and falling of the Pole from $ix moneths to $ix moneths, ac-
cording as the Earth in $uch a time, by $uch a $pace as is the dia-
meter of the grand Orb, retireth one while towards the North, and
another while towards the South; and yet it $eemed to him rea$o-
nable, yea nece$$ary, that we, following the Earth, when we were
towards the North $hould have the Pole more elevated than when
we are towards the South. In this very error did one fall that was
otherwi$e a very skilful Mathematician, &amp; a follower of <I>Copernic.</I>
<marg>* Chri$iophoius
Rothmannus.</marg>
as <I>Tycho</I> relateth in his ^{*}<I>Progymna$ma. pag</I> 684. which $aid, that he
had ob$erved the Polar altitude to vary, and to differ in Summer
from what it is in Winter: and becau$e <I>Tycho</I> denieth the merit
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>339</p>
of the cau$e, but findeth no fault with the method of it; that
is, denieth that there is any mutation to be $een in the altitude of
the Pole, but doth not blame the inqui$ition, for not being adap-
ted to the finding of what is $ought, he thereby $heweth, that he
al$o e$tecemed the Polar altitude varied, or not varied every $ix
moneths, to be a good te$timony to di$prove or inferre the annual
motion of the Earth.</P>
<P>SIMP. In truth, <I>Salviatus,</I> my opinion al$o tells me, that the
$ame mu$t nece$$arily en$ue: for I do not think that you will de-
ny me, but that if we walk only 60. miles towards the North,
the Pole will ri$e unto us a degree higher, and that if we move
60. miles farther Northwards, the Pole will be elevated to us a
degree more, &amp;c. Now if the approaching or receding 60. miles
onely, make $o notable a change in the Polar altitudes, what
alteration would follow, if the Earth and we with it, $hould
be tran$ported, I will not $ay 60. miles, but 60. thou$and miles
that way.</P>
<P>SALV. It would follow (if it $hould proceed in the $ame
proportion) that the Pole $hall be elevated a thou$and degrees.
See, <I>Simplicius,</I> what a long rooted opinion can do. Yea, by
rea$on you have fixed it in your mind for $o many years, that it
is Heaven, that revolveth in twenty four hours, and not the
Earth, and that con$equently the Poles of that Revolution are in
Heaven, and not in the Terre$trial Globe, cannot now, in an
hours time $hake off this habituated conceipt, and take up the
contrary, fancying to your $elf, that the Earth is that which mo-
veth, only for $o long time as may $uffice to conceive of what
would follow, thereupon $hould that lye be a truth. If the Earth
<I>Simplicius,</I> be that which moveth in its $elf in twenty four hours,
in it are the Poles, in it is the Axis, in it is the Equinoctial, that
is, the grand Circle, de$cribed by the point, equidi$tant from the
Poles, in it are the in$inite Parallels bigger and le$$er de$cribed by
the points of the $uperficies more and le$$e di$tant from the Poles,
in it are all the$e things, and not in the $tarry Sphere, which, as
being immoveable, wants them all, and can only by the imagina-
tion be conceived to be therein, prolonging the Axis of the Earth
$o far, till that determining, it $hall mark out two points placed
right over our Poles, and the plane of the Equinoctial being ex-
tended, it $hall de$cribe in Heaven a circle like it $elf. Now if the
true Axis, the true Poles, the true Equinoctial, do not change
in the Earth $o long as you continue in the $ame place of the
Earth, and though the Earth be tran$ported, as you do plea$e,
yet you $hall not change your habitude either to the Poles, or to
the circles, or to any other Earthly thing; and this becau$e, that
that tran$po$ition being common to you and to all Terre$trial
<foot>Vv 2 things;</foot>
<p n=>340</p>
things; and that motion where it is common, is as if it never
<marg><I>Motion where

if it never were.</I></marg>
were; and as you change not habitude to the Terre$trial Poles
(habitude I $ay, whether that they ri$e, or de$cend) $o neither
$hall you change po$ition to the Poles imagined in Heaven; al-
wayes provided that by Cele$tial Poles we under$tand (as hath
been already defined) tho$e two points that come to be marked
out by the prolongation of the Terre$trial Axis unto that length.
Tis true tho$e points in Heaven do change, when the Earths tran-
$portment is made after $uch a manner, that its Axis cometh to
pa$$e by other and other points of the immoveable Cele$tial
Sphere, but our habitude thereunto changeth not, $o as that the
$econd $hould be more elevated to us than the fir$t. If any one
will have one of the points of the Firmament, which do an$wer
to the Poles of the Earth to a$cend, and the other to de$cend,
he mu$t walk along the Earth towards the one, receding from the
other, for the tran$portment of the Earth, and with it us our
$elves, (as I told you before) operates nothing at all.</P>
<P>SAGR. Permit me, I be$eech you <I>Salviatus,</I> to make this a

you have directed a Quadrant, or $ome other A$tronomical In-

there is no doubt, but that if you walk along the ^{*} Hatches to-

In$trument to the $ame Top-Gallant-Top. You $hall find its ele-
vation to be greater, and to be encrea$ed <I>v. gr.</I> 10. degrees; but
if in$tead of walking tho$e 25. or 30. paces towards the Ma$t,
you $tand $till at the Sterne, and make the whole Ship to move
thitherwards, do you believe that by rea$on of the 25. or 30.
paces that it had pa$t, the elevation of the Top-Gallant-Top
would $hew 10. degrees encrea$ed?</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe and know that it would not gain an hairs
breadth in the pa$$ing of 30. paces, nor of a thou$and, no nor of
an hundred thou$and miles; but yet I believe withal that look-
ing through the $ights at the Top and Top-Gallant, if I $hould
find a fixed Star that was in the $ame elevation, I believe I $ay,
that, holding $till the Quadrant, after I had $ailed towards the
$tar 60. miles, the eye would meet with the top of the $aid
Ma$t, as before, but not with the $tar, which would be eleva-
ted to me one degree.</P>
<P>SAGR. Then you do not think that the $ight would fall upon
that point of the Starry Sphere, that an$wereth to the direction
of the Top-Gallant Top?</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>341</p>
<P>SIMP. No: For the point would be changed, and would be
beneath the $tar fir$t ob$erved.</P>
<P>SAGR. You are in the right. Now like as that which in this
example an$wereth to the elevation of the Top-Gallant-Top, is
not the $tar, but the point of the Firmament that lyeth in a right
line with the eye, and the $aid top of the Ma$t, $o in the ca$e
exemplified, that which in the Firmament an$wers to the Pole
of the Earth, is not a $tar, or other fixed thing in the Firma-
ment; but is that point in which the Axis of the Earth continu-
ed $treight out, till it cometh thither doth determine, which point
is not fixed, but obeyeth the mutations that the Pole of the
Earth doth make. And therefore <I>Tycho,</I> or who ever el$e that
<marg><I>Upon the annu-
al motion of the

may en$ue in
$ome fixed $tar,
not in the Pole.</I></marg>
did alledg this objection, ought to have $aid that upon that
$ame motion of the Earth, were it true, one might ob$erve $ome
difference in the elevation and depre$$ion (not of the Pole, but)
of $ome fixed $tar toward that part which an$wereth to our Pole.</P>
<P>SIMP. I already very well under$tand the mi$take by them
committed; but yet therefore (which to me $eems very great) of
the argument brought on the contrary is not le$$ened, $uppo-
$ing relation to be had to the variation of the $tars, and not of
the Pole; for if the moving of the Ship but 60. miles, make a
fixed $tar ri$e to me one degree, $hall I not find alike, yea and
very much greater mutation, if the Ship $hould $ail towards the
$aid $tar for $o much $pace as is the Diameter of the Grand
Orb, which you affirm to be double the di$tance that is between
the Earth and Sun?</P>
<P>SAGR. Herein <I>Simplicius,</I> there is another fallacy, which,
<marg><I>The equivoke of
tho$e who believe
that in the annual
motion great mu-
tations are to be
made about the
elevation of a fix-
ed $tar, is confu-
ted.</I></marg>
truth is, you under$tand, but do not upon the $udden think of
the $ame, but I will try to bring it to your remembrance: Tell
me therefore; if when after you have directed the Quadrant to
a fixed $tar, and found <I>v. g.</I> its elevation to be 40. degrees,
you $hould without $tirring from the place, incline the $ide of
the Ouadrant, $o as that the $tar might remain elevated above
that direction, would you thereupon $ay that the $tar had acqui-
red greater elevation?</P>
<P>SIMP. Certainly no: For the mutation was made in the In-
$trument and not in the Ob$erver, that did change place, mo-
ving towards the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. But if you $ail or walk along the $urface of the Terre-
$trial Globe, will you $ay that there is no alteration made in the
$aid Quadrant, but that the $ame elevarion is $till retained in re-
$pect of the Heavens, $o long as you your $elf do not incline it,
but let it $tand at its fir$t con$titution?</P>
<P>SIMP. Give me leave to think of it. I would $ay without
more ado, that it would not retain the $ame, in regard the pro-
<foot>gre$$e</foot>
<p n=>342</p>
gre$$e I make is not <I>in plano,</I> but about the circumference of the
Terre$trial Globe, which at every $tep changeth inclination in
re$pect to Heaven, and con$equently maketh the $ame change
in the In$trument which is erected upon the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. You $ay very well: And you know withal, that by
how much the bigger that circle $hall be upon which you move,
$o many more miles you are to walk, to make the $aid $tar to
ri$e that $ame degree higher; and that $inally if the motion to-
wards the $tar $hould be in a right line, you ought to move yet
farther, than if it were about the circumference of never $o
great a circle?</P>
<marg><I>The right line,
and circumference
of an infinite cir-
cle, are the $ame
thing.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. True: For in $hort the circumference of an infinite
circle, and a right line are the $ame thing.</P>
<P>SAGR. But this I do not under$tand, nor as I believe, doth
<I>Simplicius</I> apprehend the $ame; and it mu$t needs be concealed
from us under $ome mi$tery, for we know that <I>Salviatus</I> never
$peaks at random, nor propo$eth any Paradox, which doth not
break forth into $ome conceit, not trivial in the lea$t. Therefore
in due time and place I will put you in mind to demon$trate this,
that the right line is the $ame with the circumference of an infi-
nite circle, but at pre$ent I am unwilling that we $hould inter-
rupt the di$cour$e in hand. Returning then to the ca$e, I pro-
po$e to the con$ideration of <I>Simplicius,</I> how the acce$$ion and
rece$$ion that the Earth makes from the $aid fixed $tar which is
neer the Pole can be made as it were by a right line, for $uch is
the Diameter of the Grand Orb, $o that the attempting to re-
gulate the elevation and depre$$ion of the Polar $tar by the mo-
tion along the $aid Diameter, as if it were by the motion about
the little circle of the Earth, is a great argument of but little
judgment.</P>
<P>SIMP. But we continue $till un$atisfied, in regard that the
$aid $mall mutation that $hould be therein, would not be di$cer-
ned; and if this be <I>null,</I> then mu$t the annual motion about
the Grand Orb a$cribed to the Earth, be <I>null</I> al$o.</P>
<P>SAGR. Here now I give <I>Salviatus</I> leave to go on, who as I
believe will not overpa$$e the elevation and depre$$ion of the
Polar $tar or any other of tho$e that are fixed as <I>null,</I> although
not di$covered by any one, and affirmed by <I>Copernicus</I> him$elf
to be, I will not $ay <I>null,</I> but unob$ervable by rea$on of its
minuity.</P>
<P>SALV. I have already $aid above, that I do not think that

any one did ever $et him$elf to ob$erve, whether in different times

there would be di$coverd $ome apparent mutation in the fixed
$tars, and not hearing $ay what tho$e apparent mutations ought to
be in particular, and in what $tars, maketh me very rea$onably
to infer that they who rely upon that general po$ition, have not
under$tood, no nor po$$ibly endeavoured to under$tand, how
the bu$ine$$e of the$e mutations goeth, nor what things tho$e
are which they $ay ought to be $een. And to this judgment I am
<marg><I>The mutations
of the fixed $tars
ought to be in $ome
greater, in others
le$$er, and in others
nothing at all.</I></marg>
the rather induced, knowing that the annual motion a$cribed
by <I>Copernicus</I> to the Earth, if it $hould appear $en$ible in the
Starry Sphere, is not to make apparent mutations equal in re-
$pect to all the $tars, but tho$e appearances ought to be made
in $ome greater, in others le$$er, and in others yet le$$er; and
la$tly, in others ab$olutely nothing at all, by rea$on of the
va$t magnitude that the circle of this annual motion is $uppo$ed
to be of. As for the mutations that $hould b $een, they are of
two kinds, one is the $aid $tars changing apparent magnitude,
and the other their variation of altitudes in the Meridian. Upon
which nece$$arily followeth the mutation of ri$ings and $ettings,
and of their di$tances from the Zenith, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>

the fixed $tars, mu$t of nece$$ity befall the Earth and be ous.
But the Sun ri$eth and declineth in our Meridian by a very great

not promi$e you the $ame at this time, and pray you to di$pen$e
with me therein till too morrow, and for the pre$ent we will go
con$idering and explaining tho$e mutations and differences that
by means of the annual motion ought to be di$cerned in the fix-
ed $tars, like as even now we $aid, for the explication whereof
certain preparatory points offer them$elves, which may facili-
tate the an$wer to the grand objection. Now rea$$uming the
two motions a$cribed to the Earth (two I $ay, for the third is
no motion, as in its place I will declare) that is the annual and
<marg><I>The annual mo-
tion made by the
centre of the Earth

diurnal, the fir$t is to be under$tood to be made by the centre of
the Earth in or about the circumference of the grand Orb, that
is of a very great circle de$cribed in the plain of the fixed and
immutable Ecliptick; the other, namely the diurnal, is made
by the Globe of the Earth in it $elf about its own centre, and
own Axis, not erect, but inclined to the Plane of the Ecliptick,
with the inclination of 23. degrees and an half, or thereabouts,
the which inclination is maintained all the year about, and that
which ought e$pecially to be ob$erved, is alwayes $ituate to-
wards the $ame point of Heaven: in $o much that the Axis of the

Earth continueth
alwayes parallel to
it $elf, and de$cri-
beth a Cylindrai-
cal $uperficies, in-
clining to the
grand Orb.</I></marg>
diurnal motion doth alwayes remain parallel to it $elf; $o that
if we imagine that $ame Axis to be continued out until it reach
the fixed $tars, whil$t the centre of the Earth is encircling the
whole Ecliptick in a year, the $aid Axis de$cribeth the $uper-
<foot>ficies</foot>
<p n=>345</p>
ficies of an oblique Cylinder, which hath for one of its ba$es
the $aid annual circle, and for the other a like circle imagina-
rily de$cribed by its extremity, or, (if you will) Pole, among$t
the fixed $tars. And this $ame cylinder is oblique to the Plane of
the Ecliptick, according to the inclination of the Axis that de-
$cribeth it, which we have $aid to be 23 degrees and an half,
the which continuing perpetually the $ame ($ave onely, that in
many thou$ands of years it maketh $ome very $mall mutation,
which nothing importeth in our pre$ent bu$ine$$e) cau$eth that
<marg><I>The Orb of the
Earth never incli-
neth, but is im-
mutably the $ame.</I></marg>
the Terre$trial Globe doth never more incline or elevate, but
$till con$erveth the $ame $tate without mutation. From whence
en$ueth, that as to what pertaineth to the mutations to be ob-
$erved in the fixed $tars dependant on the $ole annual motion,
the $ame $hall happen to any point what$oever of the Earths
$urface, as befalleth unto the centre of the Earth it $elf; and
therefore in the pre$ent explanations we will make u$e of the
centre, as if it were any what$oever point of the $uperficies.
And for a more facile under$tanding of the whole, let us de$ign
<marg><I>The fixed $tars
placed in the E-
cliptick never ele-
vate nor de$cend,
on account of the
annual motion, but
yet approach and
recede.</I></marg>
the $ame in lineal figures: And fir$t of all let us de$cribe in the
Plane of the Ecliptick the circle A N B O [<I>in Fig.</I> 7.] and let
us under$tand the points A and B, to be the extreams towards
the North and South; that is, the beginning of [<I>or entrance into</I>]
<I>Cancer</I> or <I>Capricorn,</I> and let us prolong the Diameter A B, in-
determinately by D and C towards the Starry Sphere. I $ay
now in the fir$t place, that none of the fixed $tars placed in the
Ecliptick, $hall ever vary elevation, by rea$on of any what$o-
ever mutation made by the Earth along the $aid Plane of the
Ecliptick, but $hall alwayes appear in the $ame $uperficies, al-
though the Earth $hall approach and recede as great a $pace as is
that of the diameter of the Grand Orb, as may plainly be
$een in the $aid figure. For whether the Earth be in the point
A or in B, the $tar C alwayes appeareth in the $ame line A B C;
although the di$tance B C, be le$$e than A C, by the whole
diameter A B. The mo$t therefore that can be di$covered in the
$tar C, and in any other placed in the Ecliptick, is the aug-
mented or dimini$hed apparent magnitude, by rea$on of the ap-
proximation or rece$$ion of the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. Stay a while I pray you, for I meet with a certain
$cruple, which much troubleth me, and it is this: That the $tar

So that, if the appearing under $everal lines ought to cau$e
apparent mutations, $ome difference mu$t needs appear in
this ca$e. Nay more, I will $peak it with that Philo$ophical
freedom, which ought to be allowed among$t Philo$ophick
friends, methinks that you, contradicting your $elf, deny that
now, which but even now to our admiration, you proved to be
really true, and con$iderable; I mean that which happeneth in
the Planets, and particularly in the three $uperiour ones, that
being con$tantly in the Ecliptick, or very near unto it, do not
onely $hew them$elves one while near unto us, and another
while remote, but $o deformed in their regular motions, that
they $eem $ometimes immoveable, and $ometimes many de-
grees retrograde; and all upon no other occa$ion than the an-
nual motion of the Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. Though by a thou$and accidents I have been hereto-
fore a$$ured of the wittine$$e of <I>Sagredus,</I> yet I had a de$ire by
this one experiment more to a$certain me of what I may expect
from his ingenuity, and all this for my own intere$t, for in ca$e
my Propo$itions $tand but proof again$t the hammer and fur-
nace of his judgment, I $hall be confident that they will abide
<marg>* Or will prove
of good alloy.</marg>
the ^{*} te$t of all Touch-$tones. I $ay therefore that I had pur-
po$ely di$$embled this objection, but yet not with any intent to
deceive you, and to put any fal$hood upon you, as it might
have happened if the objection by me di$gui$ed, and by you o-
ver-lookt, had been the $ame in effect as it $eemed to be in ap-
pearance, that is, really valid and conclu$ive; but it is not $o;
nay I rather $u$pect that to try me, you make as if you did not
$ee its nullity. But I will herein be too hard for you, and force
from your tongue, that which you would $o artificially conceal;
and therefore tell me, what that thing $hould be, whereby you
come to know the $tation and retrogradation of the Planets,
which is derived from the annual motion, aud which is $o great,
that at lea$t $ome foot-$teps of $uch an effect ought to appear in
the $tars of the Ecliptick?</P>
<P>SAGR. This demand of yours containeth two que$tions, to
which it is nece$$ary that I make reply; the fir$t relates to the
imputation which you lay upon me of a Di$$embler; the other
concerneth that which may appear in the $tars, <I>&amp;c.</I> As to the
fir$t, I will $ay with your permi$$ion, that it is not true, that I
have di$$embled my knowing the nullity of that objection; and
to a$$ure you of the $ame, I now tell you that I very well under-
$tand the nullity thereof.</P>
<P>SALV. But yet I do not under$tand how it can be, that you
<foot>$pake</foot>
<p n=>347</p>
$pake not friendly, when you $aid you did not know that $ame
fallacy which you now confe$$e that you know very well.</P>
<P>SAGR. The very confe$$ion of knowing it may a$$ure you
that I did not di$$emble, when I $aid that I did not under$tand it;
for if I had had a mind, and would di$$emble, who could hin-
der me from continuing in the $ame $imulation, and denying $till
that I under$tand the fallacy? I $ay therefore that I under$tood
not the $ame, at that time, but that I do now at this pre$ent ap-
prehend it, for that you have prompted my intellect, fir$t by
telling me re$olutely that it is <I>null,</I> and then by beginning to
que$tion me $o at large what thing that might be, whereby I
might come to know the $tation and retrogradation of the Pla-
<marg><I>The $tation, di-
rection and retro-
gradation of the

nets; and becau$e this is known by comparing them with the fix-
ed $tars, in relation to which, they are $een to vary their mo-
tions, one while towards the We$t, and another towards the
Ea$t, and $ometimes to abide immoveable; and becau$e there
is not any thing above the Starry Sphere, immen$ely more remote
from us, and vi$ible unto us, wherewith we may compare our
fixed $tars, therefore we cannot di$cover in the fixed $tars any
foot-$teps of what appeareth to us in the Planets. This I believe
is the $ub$tance of that which you would force from me.</P>
<P>SALV. It is $o, with the addition moreover of your admi-
<marg><I>An Indice in
the fixed $tars like
to that which is
$een in the Pla-
nets, is an argu-
ment of the Earths
annual motion.</I></marg>
rable ingenuity; and if with half a word I did open your eyes,
you by the like have remembred me that it is not altogether im-
po$$ible, but that $ometime or other $omething ob$ervable may
be found among$t the fixed $tars, by which it may be gathered
wherein the annual conver$ion re$ides, $o as that they al$o no
le$$e than the Planets and Sun it $elf, may appear in judgment to
bear witne$$e of that motion, in favour of the Earth; for I do not
think that the $tas are $pread in a $pherical $uperficies equally re-
mote from a common centre, but hold, that their di$tances from
us are $o various, that $ome of them may be twice and thrice as
remote as others; $o that if with the Tele$cope one $hould ob-
$erve a very $mall $tar neer to one of the bigger, and which
therefore was very exceeding high, it might happen that $ome
$en$ible mutation might fall out between them, corre$pondent
to that of the $uperiour Planets. And $o much $hall $erve to have
$poken at this time touching the $tars placed in the Ecliptick.
<marg><I>The fixed $tars
without the Eclip-
tick elevate and
de$cend more or
le$$e, according to
their di$tance from
the $aid Ecliptick.</I></marg>
Let us now come to the fixed $tars, placed out of the Ecliptick,
and let us $uppo$e a great circle erect upor [<I>i. e. at right angles
to</I>] the Plane of the ^{*} $ame; and let it, for example, be a cir-
cle that in the Starry Sphere an$wers to the Sol$titial Colure,
<marg>* <I>i. e.</I> of the E-
cliptick.</marg>
and let us mark it C E H [<I>in Fig.</I> 8.] which $hall happen to be
withal a Meridian, and in it we will take a $tar without the Eclip-
tick, which let be E. Now this $tar will indeed vary its elevati-
<foot>Xx 2 on</foot>
<p n=>348</p>
on upon the Earths motion; for from the Earth in A it $hall be
$een according to the ray A E, with the elevation of the angle
E A C; but from the Earth placed in B, it $hall be $een ac-
cording to the ray B E, with the elevation of the angle E B C,
bigger than the other E A C, that being extern, and this in-
tern and oppo$ite in the triangle E A B, the di$tance therefore
of the $tar E from the Ecliptick, $hall appear changed; and
likewi$e its altitude in the Meridian $hall become greater in the
po$ition B, than in the place A, according as the angle E B C
exceeds the angle E A C, which exce$$e is the quantity of the
angle A E B: For in the triangle E A B, the $ide A B being
continued to C, the exteriour angle E B C (as being equal to
the two interiour and oppo$ite E and A) exceedeth the $aid an-
gle A, by the quantity of the angle <I>E.</I> And if we $hould take
another $tar in the $ame Meridian, more remote from the Ecli-
ptick, as for in$tance the $tar H, the diver$ity in it $hall be
greater by being ob$erved from the two $tations A and B, accor-
ding as the angle A H B is greater than the other <I>E</I>; which an-
gle $hall encrea$e continually according as the ob$erved $tar $hall
be farther and farther from the Ecliptick, till that at la$t the
greate$t mutation will appear in that $tar that $hould be placed in
the very Pole of the Ecliptick. As for a full under$tanding there-
of we thus demon$trate. Suppo$e the diameter of the Grand
Orb to be A B, who$e centre [<I>in the $ame Figure</I>] is G, and
let it be $uppo$ed to be continued out as far as the Starry Sphere
in the points D and C, and from the centre G let there be erected
the Axis of the Ecliptick G F, prolonged till it arrive at the $aid
Sphere, in which a Meridian D F C is $uppo$ed to be de$cribed,
that $hall be perpendicular to the Plane of the Ecliptick; and
in the arch F C any points H and <I>E,</I> are imagined to be taken,
as places of fixed $tars: Let the lines F A, F B, A H, H G,
H B, A <I>E,</I> G <I>E,</I> B <I>E,</I> be conjoyned. And let the angle of dif-
ference, or, if you will, the Parallax of the $tar placed in the
Pole F, be A F B, and let that of the $tar placed in H, be the
angle A H <I>B,</I> and let that of the $tar in <I>E,</I> be the angle
A <I>E</I> B. I $ay, that the angle of difference of the Polar $tar F, is
the greate$t, and that of the re$t, tho$e that are nearer to the
greate$t are bigger than the more remote; that is to $ay, that the
angle F is bigger than the angle H, and this bigger than the angle
<I>E.</I> Now about the triangle F A B, let us $uppo$e a circle to be de-
$cribed. And becau$e the angle F is acute, (by rea$on that its ba$e
AB is le$$e than the diameter DC, of the $emicircle D F C) it $hall
be placed in the greater portion of the circum$cribed circle cut
by the ba$e A B. And becau$e the $aid A B is divided in the
mid$t, and at right angles by F G, the centre of the circum$cri-
<foot>bed</foot>
<p n=>349</p>
bed circle $hall be in the line F G, which let be the point I; and
becau$e that of $uch lines as are drawn from the point G, which
is not the centre, unto the circumference of the circum$cribed
circle, the bigge$t is that which pa$$eth by the centre, G F $hall
be bigger than any other that is drawn from the point G, to the
circumference of the $aid circle; and therefore that circumfe-
rence will cut the line G H (which is equal to the line G F) and
cutting G H, it will al$o cut A H. Let it cut it in L, and con-
joyn the line L B. The$e two angles, therefore, A F B and A L B
$hall be equal, as being in the $ame portion of the circle cir-
cum$cribed. But A L B external, is bigger than the internal H;
therefore the angle F is bigger than the angle H. And by the
$ame method we might demon$trate the angle H to be bigger
than the angle E, becau$e that of the circle de$cribed about the
triangle A H B, the centre is in the perpendicular G F, to which
the line G H is nearer than the line G E, and therefore the cir-
cumference of it cutteth G E, and al$o A E, whereupon the pro-
po$ition is manife$t. We will conclude from hence, that the dif-
ference of appearance, (which with the proper term of art, we
might call the Parallax of the fixed $tars) is greater, or le$$e, ac-
cording as the Stars ob$erved are more or le$$e adjacent to the
Pole of the Ecliptick, $o that, in conclu$ion of tho$e Stars that
are in the Ecliptick it $elf, the $aid diver$ity is reduced to nothing.
In the next place, as to the Earths acce$$ion by that motion to,
<marg><I>The Earth ap-
proacheth or rece-
deth from the fix-
ed $tars of the E-
cliptick, the quan-
tity of the Dinme-

or rece$$ion from the Stars, it appeareth to, and recedeth from
tho$e that are in the Ecliptick, the quantity of the whole diame-
ter of the grand Orb, as we did $ee even now, but that acce$$ion
or rece$$ion to, or from the $tars about the Pole of the Ecliptick,
is almo$t nothing; and in going to and from others, this diffe-
rence groweth greater, according as they are neerer to the Eclip-
tick. We may, in the third place, know, that the $aid difference
<marg><I>The $tars near-
er to us make
greater differences
than the more re-
more.</I></marg>
of A$pect groweth greater or le$$er, according as the Star ob$er-
ved $hall be neerer to us, or farther from us. For if we draw a-
nother Meridian, le$$e di$tant from the Earth; as for example,
this D F I [<I>in Fig.</I> 7.] a Star placed in F, and $een by the $ame
ray A F E, the Earth being in A, would, in ca$e it $hould be ob-
$erved from the Earth in B, appear according to the ray B F, and
would make the angle of difference, namely, B F A, bigger
than the former A E B, being the exteriour angle of the trian-
gle B F E.</P>
<P>SAGR. With great delight, and al$o benefit have I heard
your di$cour$e; and that I may be certain, whether I have right-

<I>of the fixed $tars
cau$ed by the an-
nual motion of the
Earth.</I></marg>
ly under$tood the $ame, I $hall give you the $umme of the Con-
clu$ions in a few words. As I take it, you have explained to us
the different appearances, that by means of the Earths annual mo-
<foot>tion,</foot>
<p n=>350</p>
tion, may be by us ob$erved in the fixed $tars to be of two
kinds: The one is, that of their apparent magnitudes varied, ac-
cording as we, tran$ported by the Earth, approach or recede
from the $ame: The other (which likewi$e dependeth on the
$ame acce$$ion and reee$$ion) their appearing unto us in the
$ame Meridian, one while more elevated, and another while le$$e.
Moreover, you tell us (and I under$tand it very well) that the
one and other of the$e mutations are not made alike in all the
$tars, but in $ome greater, and in others le$$er, and in others not
at all. The acce$$ion and rece$$ion whereby the $ame $tar ought
to appear, one while bigger, and another while le$$er, is in$en$i-
ble, and almo$t nothing in the $tars neer unto the pole of the E-
cliptick, but is greate$t in the $tars placed in the Ecliptick it $elf,
and indifferent in the intermediate: the contrary happens in the
other difference, that is, the elevation or depre$$ion of the $tars
placed in the Ecliptick is nothing at all, greate$t in tho$e neere$t
to the Pole of the $aid Ecliptick, and indifferent in the interme-
diate. Be$ides, both the$e differences are more $en$ible in the
Stars neere$t to us, in the more remote le$$e $en$ible, and in
tho$e that are very far di$tant wholly di$appear. This is, as to
what concerns my $elf; it remaineth now, as I conceive, that
$omething be $aid for the $atisfaction of <I>Simplicius,</I> who, as I
believe, will not ea$ily be made to over-pa$$e tho$e differences,
as in$en$ible that are derived from a motion of the Earth $o va$t,
and from a mutation that tran$ports the Earth into places twice
as far di$tant from us as the Sun.</P>
<P>SIMP. Truth is, to $peak freely, I am very loth to confe$$e, that
the di$tance of the fixed Stars ought to be $uch, that in them the
fore-mentioned differences $hould be wholly imperceptible.</P>
<P>SALV. Do notthrow your $elf into ab$olute de$pair, <I>Simpli-
cius,</I> for there may perhaps yet $ome qualification be found for
your difficulties. And fir$t, that the apparent magnitude of the
$tars is not $een to make any $en$ible alteration, ought not to be
judged by you a thing improbable, in regard you $ee the gue$$es
of men in this particular to be $o gro$$ely erroneous, e$pecially in
looking upon $plendid objects; and you your $elf beholding
<I>v. g.</I> a lighted Torch at the di$tance of 200 paces, if it ap-

proach nearer to you 3. or 4. yards, do you think that it will
$hew any whit encrea$ed in magnitude? I for my part $hould
not perceive it certainly, although it $hould approach 20. or
30. yards nearer; nay it hath $ometimes happened that in $eeing
$uch a light at that di$tance I know not how to re$olve whether
it came towards me, or retreated from me, when as it did in
reality approach nearer to me. But what need I $peak of this?
If the $elf $ame acce$$ion and rece$$ion (I $peak of a di$tance
<foot>twice</foot>
<p n=>351</p>
twice as great as that from the Sun to us) in the $tar of <I>Saturn</I> is
almo$t totally imperceptible, and in <I>Jupiter</I> not very ob$erva-
ble, what $hall we think of the fixed $tars, which I believe you
will not $cruple to place twice as far off as <I>Saturn</I>? In <I>Mars,</I>
which for that it is nearer to us -------</P>
<P>SIMP. Pray Sir, put your $elf to no farther trouble in this
particular, for I already conceive that what hath been $poken
touching the unaltered apparent magnitude of the fixed $tars may
very well come to pa$$e, but what $hall we $ay of the other dif-
ficulty that proceeds from not perceiving any variation in the
mutation of a$pect?</P>
<P>SALV. We will $ay that which peradventure may $atisfie
you al$o in this particular. And to make $hort, would you not
be $atisfied if there $hould be di$covered in the $tars face muta-
tions that you think ought to be di$covered, in ca$e the annual
motion belonged to the Earth?</P>
<P>SIMP. I $hould $o doubtle$$e, as to what concerns this par-
ticular.</P>
<P>SALV. I could wi$h you would $ay that in ca$e $uch a diffe-
<marg><I>If in the fixed
$tars one $hould
di$cover any an-
nual mutation, the
motion of the
Earth would be
undeniable.</I></marg>
rence were di$covered, nothing more would remain behind, that
might render the mobility of the Earth que$tionable. But al-
though yet that $hould not $en$ibly appear, yet is not its mo-
bility removed, nor its immobility nece$$arily proved, it being
po$$ible, (as <I>Copernicus</I> affirmeth) that the immen$e di$tance of
the Starry Sphere rendereth $uch very $mall <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> unob$er-
vable; the which as already hath been $aid, may po$$ibly not
have been hitherto $o much as $ought for, or if $ought for, yet
not $ought for in $uch a way as they ought, to wit, with that

which exactne$$e is very difficult to obtain, as well by rea$on of the
deficiency of A$ttonomical In$truments, $ubject to many altera-
tions, as al$o through the fault of tho$e that manage them with le$s
diligence then is requi$ite. A nece$$ary argument how little cre-
dit is to be given to tho$e ob$ervations may be deduced from the
differences which we find among$t A$tronomers in a$$igning the
places, I will not $ay, of the new Stars or Comets, but of the fixed
$tars them$elves, even to the altitudes of the very Poles, in
which, mo$t an end, they are found to differ from one another
many minutes. And to $peak the truth, who can in a Quadrant,

being in a Countrey Seat of mine near to <I>Florence,</I> did plainly
ob$erve the Suns arrival at, and departure from the Summer
Sol$tice, whil$t one Evening at the time of its going down it ap-
peared upon the top of a Rock on the Mountains of <I>Pictrapana,</I>
about 60. miles from thence, leaving di$covered of it a $mall
$treak or filament towards the North, who$e breadth was not
the hundredth part of its Diameter; and the following Evening
at the like $etting, it $hew'd $uch another part of it, but notably
more $mall, a nece$$ary argument, that it had begun to recede
from the Tropick; and the regre$$ion of the Sun from the fir$t to
the $econd ob$ervation, doth not import doubtle$$e a $econd mi-

nute in the Ea$t. The ob$ervation made afterwards with an ex-
qui$ite Tele$cope, and that multiplyeth the <I>Di$cus</I> of the Sun
more than a thou$and times, would prove ea$ie, and with all
delightful. Now with $uch an In$trument as this, I would have
ob$ervations to be made in the fixed $tars, making u$e of $ome
of tho$e wherein the mutation ought to appear more con$picu-
ous, $uch as are (as hath already been declared) the more re-
mote from the Ecliptick, among$t which the Harp a very great
$tar, and near to the Pole of the Ecliptick, would be very pro-
per in Countries far North, proceeding according to the man-
ner that I $hall $hew by and by, but in the u$e of another $tar;
and I have already fancied to my $elf a place very well adapted
for $uch an ob$ervation. The place is an open Plane, upon
which towards the North there ri$eth a very eminent Mountain,
in the apex or top whereof is built a little Chappel, $ituate Ea$t
and We$t, $o as that the ridg of its Roof may inter$ect at right
angles, the meridian of $ome building $tanding in the Plane. I
will place a beam parallel to the $aid ridg, or top of the Roof,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>353</p>
and di$tant from it a yard or thereabouts. This being placed, I
will $eek in the Plain the place from whence one of the $tars of
<I>Charls's</I> Waine, in pa$$ing by the Meridian, cometh to hide it
$elf behind the beam $o placed, or in ca$e the beam $hould not
be $o big as to hide the $tar, I will finde a $tation where one
may $ee the $aid beam to cut the $aid $tar into two equal parts;
an effect that with an ^{*} exqui$ite Tele$cope may be perfectly
di$cerned. And if in the place where the $aid accident is di$cover-
ed, there were $ome building, it will be the more commodious;
but if not, I will cau$e a Pole to be $tuck very fa$t in the
ground, with $ome $tanding mark to direct where to place the
eye anew, when ever I have a mind to repeat the ob$ervation.
The fir$t of which ob$ervations I will make about the Summer
Sol$tice, to continue afterwards from Moneth to Moneth, or
when I $hall $o plea$e, to the other Sol$tice; with which ob$er-
vation one may di$cover the elevation and depre$$ion of the $tar,
though it be very $mall. And if in that operation it $hall hap-
pen, that any mutation $hall di$cover it $elf, what and how great
benefit will it bring to A$tronomy? Seeing that thereby, be$ides
our being a$$ured of the annual motion, we may come to know
the grandure and di$tance of the $ame $tar.</P>
<P>SAGR. I very well comprehend your whole proceedings;
and the operation $eems to me $o ea$ie, and $o commodious for
the purpo$e, that it may very rationally be thought, that either
<I>Copernicus</I> him$elf, or $ome other A$tronomer had made trial
of it.</P>
<P>SALV. But I judg the quite contrary, for it is not probable,
that if any one had experimented it, he would not have men-
tioned the event, whether it fell out in favour of this, or that
opinion; be$ides that, no man that I can find, either for this,
or any other end, did ever go about to make $uch an Ob$ervati-
on; which al$o without an exact Tele$cope could but badly be
effected.</P>
<P>SIMP. I am fully $atisfied with what you $ay. But $eeing
that it is a great while to night, if you defire that I $hall pa$$e
the $ame quietly, let it not be a trouble to you to explain unto

reque$t might be deferred until too morrow. Be plea$ed to grant
us your promi$ed indulgence, and, laying a$ide all other di$cour-
$es, proceed to $hew us, that the motions which <I>Copernicus</I> a$$igns
to the Earth being taken for granted, and $uppo$ing the Sun
and fixed $tars immoveable, there may follow the $ame acci-
dents touching the elevations and depre$$ions of the Sun, touch-

<P>SALV. I neither ought, nor can deny any thing that <I>Sagredus</I>
$hall reque$t: And the delay by me de$ired was to no other end,
$ave only that I might have time once again to methodize tho$e
prefatory points, in my fancy, that $erve for a large and plain de-
claration of the manner how the forenamed accidents follow, as
well in the <I>Copernican</I> po$ition, as in the <I>Ptolomaick</I>: nay, with

much greater facility and $implicity in that than in this. Whence
one may manife$tly conceive that Hypothe$is to be as ea$ie to be
effected by nature, as difficult to be apprehended by the under-
$tanding: yet neverthele$$e, I hope by making u$e of another
<marg><I>Nece$$ary pre-
po$itions for the

tion.</I></marg>
kind of explanation, than that u$ed by <I>Copernicus,</I> to render like-
wi$e the apprehending of it $omewhat le$$e ob$cure. Which
that I may do, I will propo$e certain $uppo$itions of them$elves
known and manife$t, and they $hall be the$e that follow.</P>
<P>Fir$t, I $uppo$e that the Earth is a $pherical body, turning
round upon its own Axis and Poles, and that each point a$$igned
in its $uperficies, de$cribeth the circumference of a circle, great-
er or le$$er, according as the point a$$igned $hall be neerer or
farther from the Poles: And that of the$e circles the greate$t is
that which is de$cribed by a point equidi$tant from the $aid Poles;
and all the$e circles are parallel to each other; and <I>Parallels</I> we
will call them.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Earth being of a Spherical Figure, and of an o-
pacous $ub$tance, it is continually illuminated by the Sun, accor-
ding to the half of its $urface, the other half remaining ob$cure,
and the boundary that di$tingui$heth the illuminated part from
the dark being a grand circle, we will call that circle the <I>termi-
nator of the light.</I></P>
<P>Thirdly, If the Circle that is terminator of the light $hould
pa$$e by the Poles of the Earth, it would cut (being a grand
and principal circle) all the parallels into equal parts; but not
pa$$ing by the Poles, it would cut them all in parts unequal, ex-
cept only the circle in the middle, which, as being a grand circle
will be cut into equal parts.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Earth turning round upon its own Poles, the
quantities of dayes and nights are termined by the arches of the
Parallels, inter$ected by the circle, that is, the terminator of the
light, and the arch that is $cituate in the illuminated Hemi$phere
pre$cribeth the length of the day, and the remainer is the quan-
tity of the night.</P>
<P>The$e things being pre$uppo$ed, for the more clear under-
<marg><I>A plain Scheme
repre$enting the</I>
Copernican <I>Hypo-
the$is, and its con-
$equences.</I></marg>
$tanding of that which remaines to be $aid, we will lay it down
in a Figure. And fir$t, we will draw the circumference of a
circle, that $hall repre$ent unto us that of the grand Orb de$cri-
<foot>bed</foot>
<p n=>355</p>
bed in the plain of the Ecliptick, and this we will divide into
four equal parts with the two diameters <I>Capricorn Cancer,</I> and
<I>Libra Aries,</I> which, at the $ame time, $hall repre$ent unto us the
four Cardinal points, that is, the two Sol$tices, and the two E-
quinoctials; and in the centre of that circle we will place the
Sun O, fixed and immoveable.</P>
<fig>
<P>Let us next draw about the four points, Capricorn, Cancer,
Libra and Aries, as centres, four equal circles, which repre$ent
unto us the Earth placed in them at four $everal times of the
year. The which, with its centre, in the $pace of a year, pa$$eth
through the whole circumference, Capricorn, Aries, Cancer, Li-
bra, moving from Ea$t to We$t, that is, according to the order
of the Signes. It is already manife$t, that whil$t the Earth is in
Capricorn, the Sun will appear in Cancer, and the Earth moving
<marg><I>The Suns an-
nual motion, how
it comes to pa$$e,
according to</I> Co-
pernicus.</marg>
along the arch Capricorn Aries, the Sun will $eem to move along
the arch Cancer Libra, and in $hort, will run thorow the Zodiack
according to the order of the Signes, in the $pace of a year; and
by this fir$t a$$umption, without all que$tion, full $atisfaction is
given for the Suns apparent annual motion under the Ecliptick.
Now, coming to the other, that is, the diurnal motion of the
Earth in it $elf, it is nece$$ary to e$tabli$h its Poles and its Axis,
the which mu$t be under$tood not to be erect perpendicularly
upon the plain of the Ecliptick, that is, not to be parallel to the
Axis of the grand Orb, but declining from a right angle 23 de-
grees and an half, or thereabouts, with its North Pole towards
<foot>Yy 2 the</foot>
<p n=>356</p>
the Axis of the grand Orb, the Earths centre being in the Sol$ti-
tial point of Capricorn. Suppo$ing therefore the Terre$trial
Globe to have its centre in the point Capricorn, we will de$cribe
its Poles and Axis A B, inclined upon the diameter Capricorn
Cancer 23 degrees and an half; $o that the angle A Capricorn
Cancer cometh to be the complement of a Quadrant or Radius,
that is, 66 degrees and an half; and this inclination mu$t be un-
der$tood to be immutable, and we will $uppo$e the $uperiour
Pole A to be Boreal, or North, and the other Au$tral, or South.
Now imagining the Earth to revolve in it $elf about the Axis A B
in twenty four hours, from We$t to Ea$t, there $hall by all the
points a$$igned in its $uper$icies, be circles de$cribed parallel to
each other. We will draw, in this fir$t po$ition of the Earth,
the greate$t C D, and tho$e two di$tant from it <I>gr.</I> 23. and an
half, E F above, and G M beneath, and the other two extream
ones I K and L M remote, by tho$e intervals from the Poles A
and B; and as we have marked the$e five, $o we may imagine in-
numerable others, parallel to the$e, de$cribed by the innumera-
ble points of the Terre$trial $urface. Next let us $uppo$e the
Earth, with the annual motion of its centre, to transferre it $elf
into the other places already marked; but to pa$$e thither in $uch
a manner, that its own Axis A B $hall not only not change incli-
nation upon the plain of the Ecliptick, but $hall al$o never vary
direction; $o that alwayes keeping parallel to it $elf, it may
continually tend towards the $ame part of the Univer$e, or, if
you will, of the Firmament, whereas, if we do but $uppo$e it
prolonged, it will, with its extream termes, de$igne a Circle pa-
rallel and equal to the grand Orb, Libra Capricorn Aries Cancer,
as the $uperiour ba$e of a Cylinder de$cribed by it $elf in the an-
nual motion above the inferiour ba$e, Libra Capricorn Aries
Cancer. And therefore this immutability of inclination conti-
nuing, we will de$ign the$e other three figures about the centres
Aries, Cancer, and Libra, alike in every thing to that fir$t de-
$cribed about the centre Capricorn. Now we will con$ider the
fir$t figure of the Earth, in which, in regard the Axis A B is de-
clined from perpendicularity upon the diameter Capricorn Can-
cer 23 degrees and an half towards the Sun O, and the arch A I
being al$o 23 degrees and an half, the illumination of the Sun
will illu$trate the Hemi$phere of the Terre$trial Globe expo$ed
towards the Sun (of which, in this place, half is to be $een) di-
vided from the ob$cure part by the Terminator of the light
I M, by which the parallel C D, as being a grand circle, $hall
come to be divided into equal parts, but all the re$t into parts un-
equal; being that the terminator of the light I M pa$$eth not
by their Poles A B, and the parallel I K, together with all the re$t
<foot>de$cribed</foot>
<p n=>357</p>
de$cribed within the $ame, and neerer to the pole A, $hall wholly
be included in the illuminated part; as on the contrary, the op-
po$ite ones towards the Pole B, contained within the paral-
lel L M, $hall remain in the dark. Moreover, the arch A I be-
ing equal to the arch F D, and the arch A F, common to them
both, the two arches I K F and A F D $hall be equal, and each
a quadrant or 90 degrees. And becau$e the whole arch I F M
is a $emicircle, the arch F M $hall be a quadrant, and equal to
the other F K I; and therefore the Sun O $hall be in this $tate
of the Earth vertical to one that $tands in the point F. But by
the revolution diurnal about the $tanding Axis A B, all the points
of the parallel E F pa$$e by the $ame point F: and therefore in
that $ame day the Sun, at noon, $hall be vertical to all the inha-
bitants of the Parallel E F, and will $eem to them to de$cribe in its
apparent motion the circle which we call the Tropick of Cancer.
But to the inhabitants of all the Parallels that are above the pa-
rallel E F, towards the North pole A, the Sun declineth from
their <I>Vertex</I> or Zenith towards the South; and on the contrary,
to all the inhabitants of the Parallels that are beneath E F, to-
wards the Equinoctial C D, and the South Pole B, the Meridian
Sun is elevated beyond their <I>Vertex</I> towards the North Pole A.
Next, it is vi$ible that of all the Parallels, only the greate$t C D
is cut in equal parts by the Terminator of the light I M. But
the re$t, that are beneath and above the $aid grand circle, are all
inter$ected in parts unequal: and of the $uperiour ones, the $e-
midiurnal arches, namely tho$e of the part of the Terre$trial $ur-
face, illu$trated by the Sun, are bigger than the $eminocturnal
ones that remain in the dark: and the contrary befalls in the
remainder, that are under the great one C D, towards the pole B,
of which the $emidiurnal arches are le$$er than the $eminocturnal,
It is likewi$e apparently manife$t, that the differences of the $aid
arches go augmenting, according as the Parallels are neerer to
the Poles, till $uch time as the parallel I K comes to be wholly in
the part illuminated, and the inhabitants thereof have a day of
twenty four hours long, without any night; and on the contrary,
the Parallel L M, remaining all in ob$curity, hath a night of
twenty four hours, without any day. Come we next to the
third Figure of the Earth, placed with its centre in the point
Cancer, where the Sun $eemeth to be in the fir$t point of Ca-
pricorn. We have already $een very manife$tly, that by rea$on
the Axis A B doth not change inclination, but continueth paral-
lel to it $elf, the a$pect and $ituation of the Earth is the $ame to
an hair with that in the fir$t Figure; $ave onely that that Hemi-
$phere which in the fir$t was illuminated by the Sun, in this re-
maineth obtenebrated, and that cometh to be luminous, which in
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>358</p>
the fir$t was tenebrous: whereupon that which happened before
concerning the differences of dayes and nights, touching the
dayes being greater or le$$er than the nights, now falls out quite
contrary. And fir$t, we $ee, that whereas in the fir$t Figure the
circle I K was wholly in the light, it is now wholly in the dark;
and the oppo$ite arch L M is now wholly in the light, which
was before wholly in the dark. Of the parallels between the
grand circle C D, and the Pole A, the $emidiurnal arches are now
le$$er than the $eminocturnal, which before were the contrary.
Of the others likewi$e towards the Pole B, the $emidiurnal arch-
es are now bigger than the $eminocturnal, the contrary to what
happened in the other po$ition of the Earth. We now $ee the
Sun made vertical to the inhabitants of the Tropick G N, and to
be depre$$ed towards the South, with tho$e of the Parallel E F,
by all the arch E C G, that is, 47 degrees; and in $umme, to have
pa$$ed from one to the other Tropick, traver$ing the Equinoctial,
elevating and declining in the Meridians the $aid $pace of 47 de-
grees. And all this mutation is derived not from the inclination
or elevation of the Earth, but on the contrary, from its not in-
clining or elevating at all; and in a word, by continuing always
in the $ame po$ition, in re$pect of the Univer$e, onely with turn-
ing about the Sun $ituate iu the mid$t of the $aid plane, in which
it moveth it $elf about circularly with its annual motion. And
<marg><I>An admirable
accident depending
on the not inclining
of the Earths axis</I></marg>
here is to be noted an admirable accident, which is, that like as
the Axis of the Earth con$erving the $ame direction towards the
Univer$e, or we may $ay, towards the highe$t Sphere of the fixed
$tars, cau$eth the Sun to appear to elevate and incline $o great a
$pace, namely, for 47 degrees, and the fixed Stars to incline or e-
levate nothing at all; $o, on the contrary, if the $ame Axis of
the Earth $hould maintain it $elf continually in the $ame inclina-
tion towards the Sun, or, if you will, towards the Axis of the
Zodiack, no mutation would appear to be made in the Sun about
its elevating or declining, whereupon the inhabitants of one and
the $ame place would alwayes have one and the $ame difference
of dayes and nights, and one and the $ame con$titution of Sea-
$ons, that is, $ome alwayes Winter, others alwayes Summer,
others Spring, &amp;c. but, on the contrary, the alterations in the
fixed Stars would appear very great, as touching their elevation,
and inclination to us, which would amount to the $ame 47 de-
grees. For the under$tanding of which let us return to con$ider
the po$ition of the Earth, in its fir$t Figure, where we $ee the
Axis A B, with the $uperiour Pole A, to incline towards the Sun;
but in its third Figure, the $ame Axis having kept the $ame dire-
ction towards the highe$t Sphere, by keeping parallel to it $elf,
inclines no longer towards the Sun with its $uperiour Pole A, but
<foot>on</foot>
<p n=>359</p>
on the contrary reclines from its former po$ition <I>gr.</I> 47. and in-
clineth towards the oppo$ite part, $o that to re$tore the $ame in-
clination of the $aid Pole A towards the Sun, it would be requi-
$ite by turning round the Terre$trial Globe, according to the
circumference A C B D, to tran$port it towards E tho$e $ame
<I>gr.</I> 47. and for $o many degrees, any what$oever fixed $tar ob-
$erved in the Meridian, would appear to be elevated, or inclined.
Let us come now to the explanation of that which remains, and
let us con$ider the Earth placed in the fourth Figure, that is,
with its centre in the fir$t point of Libra; upon which the Sun
will appear in the beginning of Aries. And becau$e the Axis of
<fig>
the Earth, which in the fir$t Figure is $uppo$ed to be inclined up-
on the diameter Capricorn Cancer, and therefore to be in that
$ame plane, which cutting the plane of the grand Orb, accor-
ding to the line Capricorn Cancer, was erected perpendicularly
upon the $ame, tran$po$ed into the fourth Figure, and maintai-
ned, as hath alwayes been $aid, parallel to it $elf, it $hall come
to be in a plane in like manner erected to the $uperficies of
the Grand Orbe, and parallel to the plane, which at right
angles cuts the $ame $uperficies, according to the diameter Ca-
pricorn Cancer. And therefore the line which goeth from
the centre of the Sunne to the centre of the Earth, that is,
O Libra, $hall be perpendicular to the Axis BA: but the
$ame line which goeth from the centre of the Sunne to the
centre of the Earth, is al$o alwayes perpendicular to the
<foot>circle</foot>
<p n=>360</p>
circle that is the Terminator of the light; therefore this $ame
circle $hall pa$$e by the Poles A B in the fourth figure, and
in its plain the Axis A B $hall fall, but the greate$t circle pa$$ing
by the Poles of the Parallels, divideth them all in equal parts;
therefore the arches I K, E F, C D, G N, L M, $hall be all
$emicircles, and the illumin'd Hemi$phere $hall be this which
looketh towards us, and the Sun, and the Terminator of the
light $hall be one and the $ame circle A C B D, and the Earth
being in this place $hall make it Equinoctial to all its Inhabitants.
And the $ame happeneth in the $econd figure, where the Earth
having its illuminated Hemi$phere towards the Sun, $heweth us
the other that is ob$cure, with its nocturnal arches, which in
like manner are all $emicircles, and con$equently, here al$o it
maketh the Equinoctial. And la$tly in regard that the line pro-
duced from the centre of the Sun to the centre of the Earth, is
perpendicular to the Axis A B, to which the greate$t circle of
the parallels C D, is likewi$e erect, the $aid line O <I>Libra</I> $hall
pa$$e of nece$$ity by the $ame Plain of the parallel C D, cutting
its circumference in the mid$t of the diurnal arch C D; and
therefore the Snn $hall be vertical to any one that $hall $tand
where that inter$ection is made; but all the Inhabitants of that
Parallel $hall pa$$e the $ame, as being carried about by the
Earths diurnal conver$ion; therefore all the$ upon that day
$hall have the Meridian Sun in their vertex. And the Sun at the
$ame time to all the Inhabitants of the Earth $hall $eem to de-
$cribe the Grand Parallel called the Equinoctial. Furthermore,
fora$much as the Earth being in both the Sol$titial points of the
Polar circles I K and L M, the one is wholly in the light, and
the other wholly in the dark; but when the Earth is in the Equi-
noctial points, the halves of tho$e $ame polar circles are in the
light, the remainder of them being in the dark; it $hould not
be hard to under$tand, how that the Earth <I>v. gr.</I> from <I>Cancer</I>
(where the parallel I K is wholly in the dark) to <I>Leo,</I> one part of
the parallel towards the point I, beginneth to enter into the light,
and that the Terminator of the light I M beginneth to retreat to-
wards the Pole AB, inter$ecting the circle ACBD nolonger in IM,
but in two other points falling between the terms I A and MB, of
the arches IA and M B; whereupon the Inhabitants of the circle
begin to enjoy the light, and the other Inhabitants of the circle
L M to partake of night. And thus you $ee that by two $imple
motions made in times proportionate to their bigne$$es, and not
contrary to one another, but performed, as all others that be-
long to moveable mundane bodies, from We$t to Ea$t a$$igned
to the Terre$trial Globe, adequate rea$ons are rendred of all
tho$e <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> or appearances, for the accommodating of
<foot>which</foot>
<p n=>361</p>
which to the $tability of the Earth it is nece$$ary (for$aking that
Symetry which is ob$erved to be between the velocities and mag-
nitudes of moveables) to a$cribe to a Sphere, va$t above all
others, an unconceiveable celerity, whil$t the other le$$er
Spheres move extream $lowly; and which is more, to make that
motion contrary to all their motions; and, yet again to adde to
the improbability, to make that $uperiour Sphere forcibly to
tran$port all the inferionr ones along with it contrary to their
proper inclination. And here I refer it to your judgment to de-
termine which of the two is the mo$t probable.</P>
<P>SAGR. To me, as far as concerneth $en$e, there appeareth
no $mall difference betwixt the $implicity and facility of opera-
ting effects by the means a$$igned in this new con$titution, and
the multiplicity, con$ufion, and difficulty, that is found in the
ancient and commonly received Hypothe$is. For if the Univer$e
were di$po$ed according to this multiplicity, it would be ne-
ce$$ary to renounce many Maximes in Philo$ophy commonly re-
<marg><I>Axiomes com-
monly admitted by
all Philo$ophers.</I></marg>
ceived by Philo$ophers, as for in$tance, That Nature doth
not multiply things without nece$$ity; and, That She makes u$e
of the mo$t facile and $imple means in producing her effects;
and, That She doth nothing in vain, and the like. I do confe$$e
that I never heard any thing more admirable than this, nor can I
believe that Humane Under$tanding ever penetrated a more
$ublime $peculation. I know not what <I>Simplicius</I> may think
of it.</P>
<P>SIMP. The$e (if I may $peak my judgment freely) do $eem
<marg>Ari$totle <I>tax-
eth</I> Plato <I>for being
too $tudious of Ge-
ometry.</I></marg>
to me $ome of tho$e Geometrical $ubtilties which <I>Ari$totle</I> finds
fault with in <I>Plato,</I> when he accu$eth him that by his too
much $tudying of Geometry he for$ook $olid Philo$ophy; and I
have known and heard very great <I>Peripatetick</I> Philo$ophers to
di$$wade their Scholars from the Study of the Mathematicks, as
tho$e that render the wit cavilous, and unable to philo$ophate
well; an In$titute diametrically contrary to that of <I>Plato,</I> who
admitted uone to Philo$ophy, unle$$e he was fir$t well entered in
Geometry.</P>
<P>SALV. I commend the policy of the$e your <I>Peripateticks,</I> in
<marg>Peripatetick <I>Phi-
lo$ophers condemn
the Study of Geo-
metry, and why.</I></marg>
dehorting their Di$ciples from the Study of Geometry, for that
there is no art more commodious for detecting their fallacies; but
$ee how they differ from the Mathematical Philo$ophers, who
much more willingly conver$e with tho$e that are well ver$t in
the commune Peripatetick Philo$ophy, than with tho$e that are
de$titute of that knowledg, who for want thereof cannot di-
$tingui$h between doctrine and doctrine. But pa$$ing by this, tell
me I be$eech you, what are tho$e extravagancies and tho$e too
affected $ubtilties that make you think this <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teme
the le$$e plau$ible?</P>
<foot>Zz SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>362</p>
<P>SIMP. To tell you true, I do not very well know; perhaps,
becau$e I have not $o much as learnt the rea$ons that are by <I>Ftolo-
my</I> produced, of tho$e effects, I mean of tho$e $tations, retrogra-
dations, acce$$ions, rece$$ions of the Planets; lengthenings and
$hortnings of dayes, changes of $ea$ons, &amp;c. But omitting the
con$equences that depend on the fir$t $uppo$itions, I find in the
$uppo$itions them$elves no $mall difficulties; which $uppo$itions,
if once they be overthrown, they draw along with them the ruine
of the whole fabrick. Now fora$much as becau$e the whole
module of <I>Copernicus</I> $eemeth in my opinion to be built upon in-
firm foundations, in that it relyeth upon the mobility of the earth,
if this $hould happen to be di$proved, there would be no need of
farther di$pute. And to di$prove this, the Axiom of <I>Ari$totle</I>
is in my judgment mo$t $ufficient, That of one $imple body,
one $ole $imple motion can be natural: but here in this ca$e, to
<marg><I>Four $everal
motions a$$igned to
the Earth.</I></marg>
the Earth, a $imple body, there are a$$igned 3. if not 4. motions,
and all very different from each other. For be$ides the light
motion, as a grave body towards its centre, which cannot be de-
nied it, there is a$$igned to it a circular motion in a great circle
about the Sun in a year, and a vertiginous conver$ion about its
own centre in twenty four hours. And that in the next place
which is more exorbitant, &amp; which happly for that rea$on you pa$s
over in $ilence, there is a$cribed to it another revolution about
its own centre, contrary to the former of twenty four hours,
and which fini$heth its period in a year. In this my under$tand-
ing apprehendeth a very great contradiction.</P>
<marg><I>The motion of
de$cent belongs not
to the terre$trial
Globe, but to its
parts.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. As to the motion of de$cent, it hath already been con-
cluded not to belong to the Terre$trial Globe which did never
move with any $uch motion, nor never $hall do; but is (if there be
$uch a thing) that propen$ion of its parts to reunite them$elves
to their whole. As, in the next place, to the Annual motion,
<marg><I>The annual and
diurnal motion are
compatible in the
Earth.</I></marg>
and the Diurnal, the$e being both made towards one way, are
very compatible, in the $ame manner ju$t as if we $hould let a
Ball trundle downwards upon a declining $uperficies, it would in
its de$cent along the $ame $pontaneou$ly revolve in it $elf. As
to the third motion a$$igned it by <I>Copernicus,</I> namely about it
$elf in a year, onely to keep its Axis inclined and directed
towards the $ame part of the Firmament, I will tell you a thing
worthy of great con$ideration: namely <I>ut tantum abe$t</I> (although
it be made contrary to the other annual) it is $o far from having
any repugnance or difficulty in it, that naturally and without any
<marg><I>Every pen$il and
librated, body car-
ryed round in the
circumference of a
circle, acquireth of
it $elf a motion in
it $elf contrary to
that.</I></marg>
moving cau$e, it agreeth to any what$oever $u$pended and libra-
ted body, which if it $hall be carried round in the circumference
of a circle, immediate of it $elf, it acquireth a conver$ion about
its own centre, contrary to that which carrieth it about, and of
<foot>$uch</foot>
<p n=>363</p>
$uch velocity, that they both fini$h one revolution in the $ame
time preci$ely. You may $ee this admirable, and to our pur-
<marg><I>An Experiment
which $en$ibly
$hews that two con-
trary motions may
naturally agree i<*>
the $ame move-
able.</I></marg>
po$e accommodate experience, if putting in a Ba$on of water a
Ball that will $wim; and holding the Ba$on in your hand, you
turn round upon your toe, for you $hall immediatly $ee the Ball
begin to revolve in it $elf with a motion, contrary to that of the
Ba$on, and it $hall fini$h its revolution, when that of the Ba$on it
$hall fini$h. Now what other is the Earth than a pen$il Globe
librated in tenuous and yielding aire, which being carried a-
bout in a year along the circumference of a great circle, mu$t
<marg><I>The third motion
a$cribed to the
Earth is rather
re$ting immove-
able.</I></marg>
needs acquire, without any other mover, a revolution about its
own centre, annual, and yet contrary to the other motion in like
manner annual? You $hall $ee this effect I $ay, but if afterwards
you more narrowly con$ider it, you $hall find this to be no real
thing, but a meer appearance; and that which you think to be
a revolution in it $elf, you will find to be a not moving at all,
but a continuing altogether immoveable in re$pect of all that
which without you, and without the ve$$el is immoveable: for if in
that Ball you $hall make $ome mark, and con$ider to what part of
the Room where you are, or of the Field, or of Heaven it is
$ituate, you $hall $ee that mark in yours, and the ve$$els revolu-
tion to look alwayes towards that $ame part; but comparing it to
the ve$$el and to your $elf that are moveable, it will appear to go
altering its direction, and with a motion contrary to yours, and
that of the ve$$el, to go $eeking all the points of its circumgyra-
tion; $o that with more rea$on you and the ba$on may be $aid
to turn round the immoveable Ball, than that it moveth round
in the ba$on. In the $ame manner the Earth $u$pended and li-
brated in the circumference of the Grand Orbe, and $cituate in
$uch $ort that one of its notes, as for example, its North Pole, loo-
keth towards $uch a Star or other part of the Firmament, it always
keepeth directed towards the $ame, although carried round by
the annual motion about the circumference of the $aid Grand
Orbe. This alone is $ufficient to make the Wonder cea$e, and
to remove all difficulties. But what will <I>Simplicius</I> $ay, if to
this non-indigence of the co-operating cau$e we $hould adde
an admirable intrin$ick vertue of the Terre$trial Globe, of look-

<P>SALV. I am for certain, and think that all tho$e that have

company therein; nor $hould I de$pair, that what hath befallen
me in this ca$e, might po$$ibly happen to you al$o, if $o be a cu-

before $poken of. But (permit me to u$e this phra$e) the pu$illa-
nimity of vulgar Wits is come to that pa$$e, that not only like
blind men, they make a gift, nay tribute of their own a$$ent to
what$oever they find written by tho$e Authours, which in the
infancy of their Studies were laid before them, as authentick by
their Tutors, but refu$e to hear (not to $ay examine) any new
Propo$ition or Probleme, although it not only never hath been
confuted, but not $o much as examined or con$idered by their
Authours. Among$t which, one is this, of inve$tigating what is
the true, proper, primary, interne, and general matter and $ub-
$tance of this our Terre$trial Globe; For although it never came
into the mind either of <I>Ari$totle,</I> or of any one el$e, before <I>Wil-
liam Gilbert</I> to think that it might be a Magnet, $o far are <I>Ari-
$totle</I> and the re$t from confuting this opinion, yet neverthele$$e
I have met with many, that at the very fir$t mention of it, as a
Hor$e at his own $hadow, have $tart back, and refu$ed to di$-
cour$e thereof, and cen$ured the conceipt for a vain <I>Chym&aelig;ra,</I>
yea, for a $olemn madne$$e: and its po$$ible the Book of <I>Gilbert</I>
had never come to my hands, if a Peripatetick Philo$opher, of great
fame, as I believe, to free his Library from its contagion, had not
given it me.</P>
<P>SIMP. I, who ingenuou$ly confe$$e my $elf to be one of
tho$e vulgar Wits, and never till within the$e few dayes that I
have been admitted to a $hare in your conferences, could I pre-
tend to have in the lea$t withdrawn from tho$e trite and popu-
lar paths, yet, for all that, I think I have advantaged my $elf $o
much, as that I could without much trouble or difficulty, ma$ter
the roughne$$es of the$e novel and fanta$tical opinions.</P>
<P>SALV. If that which <I>Gilbert</I> writeth be true, then is it no o-
pinion, but the $ubject of Science; nor is it new, but as antient
as the Earth it $elf; nor can it (being true) be rugged or diffi-
cult, but plain and ea$ie; and when you plea$e I $hall make you

dreadfull, like as a little child doth fear the Hobgoblin, without

<P>SIMP. I $hould be glad to be informed, and reclaimed from
an errour.</P>
<P>SALV. An$wer me then to t<*> que$tions that I $hall ask you.
And fir$t of all, Tell me whether you believe, that this our Globe,
which we inhabit and call Earth, con$i$teth of one $ole and $im-
ple matter, or el$e that it is an aggregate of matters different
from each other.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $ee it to be compo$ed of $ub$tances and bodies very
<marg><I>The</I> Terre$trial
Globe <I>compo$ed of
$undry matters.</I></marg>
different; and fir$t, for the greate$t parts of the compo$ition,
I $ee the Water and the Earth, which extreamly differ from one
another.</P>
<P>SAIV. Let us, for this once, lay a$ide the Seas and other Wa-
ters, and let us con$ider the $olid parts, and tell me, if you think
them one and the $ame thing, or el$e different.</P>
<P>SIMP. As to appearance, I $ee that they are different things,
there being very great heaps of unfruitful $ands, and others of
fruitful $oiles; There are infinite $harp and $teril mountains, full
of hard $tones and quarries of $everal kinds, as Porphyre, Ala-
bla$ter, Ja$per, and a thou$and other kinds of Marbles: There
are va$t Minerals of $o many kinds of metals; and in a word,
$uch varieties of matters, that a whole day would not $uffice on-
ly to enumerate them.</P>
<P>SALV. Now of all the$e different matters, do you think,
that in the compo$ition of this grand ma$$e, there do concur por-
tions, or el$e that among$t them all there is one part that far ex-
ceeds the re$t, and is as it were the matter and $ub$tance of the
immen$e lump?</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that the Stones, Marbles, Metals, Gems, and
the $o many other $everal matters are as it were Jewels, and ex-
teriour and $uperficial Ornaments of the primary Globe, which
in gro$$e, as I believe, doth without compare exceed all the$e
things put together.</P>
<P>SALV. And this principal and va$t ma$$e, of which tho$e
things above named are as it were excre$$ences and ornaments, of
what matter do you think that it is compo$ed?</P>
<P>SIMP. I think that it is the $imple, or le$$e impure element of
Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. But what do you under$tand by Earth? Is it haply
that which is di$per$ed all over the fields, which is broke up with
Mattocks and Ploughs, wherein we $owe corne, and plant fruits,
and in which great bo$cages grow up, without the help of cul-
<foot>ture</foot>
<p n=>366</p>
ture, and which is, in a word, the habitation of all animals, and
the womb of all vegetables?</P>
<P>SIMP. Tis this that I would affirm to be the $ub$tance of this
our Globe.</P>
<P>SALV. But in this you do, in my judgment, affirm that which
is not right: for this Earth which is broke up, is $owed, and is
fertile, is but one part, and that very $mall of the $urface of the
Globe, which doth not go very deep, yea, its depth is very $mall,
in compari$on of the di$tance to the centre: and experience
$heweth us, that one $hall not dig very low, but one $hall finde
matters very different from this exteriour $curf, more $olid, and
not good for the production of vegetables. Be$ides the interne
parts, as being compre$$ed by very huge weights that lie upon
them, are, in all probability, $lived, and made as hard as any
hard rock. One may adde to this, that fecundity would be in
vain conferred upon tho$e matters which never were de$igned to
bear fruit, but to re$t eternally buried in the profound and dark
aby$$es of the Earth.</P>
<P>SIMP. But who $hall a$$ure us, that the parts more inward
and near to the centre are unfruitful? They al$o may, perhaps,
have their productions of things unknown to us?</P>
<P>SALV. You may a$well be a$$ured thereof, as any man el$e,
as being very capable to comprehend, that if the integral bodies
of the Univer$e be produced onely for the benefit of Mankind,
this above all the re$t ought to be de$tin d to the $ole convenien-
ces of us its inhabitants. But what bene$it can we draw from
matters $o hid and remote from us, as that we $hall never be a-
<marg><I>The interne parts
of the terre$trial
Globe mu$t of ne-
ce$$ity be $olid.</I></marg>
ble to make u$e of them? Therefore the interne $ub$tance of
this our Globe cannot be a matter frangible, di$$ipable, and non-
coherent, like this $uperficial part which we call ^{*} EARTH: but
<marg>* Or MOULD.</marg>
it mu$t, of nece$$ity, be a mo$t den$e and $olid body, and in a
word, a mo$t hard $tone. And, if it ought to be $o, what rea$on
is there that $hould make you more $crupulous to believe that it
is a Load$tone than a Porphiry, a Ja$per, or other hard Mar-
ble? Happily if <I>Gilbert</I> had written, that this Globe is all com-
<marg>Of which with
the Latin tran$la-
tour, I mu$t once
more profe$$e my
$elf ignorant.</marg>
pounded within of ^{*} <I>Pietra Serena,</I> or of <I>Chalcedon,</I> the paradox
would have $eemed to you le$$e exorbitant?</P>
<P>SIMP. That the parts of this Globe more intern are more
compre$$ed, and $o more $lived together and $olid, and more
and more $o, according as they lie lower, I do grant, and $o
likewi$e doth <I>Ari$totle,</I> but that they degenerate and become
other than Earth, of the $ame $ort with this of the $uperficial
parts, I $ee nothing that obliege h me to believe.</P>
<P>SALV. I undertook not this di$cour$e with an intent to prove
demon$tratively that the primary and real $ub$tance of this our
<foot>Globe</foot>
<p n=>367</p>
Globe is Load-$tone; but onely to $hew that no rea$on could be
given why one $hould be more unwilling to grant that it is of
Load-$tone, than of $ome other matter. And if you will but
<marg><I>Our Globe would
have been called
$tone, in $tead of
Earth, if that
name had been gi-
uen it in the be-
ginning.</I></marg>
$eriou$ly con$ider, you $hall find that it is not improbable, that
one $ole, pure, and arbitrary name, hath moved men to think
that it con$i$ts of Earth; and that is their having made u$e com-
monly from the beginning of this word Earth, as well to $igni-
$ie that matter which is plowed and $owed, as to name this our
Globe. The denomination of which if it had been taken from
$tone, as that it might as well have been taken from that as
from the Earth; the $aying that its primary $ub$tance was $tone,
would doubtle$$e have found no $cruple or oppo$ition in any
man. And is $o much the more probable, in that I verily be-
lieve, that if one could but pare off the $curf of this great Globe,
taking away but one full thou$and or two thou$and yards; and
afterwards $eperate the Stones from the Earth, the accumulati-
on of the $tones would be very much biger than that of the fer-
tile Mould. But as for the rea$ons which concludently prove <I>de
facto,</I> that is our Globe is a Magnet, I have mentioned none of
them, nor is this a time to alledg them, and the rather, for that
to your benefit you may read them in <I>Gilbert</I>; onely to encou-
rage you to the peru$al of them, I will $et before you, in a $imi-
<marg><I>The method of</I>

litude of my own, the method that he ob$erved in his Philo$o-
phy. I know you under$tand very well how much the know-
ledg of the accidents is $ub$ervient to the inve$tigation of the
$ub$tance and e$$ence of things; therefore I de$ire that you
would take pains to informe your $elf well of many accidents and
properties that are found in the Magnet, and in no other $tone,
<marg><I>Many proper-
ties in the Mag-
net.</I></marg>
or body; as for in$tance of attracting Iron, of conferring up-
on it by its $ole pre$ence the $ame virtue, of communicating
likewi$e to it the property of looking towards the Poles, as it
al$o doth it $elf; and moreover endeavour to know by trial,
that it containeth in it a virtue of conferring upon the magnetick
needle not onely the direction under a Meridian towards the
Poles, with an Horizontal motion, (a property a long time ago
known) but a new found accident, of declining (being ballanced
under the Meridian before marked upon a little $pherical Mag-
net) of declining I $ay to determinate marks more or le$$e, ac-
cording as that needle is held nearer or farther from the Pole,
till that upon the Pole it $elf it erecteth perpendicularly, where-
as in the middle parts it is parallel to the Axis. Furthermore pro-
cure a proof to be made, whether the virtue of attracting Iron,
re$iding much more vigorou$ly about the Poles, than about the
middle parts, this force be not notably more vigorous in one
Pole than in the other, and that in all pieces of Magnet; the
<foot>$tronger</foot>
<p n=>368</p>
$tronger of which Poles is that which looketh towards the South.
Ob$erve, in the next place, that in a little Magnet this South and
more vigorous Pole, becometh weaker, when ever it is to take
up an iron in pre$ence of the North Pole, of another much big-
ger Magnet: and not to make any tedious di$cour$e of it, a$$er-
tain your $elf, by experience, of the$e and many other properties
de$cribed by <I>Gilbert,</I> which are all $o peculiar to the Magnet, as
<marg><I>An Argument
proving the terre-
$trial Globe to be
a</I> Magnet.</marg>
that none of them agree with any other matter. Tell me now,
<I>Simplicius,</I> if there were laid before you a thou$and pieces of
$everal matters, but all covered and concealed in a cloth, under
which it is hid, and you were required, without uncovering them,
to make a gue$$e, by external $ignes, at the matter of each of
them, and that in making trial, you $hould hit upon one that
$hould openly $hew it $elf to have all the properties by you alrea-
dy acknowledged to re$ide onely in the Magnet, and in no other
matter, what judgment would you make of the e$$ence of $uch a
body? Would you $ay, that it might be a piece of Ebony, or
Alabla$ter, or Tin.</P>
<P>SIMP. I would $ay, without the lea$t h&aelig;$itation, that it was a
piece of Load-$tone.</P>
<P>SAL<*>. If it be $o, $ay re$olutely, that under this cover and
$curf of Earth, $tones, metals, water, &amp;c. there is hid a great
Magnet, fora$much as about the $ame there may be $een by any
one that will heedfully ob$erve the $ame, all tho$e very accidents
that agree with a true and vi$ible Globe of Magnet; but if no
more were to be $een than that of the Declinatory Needle, which
being carried about the Earth, more and more inclineth, as it ap-
proacheth to the North Pole, and declineth le$$e towards the E-
quinoctial, under which it finally is brought to an <I>&AElig;quilibrium,</I>
it might $erve to per$wade even the mo$t $crupulous judgment. I
forbear to mention that other admirable effect, which is $en$ibly
ob$erved in every piece of Magnet, of which, to us inhabitants
of the Northern Hemi$phere, the Meridional Pole of the $aid Mag-
net is more vigorous than the other; and the difference is found
greater, by how much one recedeth from the Equinoctial; and
under the Equinoctial both the parts are of equal $trength, but
notably weaker. But, in the Meridional Regions, far di$tant
from the Equinoctial, it changeth nature, and that part which to
us was more weak, acquireth more $trength than the other: and
all this I confer with that which we $ee to be done by a $mall
piece of Magnet, in the pre$ence of a great one, the vertue of
which $uperating the le$$er, maketh it to become obedient to it,
and according as it is held, either on this or on that $ide the Equi-
noctial of the great one, maketh the $elf $ame mutations,
which I have $aid are made by every Magnet, carried on this
<foot>$ide</foot>
<p n=>369</p>
$ide, or that $ide of the Equinoctiall of the Earth.</P>
<P>SAGR. I was per$waded, at the very fir$t reading of the Book
of <I>Gilbertus</I>; and having met with a mo$t excellent piece of

armed takes up
much more Iron,
than when unar-
med.</I></marg>
Magnet, I, for a long time, made many Ob$ervations, and all
worthy of extream wonder; but above all, that $eemeth to me
very $tupendious of increa$ing the faculty of taking up Iron $o
much by arming it, like as the $aid Authour teacheth; and with
arming that piece of mine, I multiplied its force in octuple propor-
tion; and whereas unarmed it $carce took up nine ounces of
Iron, it being armed did take up above $ix pounds: And, it
may be, you have $een this Load$tone in the ^{*} Gallery of your

<I>Mo$t Serene Grand Duke</I> (to whom I pre$ented it) upholding
two little Anchors of Iron.</P>
<P>SALV. I $aw it many times, and with great admiration, till
that a little piece of the like $tone gave me greater cau$e of won-
der, that is in the keeping of our Academick, which being no
more than of $ix ounces weight, and $u$taining, when unarmed,
hardly two ounces, doth, when armed, take up 160. ounces, $o
as that it is of 80. times more force armed than unarmed, and
takes up a weight 26. times greater than its own; a much greater
wonder than <I>Gilbert</I> could ever meet with, who writeth, that he
could never get any Load$tone that could reach to take up four
times its own weight.</P>
<P>SAGR. In my opinion, this Stone offers to the wit of man a
large Field to Phylo$ophate in; and I have many times thought
with my $elf, how it can be that it conferreth on that Iron, which
armeth it, a $trength $o $uperiour to its own; and finally, I finde
nothing that giveth me $atisfaction herein; nor do I find any
thing extraordinary in that which <I>Gilbert</I> writes about this parti-
cular; I know not whether the $ame may have befallen
you.</P>
<P>SALV. I extreamly prai$e, admire, and envy this Authour,
for that a conceit $o $tupendious $hould come into his minde,
touching a thing handled by infinite $ublime wits, and hit upon
by none of them: I think him moreover worthy of extraordi-
nary applau$e for the many new and true Ob$ervations that he
made, to the di$grace of $o many fabulous Authours, that write
not only what they do not know, but what ever they hear $po-
ken by the fooli$h vulgar, never $eeking to a$$ure them$elves of
the $ame by experience, perhaps, becau$e they are unwilling to
dimini$h the bulk of their Books. That which I could have de-
$ired in <I>Gilbert,</I> is, that he had been a little greater Mathematici-
an, and particularly well grounded in <I>Geometry,</I> the practice
whereof would have rendered him le$s re$olute in accepting tho$e
rea$ons for true Demon$trations, which he produceth for true
<foot>Aaa cau$es</foot>
<p n=>370</p>
cau$es of the true conclu$ions ob$erved by him$elf. Which rea-
$ons (freely $peaking) do not knit and bind $o fa$t, as tho$e un-
doubtedly ought to do, in that of natural, nece$$ary, and la$ting
conclu$ions may be alledged. And I doubt not, but that in pro-
ce$$e of time this new Science will be perfected with new ob$er-
vations, and, which is more, with true and nece$$ary Demon$tra-
<marg><I>The fir$t ob$er-
vers and inventers

tions. Nor ought the glory of the fir$t Inventor to be thereby
dimini$hed, nor do I le$$e e$teem, but rather more admire, the
Inventor of the Harp (although it may be $uppo$ed that the In-
$trument at fir$t was but rudely framed, and more rudely finger-
ed) than an hundred other Arti$ts, that in the in$uing Ages redu-
ced that profe$$ion to great perfection. And methinks, that An-
tiquity had very good rea$on to enumerate the fir$t Inventors of
the Noble Arts among$t the Gods; $eeing that the common wits
have $o little curio$ity, and are $o little regardful of rare and ele-
gant things, that though they $ee and hear them exercirated by
the exquifite profe$$ors of them, yet are they not thereby per-
$waded to a de$ire of learning them. Now judge, whether Capa-
cities of this kind would ever have attempted to have found out
the making of the Harp, or the invention of Mu$ick, upon the
hint of the whi$tling noi$e of the dry $inews of a Tortois, or
from the $triking of four Hammers. The application to great
inventions moved by $mall hints, and the thinking that under a
primary and childi$h appearance admirable Arts may lie hid, is
not the part of a trivial, but of a $uper-humane $pirit. Now an-
$wering to your demands, I $ay, that I al$o have long thought
upon what might po$$ibly be the cau$e of this $o tenacious and
potent union, that we $ee to be made between the one Iron that
armeth the Magnet, and the other that conjoyns it $elf unto it.
<marg><I>The true cau$e
of the multiplica-
tion of vertue in
the Magnet, by
means of the ar-
ming.</I></marg>
And fir$t, we are certain, that the vertue and $trength of the $tone
doth not augment by being armed, for it neither attracts at
greater di$tance, nor doth it hold an Iron the fa$ter, if between it,
and the arming or cap, a very fine paper, or a leaf of beaten gold,
be interpo$ed; nay, with that interpo$ition, the naked $tone
takes up more Iron than the armed. There is therefore no alte-
ration in the vertue, and yet there is an innovation in the effect.
<marg><I>Of a new effect
its nece$$ary that
the cau$e be like-
wi$e new.</I></marg>
And becau$e its nece$$ary, that a new effect have a new cau$e, if
it be inquired what novelty is introduced in the act of taking up
with the cap or arming, there is no mutation to be di$covered, but
in the different contact; for whereas before Iron toucht Load-
$tone, now Iron toucheth Iron. Therefore it is nece$$ary to con-
clude, that the diver$ity of contacts is the cau$e of the diver$ity
<marg><I>It is proved,
that Iron con$ists
of parts more $ub-
til, pure, and com-
pact than the mag-
net.</I></marg>
of effects. And for the difference of contacts it cannot, as I $ee,
be derived from any thing el$e, $ave from that the $ub$tance of
the Iron is of parts more $ubtil, more pure, and more compact-
<foot>ed</foot>
<p n=>371</p>
ed than tho$e of the Magnet, which are more gro$$e, impure, and
rare. From whence it followeth, that the $uperficies of two I-
rons that are to touch, by being exqui$itely plained, filed, and
burni$hed, do $o exactly conjoyn, that all the infinite points of
the one meet with the infinite points of the other; $o that the
filaments, if I may $o $ay, that collegate the two Irons, are many
more than tho$e that collegate the Magnet to the Iron, by rea$on
that the $ub$tance of the Magnet is more porous, and le$$e com-
pact, which maketh that all the points and filaments of the Load-
$tone do not clo$e with that which it unites unto. In the next
place, that the $ub$tance of Iron (e$pecially the well refined, as
namely, the pure$t $teel) is of parts much more den$e, $ubtil,
and pure than the matter of the Load$tone, is $een, in that one
may bring its edge to an extraordinary $harpne$$e, $uch as is that
of the Ra$or, which can never be in any great mea$ure effected in
a piece of Magnet. Then, as for the impurity of the Magnet, and

bundance, which, for their $mallne$$e, are imperceptible, that are
di$$eminated throughout the whole ma$$e. That which I $ay,
(namely, that the multitude of contacts that are made between
Iron and Iron, is the cau$e of the $o $olid conjunction) is con-
firmed by an experiment, which is this, that if we pre$ent the
$harpned point of a needle to the cap of a Magnet, it will $tick
no fa$ter to it, than to the $ame $tone unarmed: which can
proceed from no other cau$e, than from the equality of the con-
tacts that are both of one $ole point. But what then? Let a
^{*} Needle be taken and placed upon a Magnet, $o that one of its
<marg>* A common
$ewing needle.</marg>
extremities hang $omewhat over, and to that pre$ent a Nail; to
which the Needle will in$tantly cleave, in$omuch that withdraw-
ing the Nail, the Needle will $tand in $u$pen$e, and with its two
ends touching the Magnet and the Iron; and withdrawing the
Nail yet a little further, the Needle will for$ake the Magnet;
provided that the eye of the Needle be towards the Nail, and
the point towards the Magnet; but if the eye be towards the
Load$tone, in withdrawing the Nail the Needle will cleave to
the Magnet; and this, in my judgment, for no other rea$on,
$ave onely that the Needle, by rea$on it is bigger towards the
eye, toucheth in much more points than its $harp point doth.</P>

<P>SAGR. Your whole di$cour$e hath been in my judgment very
concluding, and this experiment of the Needle hath made me
think it little inferiour to a Mathematical Demon$tration; and
I ingenuou$ly confe$$e, that in all the Magnetick Philo$ophy, I
never heard or read any thing, that with $uch $trong rea$ons
gave account of its $o many admirable accidents, of which, if the
cau$es were with the $ame per$picuity laid open, I know not
what $weeter food our Intellects could de$ire.</P>
<P>SALV. In $eeking the rea$ons of conclu$ions unknown unto
us, it is requi$ite to have the good fortune to direct the di$-
cour$e from the very beginning towards the way of truth; in
which if any one walk, it will ea$ily happen, that one $hall meet
with $everal other Propo$itions known to be true, either by di$-
putes or experiments, from the certainty of which the truth of
ours acquireth $trength and evidence; as it did in every re$pect
happen to me in the pre$ent Probleme, for being de$irous to a$-
$ure my $elf, by $ome other accident, whether the rea$on of the
Propo$ition, by me found, were true; namely, whether the $ub-
$tance of the Magnet were really much le$$e continuate than that
of Iron or of Steel, I made the Arti$ts that work in the Gallery
of my Lord the Grand Duke, to $mooth one $ide of that piece
of Magnet, which formerly was yours, and then to poli$h and
burni$h it; upon which to my $atisfaction I found what I de$ired.
For I di$covered many $pecks of colour different from the re$t,
but as $plendid and bright, as any of the harder $ort of $tones;
the re$t of the Magnet was polite, but to the tact onely, not
being in the lea$t $plendid; but rather as if it were $meered over
with $oot; and this was the $ub$tance of the Load $tone, and
the $hining part was the fragments of other $tones intermixt
therewith, as was $en$ibly made known by pre$enting the face
thereof to filings of Iron, the which in great number leapt to
the Load-$tone, but not $o much as one grain did $tick to the
$aid $pots, which were many, $ome as big as the fourth part of
the nail of a mans finger, others $omewhat le$$er, the lea$t of
all very many, and tho$e that were $carce vi$ible almo$t innu-
merable. So that I did a$$ure my $elf, that my conjecture was
true, when I fir$t thought that the $ub$tance of the Magnet
was not clo$e and compact, but porous, or to $ay better, $pon-
gy; but with this difference, that whereas the $ponge in its
cavities and little cels conteineth Air or Water, the Magnet hath
its pores full of hard and heavy $tone, as appears by the exqui-
$ite lu$tre which tho$e $pecks receive. Whereupon, as I have $aid
from the beginning, applying the $urface of the Iron to the $u-
perficies of the Magnet the minute particles of the Iron, though
perhaps more continuate than the$e of any other body (as its
<foot>$hining</foot>
<p n=>373</p>
$hining more than any other matter doth $hew) do not all, nay
but very few of them incounter pure Magnet; and the contacts
being few, the union is but weak. But becau$e the cap of the
Load-$tone, be$ides the contact of a great part of its $uperficies,
inve$ts its $elf al$o with the virtue of the parts adjoyning, al-
though they touch not; that $ide of it being exactly $moothed
to which the other face, in like manner well poli$ht of the Iron to
be attracted, is applyed, the contact is made by innumera-
ble minute particles, if not haply by the infinite points of both
the $uperficies, whereupon the union becometh very $trong.
This ob$ervation of $moothing the $urfaces of the Irons that are
to touch, came not into the thoughts of <I>Gilbert,</I> for he makes
the Irons convex, $o that their contact is very $mall; and there-
upon it cometh to pa$$e that the tenacity, wherewith tho$e Irons
conjoyn, is much le$$er.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am, as I told you before, little le$$e $atisfied with
this rea$on, that if it were a pure Geometrical Demon$tration;
and becau$e we $peak of a Phy$ical Problem, I believe that al$o
<I>Simplicius</I> will find him$elf $atisfied as far as natural $cience ad-
mits, in which he knows that Geometrical evidence is not to be
required.</P>
<P>SIMP. I think indeed, that <I>Salviatus</I> with a fine circumlo-
<marg>Sympathy <I>and</I>
Antipathy, <I>terms
u$ed by Philo$o-
phers to give a rea-
$on ea$ily of ma-

cution hath $o manife$tly di$played the cau$e of this effect, that
any indifferent wit, though not ver$t in the Sciences, may ap-
prehend the $ame; but we, confining our $elves to the terms of
Art, reduce the cau$e of the$e and other the like natural effects
to <I>Sympathy,</I> which is a certain agreement and mutual appetite
which ari$eth between things that are $emblable to one another
in qualities; as likewi$e on the contrary that hatred &amp; enmity for
which other things $hun &amp; abhor one another we call <I>Antipathy.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. And thus with the$e two words men come to render
rea$ons of a great number of accidents and effects which we $ee
not without admiration to be produced in nature. But this kind
of philo$ophating $eems to me to have great $ympathy with a

was that we were upon when we fell into this magnetick di$-

$cribed by <I>Copernicus</I> to the Earth to be no motion but a quie-
$cence and maintaining of it $elf immutably directed with its de-
terminate parts towards the $ame &amp; determinate parts of the Uni-
ver$e, that is a perpetual con$ervation of the Axis of its diurnal
revolution parallel to it $elf, and looking towards $uch and $uch
fixed $tars; which mo$t con$tant po$ition we $aid did naturally
agree with every librated body $u$pended in a fluid and yielding
<I>medium,</I> which although carried about, yet did it not change di-
rectionin re$pect of things external, but onely $eemed to revolve in
its $elf, in re$pect of that which carryed it round, and to the
ve$$el in which it was tran$ported. And then we added to this
$imple and natural accident the magnetick virtue, whereby the
$elf Terre$trial Globe might $o much the more con$tantly keep it
immutable, -----</P>
<P>SAGR. Now I remember the whole bu$ine$$e; and that which
then came into my minde, &amp; which I would have intimated, was a
certain con$ideration touching the $cruple and objection of <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> which he propounded again$t the mobility of the Earth,
<marg><I>The $everal na-
tural motions of
the Magnet.</I></marg>
taken from the multiplicity of motions, impo$$ible to be a$$igned
to a $imple body, of which but one $ole and $imple motion, ac-
cording to the doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I> can be natural; and that
which I would have propo$ed to con$ideration, was the Magnet,
to which we manife$tly $ee three motions naturally to agree:
one towards the centre of the Earth, as a <I>Grave</I>; the $econd is
the circular Horizontal Motion, whereby it re$tores and con-
$erves its Axis towards determinate parts of the Univer$e; and
the third is this, newly di$covered by <I>Gilbert,</I> of inclining its
Axis, being in the plane of a Meridian towards the $urface of the
Earth, and this more and le$$e, according as it $hall be di$tant
from the Equinoctial, under which it is parallel to the Axis of
the Earth. Be$ides the$e three, it is not perhaps improbable,
but that it may have a fourth, of revolving upon its own Axis, in
ca$e it were librated and $u$pended in the air or other fluid and
yielding <I>Medium,</I> $o that all external and accidental impediments
were removed, and this opinion <I>Gilbert</I> him$elf $eemeth al$o to
applaud. So that, <I>Simplicius,</I> you $ee how tottering the Axiome
of <I>Ari$totle</I> is.</P>
<P>SIMP. This doth uot only not make again$t the Maxime, but
not $o much as look towards it: for that he $peaketh of a fimple
body, and of that which may naturally con$i$t therewith; but
you propo$e that which befalleth a mixt body; nor do you tell
us of any thing that is new to the doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I> for that

<P>SAGR. Stay a little, <I>Simplicius,</I> &amp; an$wer me to the que$tions
I $hall ask you. You $ay that the Load-$tone is no $imple body,
<marg>Ari$tole <I>grants
a compound motion
to mixt bodies.</I></marg>
now I defire you to tell me what tho$e $imple bodies are, that
mingle in compo$ing the Load-$tone.</P>
<P>SIMP. I know not how to tell you th'ingredients nor $imples
preci$ely, but it $ufficeth that they are things elementary.</P>
<P>SALV. So much $ufficeth me al$o. And of the$e $imple ele-
mentary bodies, what are the natural motions?</P>
<P>SIMP. They are the two right and $imple motions, <I>$ur$um</I>
and <I>deor$um.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Tell me in the next place? Do you believe that the
motion, that $hall remain natural to that $ame mixed body, $hould
be one that may re$ult from the compo$ition of the two $imple
natural motions of the $imple bodies compounding, or that it
may be a motion impo$$ible to be compo$ed of them.</P>
<marg><I>The motion of
mixt bodies ought
to be $uch as may

<P>SIMP. I believe that it $hall move with the motion re$ulting
from the compo$ition of the motions of the $imple bodies com-

the$e, it is impo$$ible that it $hould move.</P>
<P>SAGR. But, <I>Simplicius,</I> with two right and $imple motions, you
$hall never be able to compo$e a circular motion, $uch as are the

that the Magnet
is compounded of
c&oelig;le$tial $ub$tan-

better, the ill-inferred con$equences of good Principles carry a
man; for you are now forced to $ay, that the Magnet is a mix-
ture compounded of $ub$tances elementary and c&oelig;le$tial, if you
will maintain that the $traight motion is a peculiar to the Ele-
ments, and the circular to the c&oelig;le$tial bodies. Therefore if
you will more $afely argue, you mu$t $ay, that of the integral
bodies of the Univer$e, tho$e that are by nature moveable, do all
move circularly, and that therefore the Magnet, as a part of the

true primary, and integral $ub$tance of our Globe, pertaketh of
the $ame qualities with it. And take notice of this your fallacy,
in calling the Magnet a mixt body, and the Terre$trial Globe a
$imple body, which is $en$ibly perceived to be a thou$and times
more compound: for, be$ides that it containeth an hundred an
hundred matters, exceeding different from one another, it con-
taineth great abundance of this which you call mixt, I mean
of the Load-$tone. This $eems to me ju$t as if one $hould call

of the Peripateticks, who grant (nor can it be denied) that our
Terre$trial Globe is, <I>de facto,</I> a compound of infinite different
matters; and grant farther that of compound bodies the motion
ought to be compound: now the motions that admit of compo-
$ition are the right and circular: For the two right motions, as
being contrary, are incompatible together, they affirm, that the
pure Element of Earth is no where to be found; they confe$$e,
that it never hath been moved with a local motion; and yet they
will introduce in Nature that body which is not to be found, and
make it move with that motion which it never exerci$ed, nor ne-
ver $hall do, and to that body which hath, and ever had a being,
they deny that motion, which before they granted, ought natu-
rally to agree therewith.</P>
<P>SALV. I be$eech you, <I>Sagredus,</I> let us not weary our $elves
any more about the$e particulars, and the rather, becau$e you
know that our purpo$e was not to determine re$olutely, or to
accept for true, this or that opinion, but only to propo$e for our
diverti$ement $uch rea$ons, and an$wers as may be alledged on
the one $ide, or on the other; and <I>Simplicius</I> maketh this an-
$wer, in defence of his Peripateticks, therefore let us leave the
judgment in $u$pen$e, and remit the determination into the
hands of $uch as are more known than we. And becau$e I think
that we have, with $ufficient prolixity, in the$e three dayes, di$-
cour$ed upon the Sy$teme of the Univer$e, it will now be $ea$o-
nable, that we proceed to the grand accident, from whence our
Di$putations took beginning, I mean, of the ebbing and flowing
of the Sea, the cau$e whereof may, in all probability, be referred
to the motion of the Earth. But that, if you $o plea$e, we will
re$erve till to morrow. In the mean time, that I may not forget
it, I will $peak to one particular, to which I could have wi$hed,
that <I>Gilbert</I> had not lent an ear; I mean that of admitting, that
<marg><I>An improba-
ble effect admired
by</I> Gilbertus <I>in the
Load$tone.</I></marg>
in ca$e a little Sphere of Load$tone might be exactly librated, it
would revolve in it $elf; becau$e there is no rea$on why it $hould
do $o; For if the whole Terre$trial Globe hath a natural facul-
ty of revolving about its own centre in twenty four hours, and
that all its parts ought to have the $ame, I mean, that faculty of
turning round together with their <I>whole,</I> about its centre in twen-
ty four hours; they already have the $ame in effect, whil$t that,
being upon the Earth, they turn round along with it: And the
a$$igning them a revolution about their particular centres, would
be to a$cribe unto them a $econd motion much different from the
fir$t; for $o they would have two, namely, the revolving in twen-
ty four hours about the centre of their <I>whole</I>; and the turning
about their own: now this $econd is arbitrary, nor is there any
<foot>rea-</foot>
<p n=>377</p>
rea$on for the introducing of it: If by pluoking away a piece
of Load$tone from the whole natural ma$$d, it were deprived of
the faculty of following it, as it did, whil$t it was unitedy thereto,
$o that it is thereby deprived of the revodution about the univer-
$al centre of the Terre$trial Globe, it might Chaply, with $ome-
what greater probability be thought by $ome, that the $aid Mag-
net was to appropriate to it $elf a new conver$ion about its parti-
cular centre; but if it do no le$$e, when $eparated, than when
conjoyned, continue always to pur$ue its fir$t, eternal, and natu-
ral cour$e, to what purpo$e $hould we go about to obtrude upon
it another new one?</P>
<P>SAGR. I under$tand you very well, and this puts me in mind
of a Di$cour$e very like to this for the vanity of it, falling from

certain Writers upon the Sphere, and I think, if I well remem-

pleat Spherical Figure, and $o between them both compo$e this
our Globe, writeth, that the $eeing the $mall ^{*} particles of water
$hape them$elves into rotundity, as in the drops, and in the dew
daily apparent upon the leaves of $everal herbs, is a $trong ar-
gument; and becau$e, according to the trite Axiome, there is
the $ame rea$on for the whole, as for the parts, the parts affecting
that $ame figure, it is nece$$ary that the $ame is proper to the
whole Element: and truth is, methinks it is a great over$ight
that the$e men $hould not perceive $o apparent a vanity, and con-
$ider that if their argument had run right, it would have follow-
ed, that not only the $mall drops, but that any what$oever greater
quantity of water $eparated from the whole Element, $hould be re-
duced into a Globe: Which is not $een to happen; though indeed
the Sen$es may $ee, and the Under$tanding perceive that the E-
lement of Water loving to form it $elf into a Spherical Figure
about the common centre of gravity, to which all grave bo-
dies tend (that is, the centre of the Terre$trial Globe) it
therein is followed by all its parts, according to the Axiome;
$o that all the $urfaces of Seas, Lakes, Pools, and in a word,
of all the parts of Waters conteined in ve$$els, di$tend
them$elves into a Spherical Figure, but that Figure is an arch
of that Sphere that hath for its centre the centre of the Ter-

Sun and Firmament is commonly inferred, are to $eem to us per-

<P>SALV. Becau$e in natural que$tions, of which number this
which we have in hand is one, the knowledge of the effects is a
means to guide us to the inve$tigation and di$covery of the cau-

more uncertainty, for that we know not whither we would go,
whereas the blind, at lea$t, know where they de$ire to arrive; there-

as one, that be$ides your being born, and having, for a long

greatne$$e, have al$o $ailed into <I>Syria,</I> and, as an ingenuous and
apprehen$ive wit, mu$t needs have made many Ob$ervations up-
on this $ubject: whereas I, that could onely for a time, and that
very $hort, ob$erve what happened in the$e extream parts of the
<I>Adriatick</I> Gulph, and in our Seas below about the <I>Tyrrhene</I>
$hores, mu$t needs take many things upon the relation of o-
thers, who, for the mo$t part, not very well agreeing, and con-
$equently being very uncertain, contribute more of confu$ion
than confirmation to our $peculations. Neverthele$$e, from tho$e
that we are $ure of, and which are the principal, I think I am a-

to be able to produce all the proper and adequate rea$ons of
tho$e effects that are new unto me, and which con$equently I
could never have thought upon. And that which I have to $ay,
I propo$e only, as a key that openeth the door to a path never
yet trodden by any, in certain hope, that $ome wits more $pecu-
lative than mine, will make a further progre$$e herin, and pene-
trate much farther than I $hall have done in this my fir$t Di$co-
very: And although that in other Seas, remote from us, there may
happen $everal accidents, which do not happen in our Mediter-
ranean Sea, yet doth not this invalidate the rea$on and cau$e that
I $hall produce, if $o be that it veri$ie and fully re$olve the ac-
cidents which evene in our Sea: for that in conclu$ion there can
be but one true and primary cau$e of the effects that are of the
$ame kind. I will relate unto you, therefore, the effects that I
know to be true, and a$$igne the cau$es thereof that I think
to be true, and you al$o, Gentlemen, $hall produce $uch
others as are known to you, be$ides mine, and then we will
try whether the cau$e, by me alledged, may $atisfie them
al$o.</P>
<marg><I>Three Periods
of ebbings and
flowings, diurnal,
monethly, and an-
nual.</I></marg>
<P>I therefore affirm the periods that are ob$erved in the fluxes
and refluxes of the Sea-waters to be three: the fir$t and princi-
pal is this great and mo$t obvious one; namely, the diurnal, accor-
ding to which the intervals of $ome hours with the waters flow and
ebbe; and the$e intervals are, for the mo$t part, in the Mediter-
rane from $ix hours to $ix hours, or thereabouts, that is, they for
$ix hours flow, and for $ix hours ebbe. The $econd period is
monethly, and it $eemes to take its origen from the motion of
the Moon, not that it introduceth other motions, but only al-
tereth the greatne$$e of tho$e before mentioned, with a notable
difference, according as it $hall wax or wane, or come to the
Quadrature with the Sun. The third Period is annual, and is
$een to depend on the Sunne, and onely altereth the diurnal
<foot>motions,</foot>
<p n=>382</p>
motions, by making them different in the times of the Sol-
$tices, as to greatne$$e, from what they are in the Equinoxes.</P>
<P>We will $peak (in the fir$t place, of the diurnal motion, as
being the principal, and upon which the Moon and Sun $eem to
exerci$e their power $econdarily, in their monethly and annual
<marg><I>Varieties that
happen in the diur-
nal period.</I></marg>
alterations. Three differences are ob$ervable in the$e horary
mutations; for in $ome places the waters ri$e and fall, without
making any progre$$ive motion; in others, without ri$ing or fal-
ling they run one while towards the Ea$t, and recur another
while towards the We$t; and in others they vary the heights
and cour$e al$o, as happeneth here in <I>Venice,</I> where the Tides in
coming in ri$e, and in going out fall; and this they do in the ex-
termities of the lengths of Gulphs that di$tend from We$t to
Ea$t, and terminate in open $hores, up along which $hores the
Tide at time of flood hath room to extend it $elf: but if the
courfe of the Tide were iutercepted by Cliffes and Banks of
great height and $teepne$$e, there it will flow and ebbe without
any progre$$ive motion. Again, it runs to and again, without
changing height in the middle parts of the Mediterrane, as nota-
<marg>* A Strait, $o
called.</marg>
bly happeneth in the ^{*} <I>Faro de Me$$ina,</I> between <I>Scylla</I> and <I>Ca-
rybdis,</I> where the Currents, by rea$on of the narrowne$$e of
the Channel, are very $wift; but in the more open Seas, and
about the I$les that $tand farther into the Mediterranean Sea, as
<marg>* Or Ilva.</marg>
the <I>Baleares, Cor$ica, Sardignia, ^{*} Elba, Sicily</I> towards the <I>Affrican</I>
<marg>* Or Creta.</marg>
Coa$ts, <I>Malta, ^{*} Candia, &amp;c.</I> the changes of watermark are
very $mall; but the currents indeed are very notable, and e$pe-
cially when the Sea is pent between I$lands, or between them
and the Continent.</P>
<P>Now the$e onely true and certain effects, were there no more
to be ob$erved, do, in my judgment, very probably per$wade
any man, that will contain him$elf within the bounds of natu-
ral cau$es, to grant the mobility of the Earth: for to make the
ve$$el (as it may be called) of the Mediterrane $tand $till, and to
make the water contained therein to do, as it doth, exceeds my
imagination, and perhaps every mans el$e, who will but pierce
beyond the rinde in the$e kind of inquiries.</P>
<P>SIMP. The$e accidents, <I>Salviatus,</I> begin not now, they are
mo$t ancient, and have been ob$erved by very many, and $everal
have attempted to a$$igne, $ome one, $ome another cau$e for the

Moon are many, $aying that $he hath particular Dominion over
the Water; and at la$t a certain Prelate hath publi$hed a little
Treati$e, wher in he $aith that the Moon wandering too and
fro in the Heavens attracteth and draweth towards it a Ma$$e of
Water, which goeth continually following it, $o that it is full Sea

retain this faculty in her $elf; but in this ca$e hath power to con-

<I>dus,</I> will $pend a few words in favour of <I>Simplicius,</I> if haply
he thinks that any probability is to be found in tho$e things that
he hath related. I $ay therefore: The Waters, <I>Simplicius,</I> that
have their exteriour $uperficies higher, repel tho$e that are infe-
riour to them, and lower; but $o do not tho$e Waters that are
of greate$t profundity; and the higher having once driven back
the lower, they in a $hort time grow quiet and ^{*} level. This
<marg>+ Or rather
$mooth.</marg>
your <I>Peripatetick</I> mu$t needs be of an opinion, that all the Lakes
in the World that are in a calme, and that all the Seas where
the ebbing and flowing is in$en$ible, are level in their bottoms;
but I was $o $imple, that I per$waded my $elf that had we no o-

ther plummet to $ound with, the I$les that advance $o high a-
bove Water, had been a $ufficient evidence of the unevenne$$e
of their bottomes. To that Prelate I could $ay that the Moon
runneth every day along the whole Mediterrane, and yet its
Waters do not ri$e thereupon $ave onely in the very extream
bounds of it Ea$tward, and here to us at <I>Venice.</I> And for tho$e
that make the Moons temperate heat able to make the Water
$well, bid them put fire under a Kettle full of Water, and hold
<foot>their</foot>
<p n=>384</p>
their right hand therein till that the Water by rea$on of the heat
do ri$e but one $ole inch, and then let them take it out, and
write off the tumefaction of the Sea. Or at lea$t de$ire them to
$hew you how the Moon doth to rarefie a certain part of the
Waters, and not the remainder; as for in$tance, the$e here of

<marg><I>Poetick wits of
two kinds.</I></marg>
Poetick Wits are of two kinds, $ome are ready and apt to
invent Fables, and others di$po$ed and inclined to believe them.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe that no man believeth Fables, $o long as he
knows them to be $o; and of the opinions concerning the cau$es
of ebbing and flowing, which are many, becau$e I know that of
one $ingle effect there is but one $ingle cau$e that is true and pri-
mary, I under$tand very well, and am certain that but one alone
at the mo$t can be true, and for all the re$t I am $ure that they are
fabulous, and fal$e; and its po$$ible that the true one may not be
among tho$e that have been hitherto produced; nay I verily be-
lieve that it is not, for it would be very $trange that the truth
<marg><I>Truth hath not
$o little light as

ed amid$t the um-
brages of fal-

$hould have $o little light, as that it $hould not be vi$ible among$t
the umbrages of $o many fal$hoods. But this I $hall $ay with the
liberty that is permitted among$t us, that the introduction of the
Earths motion, and the making it the cau$e of the ebbing and
flowing of Tides, $eemeth to me as yet a conjecture no le$$e fa-
bulous than the re$t of tho$e that I have heard; and if there
$hould not be propo$ed to me rea$ons more conformable to natu-
ral matters, I would without any more ado proceed to believe
this to be a $upernatural effect, and therefore miraculous, and
un$earchable to the under$tandings of men, as infinite others there
are, that immediately depend on the Omnipotent hand of God.</P>
<marg>Ari$totle <I>holdeth
tho$e effects to be
miraculous, of
which the cau$es
are unknown.</I></marg>
<P>SAGR. You argue very prudently, and according to the
Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I> who you know in the beginning of his
mechanical que$tions referreth tho$e things to a Miracle, the
cau$es whereof are occult. But that the cau$e of the ebbing and
flowing is one of tho$e that are not to be found out, I believe
you have no greater proof than onely that you $ee, that among$t
all tho$e that have hitherto been produced for true cau$es there-
of, there is not one wherewith, working by what artifice you
will, we are able to repre$ent $uch an effect; in regard that nei-
ther with the light of the Moon nor of the Sun, nor with
temperate heats, nor with different profundities, $hall one ever
artificially make the Water conteined in an immoveable Ve$$el
to run one way or another, and to ebbe and flow in one place,
and not in another. But if without any other artifice, but with
the onely moving of the Ve$$el, I am able punctually to repre-
$ent all tho$e mutations that are ob$erved in the Sea Water, why
will you refu$e this rea$on and run to a Miracle?</P>
<foot>SIMP</foot>
<p n=>385</p>
<P>SIMP. I will run to a Miracle $till, if you do not with $ome
other natural cau$es, be$ides that of the motion of the Ve$$els of
the Sea-water di$$wade me from it; for I know that tho$e Ve$$els
move not, in regard that all the entire Terre$trial Globe is natu-
rally immoveable.</P>
<P>SALV. But do not you think, that the Terre$trial Globe might
$upernaturally, that is, by the ab$olute power of God, be made
moveable? SIMP. Who doubts it?</P>
<P>SALV. Then <I>Simplicius,</I> $eeing that to make the flux and
reflux of the Sea, it is nece$$ary to introduce a Miracle, let us
$uppo$e the Earth to move miraculou$ly, upon the motion of
which the Sea moveth naturally: and this effect $hall be al$o the
more $imple, and I may $ay natural, among$t the miraculous o-
perations, in that the making a Globe to move round, of which
kind we $ee many others to move, is le$$e difficult than to make
an immen$e ma$$e of water go forwards and backwards, in one
place more $wiftly, and in another le$$e, and to ri$e and fall in
$ome places more; in $ome le$$e, and in $ome not at all: and to
work all the$e different effects in one and the $ame Ve$$el that
containeth it: be$ides, that the$e are $everal Miracles, and that
is but one onely. And here it may be added, that the Miracle
of making the water to move is accompanied with another,
namely, the holding of the Earth $tedfa$t again$t impetuosities
of the water, able to make it $wage $ometimes one way, and
$ometimes another, if it were not miraculou$ly kept to rights.</P>
<P>SAGR. Good <I>Simplicius,</I> let us for the pre$ent $u$pend our
judgement about $entencing the new opinion to be vain that <I>Sal-
viatus</I> is about to explicate unto us, nor let us $o ha$tily flye out
into pa$$ion like the $colding overgrown Haggs: and as for the
Miracle, we may as well recurre to it when we have done hea-
ring the Di$cour$es contained within the bounds of natural cau-
$es: though to $peak freely, all the Works of nature, or rather
of God, are in my judgement miraculous.</P>
<P>SALV. And I am of the $ame opinion; nor doth my $aying,
that the motion of the Earth is the Natural cau$e of the ebbing
and flowing, hinder, but that the $aid motion of the Earth may
be miraculous. Now rea$$uming our Argument, I apply, and
once again affirm, that it hath been hitherto unknown how it
might be that the Waters contained in our Mediterranean
Straights $hould make tho$e motions, as we $ee it doth, if $o be
the $aid Straight, or containing Ve$$el were immoveable. And
that which makes the difficulty, and rendreth this matter inextri-
cable, are the things which I am about to $peak of, and which
are daily ob$erved. Therefore lend me your attention.</P>

bly entred by the Channels and Mouth of the ^{*} <I>Lio.</I> Con$ider
now, how and from whence it came thither. Are there happly
hereabouts any Gulphs or Whirle pools in the bottom of the
Sea, by which the Earth drinketh in and $pueth out the Water,
breathing as it were a great and mon$truous Whale? But if this
be $o, how comes it that the Water doth not flow in the $pace of
$ix hours in <I>Ancona,</I> in ^{*} <I>Ragu$a,</I> in <I>Corfu,</I> where the Tide is ve-
ry $mall, and happly unob$ervable? Who will invent a way to
pour new Water into an immoveable Ve$$el, and to make that
it ri$e onely in one determinate part of it, and in other places
not? Will you $ay, that this new Water is borrowed from the
Ocean, being brought in by the Straight of <I>Gibraltar</I>? This
will not remove the doubt afore$aid, but will beget a greater.
And fir$t tell me what ought to be the current of that Water,
that entering at the Straights mouth, is carried in $ix hours to
the remote$t Creeks of the Mediterrane, at a di$tance of two
or three thou$and Miles, and that returneth the $ame $pace again
in a like time at its going back? What would Ships do that lye out
at Sea? What would become of tho$e that $hould be in the
Straights-mouth in a continual precipice of a va$t accumulation of
Waters, that entering in at a Channel but eight Mile, broad, is to
give admittance to $o much Water as in $ix hours over-floweth a
tract of many hundred Miles broad, &amp; thou$ands in length? What
Tygre, what Falcon runneth or flyeth with $o much $wiftne$s?
With the $wiftne$s, I $ay, of above 400 Miles an hour. The cur-
rents run (nor can it be denied) the long-wayes of the Gulph, but
$o $lowly, as that a Boat with Oars will out-go them, though in-
deed not without defalking for their wanderings. Moreover, if this
Water come in at the Straight, the other doubt yet remaineth,
namely, how it cometh to flow here $o high in a place $o remote,
without fir$t ri$ing a like or greater height in the parts more adja-
cent? In a word, I cannot think that either ob$tinacy, or $harpne$s
of wit can ever find an an$wer to the$e Objections, nor con$e-
quently to maintain the $tability of the Earth again$t them, keep-
ing within the bounds of Nature.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>387</p>
<P>SAGR. I have all the while perfectly apprehended you in this;
and I $tand greedily attending to hear in what manner the$e won-
ders may occur without ob$truction from the motion already a$-
$igned to the Earth.</P>
<P>SALV. The$e effects being to en$ue in con$equence of the mo-
tions that naturally agree with the Earth, it is nece$$ary that they
not onely meet with no impediment or ob$tacle, but that they do
follow ea$ily, &amp; not onely that they follow with facility, but with
nece$$ity, $o as that it is impo$$ible that it $hould $ucceed otherwi$e,
for $uch is the property &amp; condition of things natural &amp; true. Ha-
<marg><I>True and natu-
ral effects follow
without difficulty.</I></marg>
ving therefore $hewen the impo$$ibility of rendring a rea$on of the
motions di$cerned in the Waters, &amp; at the $ame time to maintain
the immobility of the ve$$el that containeth them: we may proceed
to enquire, whether the mobility of the Container may produce
the required effect, in the manner that it is ob$erved to evene.</P>
<P>Two kinds of motions may be conferred upon a Ve$$el, where-
<marg><I>Two $orts of
motions of the con-
taining Ve$$el, may
make the contai-
ned water to ri$e
and fall.</I></marg>
by the Water therein contained, may acquire a faculty of flu-
ctuating in it, one while towards one $ide, and another while
towards another; and there one while to ebbe, and another
while to flow. The fir$t is, when fir$t one, and then another of
tho$e $ides is declined, for then the Water running towards the
inclining $ide, will alternately be higher and lower, $ometimes
on one $ide, and $ometimes on another. But becau$e that this
ri$ing and abating is no other than a rece$$ion and acce$$ion to the
centre of the Earth, $uch a motion cannot be a$cribed to the Cavi-
ties of the $aid Earth, that are the Ve$$els which contain the Wa-
ters; the parts of which Ve$$el cannot by any what$oever motion
a$$igned to the Earth, be made to approach or recede from the
<marg><I>The Cavities of
the Earth cannot
approach or go far-
ther from the cen-
tre of the $ame.</I></marg>
centre of the $ame: The other $ort of motion is, when the
Ve$$el moveth (without inclining in the lea$t) with a progre$$ive
motion, not uniform, but that changeth velocity, by $ometimes
accellerating, and other times retarding: from which di$parity
<marg><I>The progpe$$ive
and uneven motion
may make the wa-
ter contained in a
Ve$$el to run to
and fro.</I></marg>
it would follow, that the Water contained in the Ve$$el its true,
but not fixed fa$t to it, as its other $olid parts, but by rea$on of
its fluidity, as if it were $eparated and at liberty, and not obli-
ged to follow all the mutations of its Container, in the retardation
of the Ve$$el, it keeping part of the <I>impetus</I> before conceived,
would run towards the the preceding part, whereupon it would
of nece$$ity come to ri$e; and on the contrary, if new velocity
$hould be added to the Ve$$el, with retaining parts of its tardity,
$taying $omewhat behind, before it could habituate it $elf to the
new <I>impetus,</I> it would hang back towards the following part,
where it would come to ri$e $omething. The which effects we
may plainly declare and make out to the Sen$e by the example of
one of tho$e $ame Barks yonder, which continually come from
<foot>Ccc 2 ^{*} <I>Lizza-</I></foot>
<p n=>388</p>
<marg>+ A Town ly-
ing S. E. of <I>Venice</I></marg>
^{*} <I>Lizza-Fu$ina,</I> laden with fre$h water, for the $ervice of the City.
Let us therefore fancy one of tho$e Barks, to come from thence
with moderate velocity along the Lake, carrying the water gently,
of which it is full: and then either by running a ground, or by
$ome other impediment that it $hall meet with, let it be notably
retarded. The water therein contained $hall not, by that means,
lo$e, as the Bark doth, its pre-conceived <I>impetus,</I> but retaining
the $ame, $hall run forwards towards the prow, where it $hall
ri$e notably, falling as much a $tern. But if, on the contrary,
the $aid Bark, in the mid$t of its $mooth cour$e, $hall have a new
velocity, with notable augmentation added to it, the water con-
tained before it can habituate it $elf thereto, continuing in its
tardity, $hall $tay behinde, namely a $tern, where of con$e-
quence it $hall mount, and abate for the $ame at the prow. This
effect is undoubted and manife$t, and may hourly be experimen-
ted; in which I de$ire that for the pre$ent three particulars may
be noted. The flr$t is, that to make the water to ri$e on one
$ide of the ve$$el, there is no need of new water, nor that it run
thither, for$aking the other $ide. The $econd is, that the water
in the middle doth not ri$e or fall notably, unle$$e the cour$e of
the Bark were not before that very $wift, and the $hock or other
arre$t that held it exceeding $trong and $udden, in which ca$e its
po$$ible, that not only all the water might run forwards, but
that the greater part thereof might i$$ue forth of the Bark: and
the $ame al$o would en$ue, whil$t that being under $ail in a
$mooth cour$e, a mo$t violent <I>impetus</I> $hould, upon an in$tant,
overtake it: But when to its calme motion there is added a mo-
derate retardation or incitation, the middle parts (as I $aid) un-
ob$ervedly ri$e and fall: and the other parts, according as they
are neerer to the middle, ri$e the le$$e; and the more remote,
more. The third is, that whereas the parts about the mid$t do
make little alteration in ri$ing and falling, in re$pect of the wa-
ters of the $ides; on the contrary, they run forwards and back-
wards very much, in compari$on of the extreams. Now, my
Ma$ters, that which the Bark doth, in re$pect of the water by it
contained, and that which the water contained doth, in re-
$pect of the Bark its container, is the $elf-$ame, to an hair, with
that which the Mediterranean Ve$$el doth, in re$pect of the wa-
ters in it contained, and that which the waters contained do, in

that it may the more ea$ily be under$tood, I will explain, by
drawing a Scheme thereof. And fir$t, about the centre A [<I>in
Fig. 1. of this Dialogue</I>] I will de$cribe the circumference of
<marg><I>The parts of a
Circle regularly
moved about its

divers times with
contrary motions.</I></marg>
the Grand Orb B C, in which any point being taken, as B,
about it as a centre we will de$cribe this le$$er circle D E F G,
repre$enting the Terre$trial Globe; the which we will $uppo$e
to run thorow the whole circumference of the Grand Orb, with
its centre B, from the We$t towards the Ea$t, that is, from the
part B towards C; and moreover we will $uppo$e the Terre-
$trial Globe to turn about its own centre B likewi$e from We$t
to Ea$t, that is, according to the $ucce$$ion of the points
D E F G, in the $pace of twenty four hours. But here we
ought carefully to note, that a circle turning round upon its
own centre, each part of it mu$t, at different times, move with
contrary motions: the which is manife$t, con$idering that whil$t
the parts of the circumference, about the point D move to the
left hand, that is, towards E, the oppo$ite parts that are about F,
approach to the right hand, that is, towards G; $o that when
the parts D $hall be in F, their motion $hall be contrary to what
it was before. when it was in D. Furthermore, the $ame time
that the parts E de$cend, if I may $o $peak, towards F, tho$e in
G a$cend towards D. It being therefore pre$uppo$ed, that

there are $uch contrarieties of motions in the parts of the Terre-
$trial Surface, whil$t it turneth round upon its own centre, it is
nece$$ary, that in conjoyning this Diurnal Motion, with the other
Annual, there do re$ult an ab$olute motion for the parts of the
$aid Terre$trial Superficies, one while very accelerate, and ano-
ther while as $low again. The which is manife$t, con$idering
fir$t the parts about D, the ab$olute motion of which $hall be
extream $wift, as that which proceedeth from two motions made
both one way, namely, towards the left hand; the fir$t of
which is part of the Annual Motion, common to all the parts of
the Globe, the other is that of the $aid point D., carried likewi$e
to the left, by the Diurnal Revolution; $o that, in this ca$e, the
Diurnal motion increa$eth and accelerateth the Annual. The
contrary to which happeneth in the oppo$ite part F, which, whil$t
it is by the common annual motion carried, together with the
whole Globe, towards the left, it happeneth to be carried by the
Diurnal conver$ion al$o towards the right: $o that the Diur-
nal motion by that means detracteth from the Annual, where-
upon the ab$olute motion, re$ulting from the compo$ition of both
the other, is much retarded. Again, about the points E and G,
the ab$olute motion becometh in a manner equal to the $imple
Annual one, in regard that little or nothing increa$eth or dimi-
ni$heth it, as not tending either to the left hand, or to the right,
but downwards and upwards. We will conclude therefore, that
like as it is true, that the motion of the whole Globe, and of
each of its parts, would be equal and uniforme, in ca$e they did
move with one $ingle motion, whether it were the meer Annual,
or the $ingle Diurnal Revolution, $o it is requi$ite, that mixing
tho$e two motions together, there do re$ult thence for the parts
of the $aid Globe irregular motions, one while accelerated, and
another while retarded, by means of the additions or $ub$tracti-
ons of the Diurnal conver$ion from the annual circulation. So
that, if it be true (and mo$t true it is, as experience proves) that
the acceleration and retardation of the motion of the Ve$-
$el, makes water contained therein to run to and again the long
waves of it, and to ri$e and fall in its extreames, who will make
$cruple of granting, that the $aid effect may, nay ought to $uc-
ceed in the Sea-waters, contained within their Ve$$els, $ubject to
$uch like alterations, and e$pecially in tho$e that di$tend them-
$elves long-wayes from We$t to Ea$t, which is the cour$e that
<marg><I>The mo$t potent

the motion of tho$e $ame Ve$$els $teereth? Now this is the
mo$t potent and primary cau$e of the ebbing and flowing, with-
out the which no $uch effect would en$ue. But becau$e the par-
ticular accidents are many and various, that in $everal places and
times are ob$erved, which mu$t of nece$$ity have dependance
<foot>on</foot>
<p n=>391</p>
on other different concomitant cau$es, although they ought all
to have connexion with the primary; therefore it is convenient
that we propound and examine the $everal accidents that may
be the cau$es of $uch different effects.</P>
<P>The fir$t of which is, that when ever the water, by means of a
<marg><I>Sundry accidents
that happen in the
ebbings &amp; flowings</I></marg>
notable retardation or acceleration of the motion of the Ve$$el,
its container, $hall have acquired a cau$e of running towards this
<marg><I>The first acci-
dent.</I></marg>
or that extream, and $hall be rai$ed in the one, and abated in the
<marg><I>The Water rai-
$ed in one end of
the Ve$$el return-
eth of its $<*>f to</I>
&AElig;quilibrium.</marg>
other, it $hall not neverthele$$e continue, for any time in that
$tate, when once the primary cau$e is cea$ed: but by vertue of
its own gravity and natural inclination to level and grow, even it
$hall $peedily return backwards of its own accord, and, as being
grave and fluid, $hall not only move towards <I>&AElig;quilibrium</I>; but
being impelled by its own <I>impetus,</I> $hall go beyond it, ri$ing in
the part, where before it was lowe$t; nor $hall it $tay here, but
returning backwards anew, with more reiterated reciprocations of
its undulations, it $hall give us to know, that it will not from a
velocity of motion, once conceived, reduce it $elf, in an in$tant,
to the privation thereof, and to the $tate of re$t, but will $ucce$-
$ively, by decrea$ing a little and a little, reduce it $elf unto the
$ame, ju$t in the $ame manner as we $ee a weight hanging at a
cord, after it hath been once removed from its $tate of re$t, that
is, from its perpendicularity, of its own accord, to return thither
and $ettle it $elf, but not till $uch time as it $hall have often
pa$t to one $ide, and to the other, with its reciprocall vi-
brations.</P>
<P>The $econd accident to be ob$erved is, that the before-
<marg><I>In the $horter
Vi$$els the undula-
tions of waters are
more frequent.</I></marg>
declared reciprocations of motion come to be made and repeated
with greater or le$$er frequency, that is, under $horter or longer
times, according to the different lengths of the Ve$$els contain-
ing the waters; $o that in the $horter $paces the reciprocati-
ons are more frequent, and in the longer more rare: ju$t as in
the former example of pendent bodies, the vibrations of tho$e
that are hanged to longer cords are $een to be le$$e frequent,
than tho$e of them that hang at $horter $trings.</P>
<P>And here, for a third ob$ervation, it is to be noted, that not
<marg><I>The greater
profundity maketh
the undulations of
waters more fre-
quent.</I></marg>
onely the greater or le$$er length of the Ve$$el is a cau$e that
the water maketh its reciprocations under different times; but
the greater or le$$er profundity worketh the $ame effect. And
it happeneth, that of waters contained in receptacles of equall
length, but of unequal depth, that which $hall be the deepe$t,
maketh its undulations under $horter times, and the reciprocati-
ons of the $hallower waters are le$$e frequent.</P>
<P>Fourthly, there are two effects worthy to be noted, and di-
ligently ob$erved, which the water worketh in tho$e its vibra-
<foot>tions;</foot>
<p n=>392</p>
<marg><I>W<*> ri$eth &amp;
falleth in the ex-

tions; the one is its ri$ing and falling alternately towards the
one and other extremity; the other is its moving and running, to
$o $peak, Horizontally forwards and backwards. Which two dif-
ferent motions differently re$ide in divers parts of the Water:
for its extream parts are tho$e which mo$t eminently ri$e and fall;
tho$e in the middle never ab$olutely moving upwards and down-
wards, of the re$t $ucce$$ively tho$e that are neere$t to the ex-
treams ri$e and fall proportionally more than the remote: but on
the contrary, touching the other progre$$ive motion forwards
and backwards, the middle parts move notably, going and re-
turning, and the waters that are in the extream parts gain no
ground at all; $ave onely in ca$e that in their ri$ing they over-
flow their banks, and break forth of their fir$t channel and re-
ceptacle; but where there is the ob$tacle of banks to keep them
in, they onely ri$e and fall; which yet hindereth not the waters
in the middle from fluctuating to and again; which likewi$e
the other parts do in proportion, undulating more or le$$e,
according as they are neerer or more remote from the middle.</P>
<marg><I>An accident of
the Earths motions
impo$$ible to be re-
duced to practice
by art.</I></marg>
<P>The fifth particular accident ought the more attentively to be
con$idered, in that it is impo$$ible to repre$ent the effect there-
of by an experiment or example; and the accident is this. In
the ve$$els by us framed with art, and moved, as the above-
named Bark, one while more, and another while le$$e $wiftly,
the acceleration and retardation is imparted in the $ame manner
to all the ve$$el, and to every part of it; $o that whil$t <I>v. g.</I> the
Bark forbeareth to move, the parts precedent retard no more
than the $ub$equent, but all equally partake of the $ame re-
tardment; and the $elf-$ame holds true of the acceleration,
namely, that conferring on the Bark a new cau$e of grea-
ter velocity, the Prow and Poop both accelerate in one and
the $ame manner. But in huge great ve$$els, $uch as are the very
long bottomes of Seas, albeit they al$o are no other than cer-
tain cavities made in the $olidity of the Terre$trial Globe,
it alwayes admirably happeneth, that their extreams do not
unitedly equall, and at the $ame moments of time increa$e
and dimini$h their motion, but it happeneth that when one of its
extreames hath, by vertue of the commixtion of the two
Motions, Diurnal, and Annual, greatly retarded its velocity,
the other extream is animated with an extream $wift motion.
Which for the better under$tanding of it we will explain, rea$-
$uming a Scheme like to the former; in which if we do but $up-
po$e a tract of Sea to be long, <I>v. g.</I> a fourth part, as is the arch
B C [<I>in Fig.</I> 2.] becau$e the parts B are, as hath been already
declared, very $wift in motion, by rea$on of the union of the
two motions diurnal and annual, towards one and the $ame way,
<foot>but</foot>
<p n=>393</p>
but the part C at the $ame time is retarded in its motion, as be
ing deprived of the progre$$ion dependant on the diurnal motion:
If we $uppo$e, I $ay, a tract of Sea as long as the arch B C, we
have already $een, that its extreams $hall move in the $ame time
with great inequality. And extreamly different would the velo-
cities of a tract of Sea be that is in length a $emicircle, and pla-
ced in the po$ition B C D, in regard that the extream B would
be in a mo$t accelerate motion, and the other D, in a mo$t $low
one; and the intermediate parts towards C, would be in a
moderate motion. And according as the $aid tracts of Sea $hall
be $horter, they $hall le$$e participate of this extravagant acci-
dent, of being in $ome hours of the day with their parts diver$ly
affected by velocity and tardity of motion. So that, if, as in the fir$t
ca$e, we $ee by experience that the acceleration and retardation,
though equally imparted to all the parts of the conteining Ve$$el,
is the cau$e that the water contained, fluctuates too and again, what
may we think would happen in a Ve$$el $o admirably di$po$ed,
that retardation and acceleration of motion is very unequally
contributed to its parts? Certainly we mu$t needs grant that
greater and more wonderful cau$es of the commotions in the
Water ought to be looked for. And though it may $eem im-
po$$ible to $ome, that in artificial Machines and Ve$$els we $hould
be able to experiment the effects of $uch an accident; yet ne-
verthele$$e it is not ab$olutely impo$$ible to be done; and I have
by me the model of an Engine, in which the effect of the$e admi-
rable commixtions of motions may be particularly ob$erved. But
as to what concerns our pre$ent purpo$e, that which you may
have hitherto comprehended with your imagination may $uf-
fice.</P>
<P>SAGR. I for my own particular very well conceive that this
admirable accident ought nece$$arily to evene in the Straights of
Seas, and e$pecially in tho$e that di$tend them$elves for a great
length from We$t to Ea$t; namely according to the cour$e of
the motions of the Terre$trial Globe; and as it is in a certain
manner unthought of, and without a pre$ident among the moti-
ons po$$ible to be made by us, $o it is not hard for me to believe,
that effects may be derived from the $ame, which are not to be i-
mitated by our artificial experiments.</P>
<P>SALV. The$e things being declared, it is time that we pro-
ceed to examine the particular accidents, which, together with
their diver$ities, are ob$erved by experience in the ebbing and
flowing of the waters. And fir$t we need not think it hard to
<marg><I>Rea$ons renew-
ed of the particu-
lar accidents ob-
$erved in the eb-
bings and flowings.</I></marg>
gue$$e whence it happeneth, that in Lakes, Pooles, and al$o in the
le$$er Seas there is no notable flux and reflux; the which hath
two very $olid rea$ons. The one is, that by rea$on of the $hort-
<foot>Ddd ne$$e</foot>
<p n=>394</p>
<marg><I>Second cau$es
why in $mall Seas
and in Lakes there
are no ebbings and
flowings.</I></marg>
ne$$e of the Ve$$el, in its acquiring in $everal hours of the day
$everal degrees of velocity, they are with very little difference
acquired by all its parts; for as well the precedent as the $ub$e-
quent, that is to $ay, both the Ea$tern and We$tern parts, do
accelerate and retard almo$t in the $ame manner; and withal
making that alteration by little and little, and not by giving the
motion of the conteining Ve$$el a $udden check, and retard-
ment, or a $udden and great impul$e or acceleration; both it
and all its parts, come to be gently and equally impre$$ed with
the $ame degrees of velocity; from which uniformity it follow-
eth, that al$o the conteined water with but $mall re$i$tance and
oppo$ition, receiveth the $ame impre$$ions, and by con$equence
doth give but very ob$cure $ignes of its ri$ing or falling, or of its
running towards one part or another. The which effect is likewi$e
manife$tly to be $een in the little artificial Ve$$els, wherein the
contained water doth receive the $elf $ame impre$$ions of veloci-
ty; when ever the acceleration and retardation is made by gentle
and uniform proportion. But in the Straights and Bays that for a
great length di$tend them$elves from Ea$t to We$t, the accele-
ration and retardation is more notable and more uneven, for
that one of its extreams $hall be much retarded in motion, and
the other $hall at the $ame time move very $wiftly: The reci-
procal libration or levelling of the water proceeding from the <I>im-
petus</I> that it had conceived from the motion of its container.
The which libration, as hath been noted, hath its undulations
very frequent in $mall Ve$$els; from whence en$ues, that though
there do re$ide in the Terre$trial motions the cau$e of confer-
ring on the waters a motion onely from twelve hours to twelve
hours, for that the motion of the conteining Ve$$els do ex-
treamly accelerate and extreamly retard but once every day,
and no more; yet neverthele$$e this $ame $econd cau$e depend-
ing on the gravity of the water which $triveth to reduce it $elf to
equilibration, and that according to the $hortne$$e of the Ve$-
$el hath its reciprocations of one, two, three, or more hours, this
intermixing with the fir$t, which al$o it $elf in $mall Ve$$els is
very little, it becommeth upon the whole altogether in$en$ible.
For the primary cau$e, which hath the periods of twelve hours,
having not made an end of imprinting the precedent commoti-
on, it is overtaken and oppo$ed by the other $econd, depen-
dant on the waters own weight, which according to the brevity
and profundity of the Ve$$el, hath the time of its undulations of
one, two, three, four, or more hours; and this contending
with the other former one, di$turbeth and removeth it, not per-
mitting it to come to the height, no nor to the half of its moti-
on; and by this conte$tation the evidence of the ebbing and
<foot>flow-</foot>
<p n=>395</p>
flowing is wholly annihilated, or at lea$t very much ob$cured.
I pa$$e by the continual alteration of the air, which di$quieting
the water, permits us not to come to a certainty, whether any,
though but $mall, encrea$e or abatement of half an inch, or
le$$e, do re$ide in the Straights, or receptacles of water not a-
bove a degree or two in length.</P>
<P>I come in the $econd place to re$olve the que$tion, why, there
<marg><I>The rea$on gi-
ven, why the eb-
bings and flowings,
for the mo$t part,
are every $ix
hours.</I></marg>
not re$iding any vertue in the primary principle of commoving
the waters, $ave onely every twelve hours, that is to $ay, once
by the greate$t velocity, and once by the greate$t tardity of
motion; the ebbings and flowings $hould yet neverthele$$e ap-
pear to be every $ix hours. To which is an$wered, that this de-
termination cannot any wayes be taken from the primary cau$e
onely; but there is a nece$$ity of introducing the $econdary cau-
$es, as namely the greater or le$$e length of the Ve$$els, and
the greater or le$$e depth of the waters in them conteined.
Which cau$es although they have not any operation in the moti-
ons of the waters, tho$e operations belonging to the $ole prima-
ry cau$e, without which no ebbing or flowing would happen,
yet neverthele$$e they have a principal $hare in determining the
times or periods of the reciprocations, and herein their influ-
ence is $o powerful, that the primary cau$e mu$t of force give
way unto them. The period of $ix hours therefore is no more
proper or natural than tho$e of other intervals of times, though
indeed its the mo$t ob$erved, as agreeing with our Mediterrane,
which was the onely Sea that for many Ages was navigated:
though neither is that period ob$erved in all its parts; for
that in $ome more angu$t places, $uch as are the <I>Helle-
$pont,</I> and the <I>&AElig;gean</I> Sea, the periods are much $horter,
and al$o very divers among$t them$elves; for which diver-
$ities, and their cau$es incomprehen$ible to <I>Ari$totle,</I> $ome
$ay, that after he had a long time ob$erved it upon $ome
cliffes of <I>Negropont,</I> being brought to de$peration, he threw
him$elf into the adjoyning <I>Euripus,</I> and voluntarily drowned
him$elf.</P>
<P>In the third place we have the rea$on ready at hand, whence
<marg><I>The cau$e why
$ome Seas, though
very long, $uffer
no ebbing and
flowing.</I></marg>
it commeth to pa$$e, that $ome Seas, although very long, as is
the Red Sea, are almo$t altogether exempt from Tides, which
happeneth becau$e their length extendeth not from Ea$t to
We$t, but rather tran$ver$ly from the Southea$t to the North-
we$t; but the motions of the Earth going from We$t to Ea$t;
the impul$es of the water, by that means, alwayes happen to fall
in the Meridians, and do not move from parallel to parallel;
in$omuch that in the Seas that extend them$elves athwart to-
wards the Poles, and that the contrary way are narrow, there is
<foot>Ddd 2 no</foot>
<p n=>396</p>
no cau$e of ebbing and flowing, $ave onely by the participation
of another Sea, wherewith it hath communication, that is $ub-
ject to great commotions.</P>
<marg><I>Ebbings and
flowings why grea-
te$t in the extre-
mities of gulphs,
and lea$t in the
middle parts.</I></marg>
<P>In the fourth place we $hall very ea$ily find out the rea$on
why the fluxes and refluxes are greate$t, as to the waters ri$ing
and falling in the utmo$t extremities of Gulphs, and lea$t in the
intermediate parts; as daily experience $heweth here in <I>Venice,</I>
lying in the farther end of the <I>Adriatick</I> Sea, where that diffe-
rence commonly amounts to five or $ix feet; but in the places
of the Mediterrane, far di$tant from the extreams, that mutati-
on is very $mall, as in the I$les of <I>Cor$ica</I> and <I>Sardinnia,</I> and
in the Strands of <I>Rome</I> and <I>Ligorne,</I> where it exceeds not half a
foot; we $hall under$tand al$o, why on the contrary, where
the ri$ings and fallings are $mall, the cour$es and recour$es are
great: I $ay it is an ea$ie thing to under$tand the cau$es of the$e
accidents, $eeing that we meet with many manife$t occurrences
of the $ame nature in every kind of Ve$$el by us artificially com-
po$ed, in which the $ame effects are ob$erved naturally to fol-
low upon our moving it unevenly, that is, one while fa$ter, and
another while $lower.</P>
<marg><I>Why in narrow
places the cour$e
of the waters is
more $wift than in
larger.</I></marg>
<P>Moreover, con$idering in the fifth place, that the $ame
quantity of Water being moved, though but gently, in a $patious
Channel, comming afterwards to go through a narrow pa$$age,
will of nece$$ity run, with great violence, we $hall not finde it hard
to comprehend the cau$e of the great Currents that are made
in the narrow Channel that $eparateth <I>Calabria</I> from <I>Sicilia:</I>
for that all the Water that, by the $paciou$ne$$e of the I$le,
and by the <I>Ionick</I> Gulph, happens to be pent in the Ea$tern
part of the Sea, though it do in that, by rea$on of its largene$s,
gently de$cend towards the We$t, yet neverthele$$e, in that it
is pent up in the <I>Bo$phorus,</I> it floweth with great violence be-
tween <I>Scilla</I> and <I>Caribdis,</I> and maketh a great agitation. Like to
which, and much greater, is $aid to be betwixt <I>Africa</I> and the
great I$le of St. <I>Lorenzo,</I> where the Waters of the two va$t
Seas, <I>Indian</I> and <I>Ethiopick,</I> that lie round it, mu$t needs be
$traightned into a le$$e Channel between the $aid I$le and the
<I>Ethiopian</I> Coa$t. And the Currents mu$t needs be very great
in the Straights of <I>Magellanes,</I> which joyne together the
va$t Oceans of <I>Ethiopia,</I> and <I>Del Zur,</I> called al$o the <I>Pacifick</I>
Sea.</P>
<marg><I>A di$cu$$ion of
$ome more ab$tru$e
accidents ob$erved
in the ebbing and
flowing.</I></marg>
<P>It follows now, in the $ixth place, that to render a rea$on of
$ome more ab$tru$e and incredible accidents, which are ob$er-
ved upon this occa$ion, we make a con$iderable reflection upon
the two principal cau$es of ebbings and flowings, afterwards
compounding and mixing them together. The fir$t and $imple$t
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>397</p>
of which is (as hath often been $aid) the determinate accelera-
tion and retardation of the parts of the Earth, from whence
the Waters have a determinate period put to their decur$ions
towards the Ea$t, and return towards the We$t, in the time of
twenty $our hours. The other is that which dependeth on the pro-
per gravity of the Water, which being once commoved by the
primary cau$e, $eeketh, in the next place, to reduce it $elf to <I>&AElig;-
quilibrium,</I> with iterated reciprocations; which are not deter-
mined by one $ole and prefixed time; but have as many varie-
ties of times as are the different lengths and profundities of the
receptacles, and Straights of Seas; and by what dependeth on
this $econd principle, they would ebbe. and flow, $ome in one
hour, others in two, in four, in $ix, in eight, in ten, &amp;c. Now if
we begin to put together the fir$t cau$e, which hath its $et Period
from twelve hours to twelve hours, with $ome one of the $econ-
dary, that hath its Period <I>verb. grat.</I> from five hours to five
hours, it would come to pa$$e, that at $ometimes the primary
cau$e and $econdary would accord to make impul$es both one
and the $ame way; and in this concurrency, and (as one may call
it) unanimous con$piration the flowings $hall be great. At other
times it happening that the primary impul$e doth, in a certain
manner, oppo$e that which the $econdary Period would make,
and in this conte$t one of the Principles being taken away, that
which the other would give, will weaken the commotion of the
Waters, and the Sea will return to a very tranquil State, and
almo$t immoveable. And at other times, according as the two
afore$aid Principles $hall neither altogether conte$t, nor altoge-
ther concur, there $hall be other kinds of alterations made in
the increa$e and diminution of the ebbing and flowing. It may
likewi$e fall out that two Seas, con$iderably great and which
communicate by $ome narrow Channel, may chance to have, by
rea$on of the mixtion of the two Principles of motion, one
cau$e to flow at the time that the other hath cau$e to move a
contrary way; in which ca$e in the Channel, whereby they di$-
imbogue them$elves into each other, there do extraordinary
conturbations in$ue, with oppo$ite and vortick motions, and
mo$t dangerous boilings and breakings, as frequent relations
and experiences do a$$ure us. From $uch like di$cordant moti-
ons, dependent not onely on the differenr po$itions and longi-
tudes, but very much al$o upon the different profundities of the
Seas, which have the $aid intercour$e there do happen at $ome-
times different commotions in the Waters, irregular, and that
can be reduced to no rules of ob$ervation, the rea$ons of which
have much troubled, and alwayes do trouble Mariners, for that
they meet with them without $eeing either impul$e of winds, or
<foot>other</foot>

other eminent aereal alteration that might occa$ion the $ame; of
which di$turbance of the Air we ought to make great account
in other accidents, and to take it for a third and accidental
cau$e, able to alter very much the ob$ervation of the effects de-
pending on the $econdary and more e$$ential cau$es. And it is
not to be doubted, but that impetuous windes, continuing to
blow, for example, from the Ea$t, they $hall retein the Waters
and prohibit the reflux or ebbing; whereupon the $econd and
third reply of the flux or tide overtaking the former, at the
hours prefixed, they will $well very high; and being thus born
up for $ome dayes, by the $trength of the Winds, they $hall ri$e
more than u$ual, making extraordinary inundations.</P>
<P>We ought al$o, (and this $hall $erve for a $eventh Probleme)
to take notice of another cau$e of motion dependant on the
great abundance of the Waters of great Rivers that di$charge
<marg><I>The cau$e why,
in $ome narrow
Channels, we $ee

alwayes one way.</I></marg>
them$elves into Seas of no great capacity, whereupon in the
Straits or <I>Bo$phori</I> that communicate with tho$e Seas, the Waters
are $een to run always one way: as it happeneth in the <I>Thraci-
an Bo$phorus</I> below <I>Con$tantinople,</I> where the water alwayes
runneth from the <I>Black-Sea,</I> towards the <I>Propontis</I>: For in the
$aid <I>Black-Sea</I> by rea$on of its $hortne$$e, the principal cau$es
of ebbing and flowing are but of $mall force. But, on the con-
trary, very great Rivers falling into the $ame, tho$e huge de-
fluxions of water being to pa$$e and di$gorge them$elves by the
<marg>* Or current.</marg>
the Straight, the ^{*}cour$e is there very notable and alwayes to-
wards the South. Where moreover we ought to take notice, that
the $aid Straight or Channel, albeit very narrow, is not $ubject
to perturbations, as the Straight of <I>Soilla</I> and <I>Carybdis</I>; for that
that hath the <I>Black-Sea</I> above towards the North, and the <I>Pro-
pontis,</I> the <I>&AElig;gean,</I> and the <I>Mediterranean</I> Seas joyned unto it,
though by a long tract towards the South; but now, as we have
ob$erved, the Seas, though of never $o great length, lying North
and South, are not much $ubject to ebbings and flowings; but
becau$e the <I>Sicilian</I> Straight is $ituate between the parts of the
Mediterrane di$tended for a long tract or di$tance from We$t to
Ea$t, that is, according to the cour$e of the fluxes and refluxes,
therefore in this the agitations are very great; and would be
much more violent between <I>Hercules Pillars,</I> in ca$e the
Straight of <I>Gibraltar</I> did open le$$e; and tho$e of the Straight of
<I>Magellanes</I> are reported to be extraordinary violent.</P>
<P>This is what, for the pre$ent, cometh into my mind to $ay unto
you about the cau$es of this fir$t period diurnal of the Tide, and
its various accidents, touching which, if you have any thing to
offer, you may let us hear it, that $o we may afterwards pro-
ceed to the other two periods, monethly and annual.</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>399</p>
<P>SIMP. In my opinion, it cannot be denied, but that your di$-
cour$e carrieth with it much of probability, arguing, as we $ay,
<I>ex $uppo$itione,</I> namely, granting that the Earth moveth with
the two motions a$$igned it by <I>Copernicus</I>: but if that motion
<marg><I>The Hypothe$ir
of the Earths mo-
bility taken in fa-
vour of the Tide,
oppo$ed.</I></marg>
be di$proved, all that you have $aid is vain, and in$ignificant:
and for the di$proval of that <I>Hypothe$is,</I> it is very manife$tly
hinted by your Di$cour$e it $elf. You, with the $uppo$ition of
the two Terre$trial motions, give a rea$on of the ebbing and
flowing; and then again, arguing circularly, from the ebbing
and flowing, draw the rea$on and confirmation of tho$e very
motions; aud $o proceeding to a more $pecious Di$cour$e, you
$ay that the Water, as being a fluid body, and not tenaciou$ly
annexed to the Earth, is not con$trained punctually to obey eve-
ry of its motions, from which you afterwards infer its ebbing
and flowing, Now I, according to your own method, argue
the quite contrary, and $ay; the Air is much more tenuous, and
fluid than the Water, and le$$e annexed to the Earths $uperfici-
es, to which the Water, if it be for nothing el$e, yet by rea$on
of its gravity that pre$$eth down upon the $ame more than the
light Air, adhereth; therefore the Air is much obliged to fol-
low the motions of the Earth: and therefore were it $o, that the
Earth did move in that manner, we the inhabitants of it, and
carried round with like velocity by it, ought perpetually to feel
a Winde from the Ea$t that beateth upon us with intolerable
force. And that $o it ought to fall out, quotidian experience a$-
$ureth us: for if with onely riding po$t, at the $peed of eight or
ten miles an hour in the tranquil Air, the incountering of it with
our face $eemeth to us a Winde that doth not lightly blow upon
us, what $hould we expect from our rapid cour$e of 800. or a
thou$and miles an hour, again$t the Air, that is, free from that
motion? And yet, notwith$tanding we cannot perceive any
thing of that nature.</P>
<P>SALV. To this objection that hath much of likelihood in it, I
<marg><I>The an$wer to
the objections
made again$t the
motion of the Ter-
re$trial Globe.</I></marg>
reply, that its true, the Air is of greater tenuity and levity; and,
by rea$on of its levity, le$$e adherent to the Earth than Water $o
much more grave and ^{*}bulky; but yet the con$equence is fal$e
that you infer from the$e qualities; namely, that upon account
<marg>+ Corpulenta.</marg>
of that its levity, tenuity, and le$$e adherence to the Earth, it
$hould be more exempt than the Water from following the
Terre$trial Motions; $o as that to us, who ab$olutely pertake of
of them, the $aid exemption $hould be $en$ible and manife$t;
nay, it happeneth quite contrary; for, if you well remember, the
cau$e of the ebbing and flowing of the Water a$$igned by us,
con$i$teth in the Waters not following the unevenne$$e of the
motion of its Ve$$el, but retaining the <I>impetus</I> conceived before,
<foot>without</foot>
<p n=>400</p>
without dimini$hing or increa$ing it according to the preci$e rate
of its dimini$hing or increa$ing in its Ve$$el. Becau$e therefore
<marg><I>The Water more
apt to con$erve an</I>
impetus <I>conceived,
then the Air.</I></marg>
that in the con$ervation and retention of the <I>impetus</I> before con-
ceived, the di$obedience to a new augmentation or diminution of
motion con$i$teth, that moveable that $hall be mo$t apt for $uch
a retention, $hall be al$o mo$t commodious to demon$trate the
effect that followeth in con$equence of that retention. Now how
much the Water is di$po$ed to maintain $uch a conceived agita-
tion; though the cau$es cea$e that impre$s the $ame, the experi-
ence of the Seas extreamly di$turbed by impetuous Winds $hew-
eth us; the Billows of which, though the Air be grown calm, and
the Wind laid, for a long time after continue in motion: As the
Sacred Poet plea$antly $ings,</P>
<head><I>Qual l'alto Egeo,</I> &amp;c.----------</head>
<P>And that long continuing rough after a $torm, dependeth on
<marg><I>Light bodies ea$ier
to be moved than
beavy, but le$s aut
to con$erve the mo-
tion.</I></marg>
the gravity of the water: For, as I have el$ewhere $aid, light bo-
dies are much ea$ier to be moved than the more grave, but yet
are $o much the le$s apt to con$erve the motion imparted, when
once the moving cau$e cea$eth. Whence it comes that the Aire,
as being of it $elf very light and thin, is ea$ily mov'd by any very
$mall force, yet it is withall very unable to hold on its motion,
the Mover once cea$ing. Therefore, as to the Aire which envi-
rons the Terre$trial Globe, I would fay, that by rea$on of its
adherence, it is no le$$e carried about therewith then the Water;
and e$pecially that part which is contained in its ve$$els; which
<marg><I>Its more rational
that the Air be
commoved by the
rugged $urface of
the <*>ar h than
b<*> the Cele$tial
motion.</I></marg>
ve$$els are the valleys enclo$ed with Mountains. And we may
with much more rea$on affirm that this $ame part of the Air is
carried round, and born forwards by the rugged parts of the
Earth, than that the higher is whi<*>'d about by the motion of the
Heavens, as ye <I>Peripateticks</I> maintain.</P>
<P>What hath been hitherto $poken, $eems to me a $ufficient an-
<marg><I>The revolution of
the Earth con-
f<*>med by a new
argument taken
from the Air.</I></marg>
$wer to the allega ion of <I>Simputius</I>; yet neverthele$s with a new
in$tance and $olution, founded upon an admirable experiment, I
will $uperabundantly $atisfie him, and confirm to <I>Sagredus</I> the
mobility of the Earth. I have told you that the Air, and in par-
ticular that part of it which a$cendeth not above the tops of the
highe$t Mountains, is carried round by the uneven parts of the
Earths $urface: from whence it $hould $eem, that it mu$t of con-
$equence come to pa$$e, that in ca$e the $uperficies of the Earth
were not uneven, but $mooth and plain, no cau$e would remain
for drawing the Air along with it, or at lea$t for revolving it with
$o much uniformity. Now the $urface of this our Globe, is not
all craggy and rugged, but there are exceeding great tracts very
<foot>even,</foot>
<p n=>401</p>
even, to wit, the $urfaces of very va$t Seas, which being al$o far
remote from the continuate ledges of Mountains which environ
it, $eem to have no faculty of carrying the $uper-ambient Air
along therewith: and not carrying it about, we may perceive what
will of con$equence en$ue in tho$e places.</P>
<P>SIMP. I was about to propo$e the very $ame difficulty, which
I think is of great validity.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ay very well <I>Simplicius,</I> for from the not finding
in the Air that which of con$equence would follow, did this our
Globe move round; you argue its immoveablene$$e. But in ca$e
that this which you think ought of nece$$ary con$equence to be
found, be indeed by experience proved to be $o; will you accept
it for a $ufficient te$timony and an argument for the mobility of
the $aid Globe?</P>
<P>SIMP. In this ca$e it is not requi$ite to argue with me alone,
for if it $hould $o fall out, and that I could not comprehend the
cau$e thereof, yet haply it might be known by others.</P>
<P>SALV. So that by playing with you, a man $hall never get, but
be alwayes on the lo$ing hand; and therefore it would be better
to give over: Neverthele$s, that we may not cheat our third man
we will play on. We $aid even now, and with $ome addition we
reitterate it, that the Ayr as if it were a thin and fluid body, and
not $olidly conjoyned with the Earth, $eem'd not to be nece$$i-
tated to obey its motion; unle$$e $o far as the craggine$s of the
terre$trial $uperficies, tran$ports and carries with it a part there-
of contigious thereunto; which doth not by any great $pace ex-
ceed the greate$t altitude of Mountains: the which portion of Air
ought to be $o much le$s repugnant to the terre$trial conver$ion,
<marg><I>The vaporous
parts of the earth,
partake of its mo-
tions.</I></marg>
by how much it is repleat with vapours, fumes, and exhalations,
matters all participating of terrene qualities, and con$equently
apt of their own nature to the $ame motions. But where there are
wanting the cau$es of motion, that is, where the $urface of the
Globe hath great levels, and where there is le$s mixture of the
terrene vapours, there the cau$e whereby the ambient Air is con-
$trained to give entire obedience to the terre$trial conver$ion will
cea$e in part; $o that in $uch places, whil$t the Earth revolveth to-
wards the Ea$t, there will be continually a wind perceived which
will beat upon us, blowing from the Ea$t towards the We$t:
and $uch gales will be the more $en$ible, where the revolution of
the Globe is mo$t $wift; which will be in places more remote from
the Poles, and approaching to the greate$t Circle of the diurnal
conver$ion. But now <I>de facto</I> experience much confi meth this
Phylo$ophical argumentation; for in the $patious Seas, and in their
parts mo$t remote from Land, and $ituate under the Torrid Zone,
that is bounded by the Tropicks, where there are none of tho$e
<foot>Eee $ame</foot>
<p n=>402</p>

to them are We$t. Whereas on the contrary the Cour$e from
thence towards the Ea$t is difficult and uncertain, and not to be
made by the $ame Rhumb, but mu$t vere more to Land-ward, to
recover other Winds, which we may call accidentary and tumul-
tuary, produced from other Principles, as tho$e that inhabit the
continent find by experience. Of which productions of Winds,
the Cau$es are many and different, which $hall not at this time be

mentioned. And the$e accidentary Winds are tho$e which blow
indifferently from all parts of the Eatth, and make rough the Seas
remote from the Equinoctial, and environed by the rugged Sur-
face of the Earth; which is as much as to $ay environ'd with
tho$e perturbations of Air, that confound that primary Gale.
The which, in ca$e the$e accidental impediments were removed,
would be continually felt, and e$pecially upon the Sea. Now
$ee how the effect of the Water and Air $eem wonderfully to ac-
cord with the Cele$tial ob$ervations, to confirm the mobility of
our Terre$trial Globe.</P>
<marg><I>Another ob$erva-

<P>SAGR. I al$o for a final clo$e will relate to you one particular,
which as I believe is unknown unto you, and which likewi$e may
$erve to confirm the $ame conclu$ion: You <I>Salviatus</I> alledged,
That Accident which Sailers meet with between the Tropicks;
I mean that perpetual Gale of Winde that beats upon them from
the Ea$t, of which I have an account from tho$e that have many
times made the Voyage: And moreover (which is very ob$er-
vable) I under$tand that the Mariners do not call it a <I>Wind,</I> but
<marg>Which Wind
with our Engli$h
Mariners is called
the <I>Trade-wind.</I></marg>
by another ^{*} name, which I do not now remember, taken haply
from its $o fixed and con$tant Tenor; which when they have met
with, they tie up their $hrouds and other cordage belonging to
the Sails, and without any more need of touching them, though
they be in a $leep, they can continue their cour$e. Now this con$tant
Trade-wind was known to be $uch by its continual blowing with-
out interruptions; for if it were interrupted by other Windes, it
would not have been acknowledged for a $ingular Effect, and
different from the re$t: from which I wlll infer, That it may be
that al$o our Mediterranean Sea doth partake of the like accident;
but it is not ob$erved, as being frequently altered by the conflu-
ence of other windes. And this I $ay, not without good grounds,
yea upon very probable conjectures whch came unto my know-
ledge, from that which tendred it $elf to my notice on occa$ion of
the voyage that I made into <I>Syria,</I> going Con$ul for this Nation
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>403</p>
to <I>Aleppo,</I> and this it is: That keeping a particular account and

memorial of the dayes of the departure and arrival of the Ships in
the Ports of <I>Alexandria,</I> of <I>Alexandretta,</I> and this of <I>Venice</I>; in
comparing $undry of them, which I did for my curio$ity, I found
that in exactne$s of account the returns hither, that is the voiages
from Ea$t to We$t along the Mediterrane, are made in le$s time
then the contrary cour$es by 25. in the Hundred: So that we $ee
that one with another, the Ea$tern windes are $tronger then the
We$tern.</P>
<P>SALV. I am very glad I know this particular, which doth not
a little make for the confirmation of the Earths mobility. And
although it may be alledged, That all the Water of the Mediter-
rane runs perpetually towards the Straits-mouth, as being to
di$imbogue into the Ocean, the waters of as many Rivers, as do
di$charge them$elves into the $ame; I do not think that that cur-
rent can be $o great, as to be able of it $elf alone to make $o no-
table a difference: which is al$o manife$t by ob$erving that the
water in the Pharo of <I>Sicily</I> runneth back again no le$s towards
the Ea$t, than it runneth forwards towards the We$t.</P>
<P>SAGR. I, that have not as <I>Simplicius,</I> an inclination to $ati$-
fie any one be$ides my $elf, am $atisfied with what hath been $aid
as to this fir$t particular: Therefore <I>Salviatus,</I> when you think
it fit to proceed forward, I am prepared to hear you.</P>
<P>SALV. I $hall do as you command me, but yet I would fain
hear the opinion al$o of <I>Simplicius,</I> from who$e judgement I can
argue how much I may promi$e to my $elf touching the$e di$-
cour$es from the <I>Peripatetick</I> Schools, if ever they $hould come
to their ears.</P>
<P>SIMP. I de$ire not that my opinion $hould $erve or $tand for
a mea$ure, whereby you $hould judge of others thoughts; for
as I have often $aid, I am incon$iderable in the$e kinde of $tudies,
and $uch things may come into the mindes of tho$e that are enter-
ed into the deepe$t pa$$ages of Philo$ophy, as I could never think
of; as having (according to the Proverb) $carce ki$t her Maid:
yet neverthele$s, to give you my $udden thoughts, I $hall tell
you, That of tho$e effects by you recounted, and particularly the
la$t, there may in my judgement very $ufficient Rea$ons be given
without the Earths mobility, by the mobility of the Heavens one-
ly; never introducing any novelty more, than the inver$ion of
that which you your $elf propo$e unto us. It hath been received
<marg><I>It is demon$tra-
ted inverting the
argument, that
the perpetual mo-
tion of the Air
from Ea$t to We$t
cometh from the
motion of Heaven?</I></marg>
by the <I>Peripatetick</I> Schools, that the Element of Fire, and al$o a
great part of the Aire is carried about according to the Diurnal
conver$ion from Ea$t to We$t, by the contact of the Concave of
the Lunar Orb, as by the Ve$$el their container. Now without
going out of your track, I will that we determine the Quantity of
<foot>Eee 2 the</foot>
<p n=>404</p>
<marg><I>It is demon$trated
inverting the ar-
gument, that the
perpetual motion of
the Air from Ea$t
to We$t, cometh
from the motion of
Heaven.</I></marg>
the Aire which partaketh of that motion to di$tend $o low as to
the Tops of the highe$t Hills, and that likewi$e they would reach
to the Earth, if tho$e Mountains did not impede them, which
agreeth with what you $ay: For as you affirm, the Air, which is
invironed by ledges of Mountains, to be carried about by the
a$perity of the moveable Earth; we on the contrary $ay, That
the whole Element of Air is carried about by the motion of
Heaven, that part only excepted which lyeth below tho$e bodies,
which is hindred by the a$perity of the immoveable Earth. And
whereas you $aid, That in ca$e that a$perity $hould be removed,
the Air would al$o cea$e to be whirld about; we may $ay,
That the $aid a$perity being removed, the whole Aire would con-
tinue its motion. Whereupon, becau$e the $urfaces of $pacious
Seas are $mooth, and even; the Airs motion $hall continue upon
tho$e, alwaies blowing from the Ea$t: And this is more $en$ibly
perceived in Climates lying under the Line, and within the Tro-
picks, where the motion of Heaven is $wifter; and like as that
Cele$tial motion is able to bear before it all the Air that is at
liberty, $o we may very rationally affirm that it contributeth the
$ame motion to the Water moveable, as being fluid and not con-
nected to the immobility of the Earth: And with $o much the
<marg><I>The motion of the
Water dependeth
on the motion of
Heaven.</I></marg>
more confidence may we affirm the $ame, in that by your con-
fe$$ion, that motion ought to be very $mall in re$ect of the efficient
Cau$e; which begirting in a natural day the whole Terre$trial
Globe, pa$$eth many hundreds of miles an hour, and e$pecially
towards the Equinoctial; whereas in the currents of the open Sea,
it moveth but very few miles an hour. And thus the voiages to-
wards the We$t $hall come to be commodious and expeditious,
not onely by rea$on of the perpetual Ea$tern Gale, but of the
cour$e al$o of the Waters; from which cour$e al$o perhaps the
Ebbing and Flowing may come, by rea$on of the different $citu-
<marg><I>The flux and reo
flux may d<*>d
on the diurual mo-
tion of Heaven.</I></marg>
ation of the Terre$trial Shores: again$t which the Water coming
to beat, may al$o return backwards with a contrary motion, like
as experience $heweth us in the cour$e of Rivers; for according as
the Water in the unevenne$s of the Banks, meeteth with $ome
parts that $tand out, or make with their Meanders $ome Reach or
Bay, here the Water turneth again, and is $een to retreat back
a con$iderable $pace. Upon this I hold, That of tho$e effects
from which you argue the Earths mobility, and alledge it as a
cau$e of them, there may be a$$igned a cau$e $ufficiently valid,
retaining the Earth $tedfa$t, and re$toring the mobility of
Heaven.</P>
<P>SALV. It cannot be denied, but that your di$cour$e is ingenious,
&amp; hath much of probability, I mean probability in appearance, but
not in reality &amp; exi$tence: It con$i$teth of two parts: In the fir$t it
<foot>a$$ignes</foot>
<p n=>405</p>
a$$ignes a rea$on of the continual motion of the Ea$tern Winde,
and al$o of a like motion in the Water. In the $econd, It would
draw from the $ame Sour$e the cau$e of the Ebbing and Flowing.
The fir$t part hath (as I have $aid) $ome appearance of probabi-
lity, but yet extreamly le$s then that which we take from the
Terre$trial motion. The $econd is not onely wholly improbable,
but altogether impo$$ible and fal$e. And coming to the fir$t,
<marg><I>A rea$on of the
continual motion of
the Air and Wa-
ter may be given,
making the Earth
moveable, then by
making it immove-
able.</I></marg>
whereas it is $aid that the Concave of the Moon carrieth about
the element of Fire, and the whole Air, even to the tops of the
higher Mountains. I an$wer fir$t, that it is dubious whether
there be any element of Fire: But $uppo$e there be, it is much
doubted of the Orbe of the Moon, as al$o of all the re$t; that is,
Whether there be any $uch $olid bodies and va$t, or el$s, Whether
beyond the Air there be extended a continuate expan$ion of a
$ub$tance of much more tenuity and purity than our Air, up and
down which the Planets go wandring, as now at la$t a good part
of tho$e very Phylo$ophers begin to think: But be it in this or in
<marg><I>Its improbable that
the element of Fire
$hould be carried
round by the Con-
cave of the Moon.</I></marg>
that manner, there is no rea$on for which the Fire, by a $imple
contract to a $uperficies, which you your $elf grant to be $mooth
and ter$e, $hould be according to its whole depth carried round in
a motion different from its natural inclination; as hath been de-
fu$ely proved, and with $en$ible rea$ons demon$trated by^{+} <I>Il Sag-</I>
<marg>+ A Treati$e of our
Author formerly
cited.</marg>
<I>giatore</I>: Be$ides the other improbability of the $aid motions
transfu$ing it $elf from the $ubtile$t Fire throughout the Air, much
more den$e; and from that al$o again to the Water. But that
a body of rugged and mountainous $urface, by revolving in it
$elf, $hould carry with it the Air contiguous to it, and again$t
which its promontaries beat, is not onely probable but nece$$ary,
and experience thereof may be daily $een; though without $ee-
ing it, I believe that there is no judgement that doubts thereof.
As to the other part, $uppo$ing that the motion of Heaven did
carry round the Air, and al$o the Water; yet would that motion
for all that have nothing to do with the Ebbing and Flowing.
For being that from one onely and uniform cau$e, there can fol-
<marg><I>The Ebbing and
Flowing cannot de-
pend on the motion
of Heaven.</I></marg>
low but one $ole and uniform effect; that which $hould be di$co-
vered in the Water, would be a continuate and uniform cour$e
from Ea$t to We$t; and in that a Sea onely, which running com-
pa$s environeth the whole Globe. But in determinate Seas, $uch
as is the Mediterrane $hut up in the Ea$t, there could be no $uch
motion. For if its Water might be driven by the cour$e of
Heaven towards the We$t, it would have been dry many ages
$ince: Be$ides that our Water runneth not onely towards the
We$t, But returneth backwards towards the Ea$t, and that in or-
dinal Periods: And whereas you $ay by the example of Rivers,
that though the cour$e of the Sea were Originally that onely
<foot>from</foot>
<p n=>406</p>
from Ea$t to We$t, yet neverthele$s the different Po$ition of the
Shores may make part of the Water regurgitate, and return
backwards: I grant it you, but it is nece$$ary that you take no-
tice my <I>Simplicius,</I> that where the Water upon that account
returneth backwards, it doth $o there perpetually; and where
it runneth $traight forwards, it runneth there alwayes in the $ame
manner; for $o the example of the Rivers $hewes you: But in the
ca$e of the ebbing and flowing, you mu$t finde and give us $ome
rea$on why it doth in the $elf $ame place run one while one way,
and another while another; Effects that being contrary &amp; irregular,
can never be deduced from any uniform and con$tant Cau$e:
And this Argument, that overthrows the Hypothe$is of the mo-
tion contributed to the Sea from the Heavens diurnal motion,
doth al$o confute that Po$ition of tho$e who would admit the $ole
diurnal motion of the Earth, and believe that they are able with
that alone to give a rea$on of the Flux and Reflux: Of which
effect $ince it is irregular, the cau$e mu$t of nece$$ity be irregular
and alterable.</P>
<P>SIMP. I have nothing to reply, neither of my own, by rea$on
of the weakne$s of my under$tanding; nor of that of others, for
that the Opinion is $o new: But I could believe that if it were
$pread among$t the Schools, there would not want Phylo$ophers
able to oppo$e it.</P>
<P>SAGR. Expect $uch an occa$ion; and we in the mean time
if it $eem good to <I>Salviatus,</I> will proceed forward.</P>
<P>SALV. All that which hath been $aid hitherto, pertaineth to
the diurnal period of the ebbing and flowing; of which we have in
the fir$t place demon$trated in general the primary and univer$al
Cau$e, without which, no $uch effect would follow: Afterw ds
pa$$ing to the particular Accidents, various, and in a certain $ort
irregular, that are ob$erved therein: We have handled the $econ-
dary and concommitant Cau$es upon which they depend. Now
follow the two other Periods, Monethly, and Annual, which do
not bring with them new and different Accidents, other than
tho$e already con$idered in the diurnal Period; but they ope-
rate on the $ame Accidents, by rendring them greater and le$$er
in $everal parts of the Lunar Moneth, and in $everal times of
the Solar Year; as if that the Moon and Sun did each conceive
it $elf apart in operating and producing of tho$e Effects; a thing
that totally cla$heth with my under$tanding, which $eeing how
that this of Seas is a local and $en$ible motion, made in an im-
men$e ma$s of Water, it cannot be brought to $ub$cribe to
Lights, to temperate Heats, to predominacies by occult Quali-
ties, and to $uch like vain Imaginations, that are $o far from be-
ing, or being po$$ible to be Cau$es of the Tide; that on the con-
<foot>trary</foot>
<p n=>407</p>
trary, the Tide is the cau$e of them, that is, of bringing them
into the brains more apt for loquacity and o$tentation, than for
the $peculation and di$covering of the more ab$tru$e $ecrets of
Nature; which kind of people, before they can be brought to
prononnce that wi$e, ingenious, and mode$t $entence, <I>I know it
not,</I> $uffer to e$cape from their mouths and pens all manner of ex-
travagancies. And the onely ob$erving, that the $ame Moon, and
the $ame Sun operate not with their light with their motion, with
great heat, or with temperate, on the le$$er reeeptaces of Water,
but that to effect their flowing by heat, they mu$t be reduced to
little le$$e than boiling, and in $hort, we not being able artificially
to imitate any way the motions of the Tide, $ave only by the mo-
tion of the Ve$$el, ought it not to $atisfie every one, that all
the other things alledged, as cau$es of tho$e e$$ects, are
vaine fancies, and altogether e$tranged from the Truth. I
<marg><I>The al<*>ations
in the effe<*>s argue
alteration in the
cau$e.</I></marg>
$ay, therefore, that if it be true, that of one effect there is but
one $ole primary cau$e, and that between the cau$e and effect,
there is a firm and con$tant connection; it is nece$$ary that when-
$oever there is $een a firm and con$tant alteration in the effect,
there be a firm and con$tant alteration in the cau$e. And be-
cau$e the alterations that happen in the ebbing and flowing in
$everal parts of the Year and Moneths, have their periods firm and
con$tant, it is nece$$ary to $ay, that a regular alteration in tho$e
$ame times happeneth in the primary cau$e of the ebbings and
flowings. And as for the alteration that in tho$e times happens
<marg><I>The cau$es at
large a$$igned of
the Periods Mo-
nethly and Annu-
al of the ebbing
and flowing.</I></marg>
in the ebbings and flowings con$i$teth onely in their greatne$s;
that is, in the Waters ri$ing and falling more or le$$e, and in
running with greater or le$$e <I>impetus</I>; therefore it is nece$$ary,
that that which is the primary cau$e of the ebbing and flowing,
doth in tho$e $ame determinate times increa$e and dimini$h its
force. But we have already concluded upon the inequality and
irregularity of the motion of the Ve$$els containing the Water to
be the primary cau$e of the ebbings and flowings. Therefore
it is nece$$ary, that that irregularity, from time to time, corre-
$pondently grow more irregular, that is, grow greater and le$$er.
Now it is requi$ite, that we call to minde, that the irregularity,
that is, the different velocity of the motions of the Ve$$els, to
wit, of the parts of the Terre$trial Superficies, dependeth on
their moving with a compound motion, re$ulting from the com-
mixtion of the two motions, Annual and Diurnal, proper to the
whole Terre$trial Globe; of which the Diurnal conver$ion, by
one while adding to, and another while $ub$tracting from, the
Annual motion, is that which produceth the irregularity in the
compound motion; $o that, in the additions and $ub$tractions,
that the Diurnal revolution maketh from the Annual motion,
<foot>con-</foot>
<p n=>408</p>
con$i$teth the original cau$e of the irregular motion of the Ve$-
$els, and con$equently of the Ebbing and Flowing: in$omuch
<marg><I>The monethly
and annual altera-
tions of the tide can
depend upon no-
thing, $ave on the
alteration of the
additions &amp; $ub-
$tractions of the
diurnal period from
the annual.</I></marg>
that if the$e additions and $ub$tractions $hould alwayes proceed
in the $ame proportion, in re$pect of the Annual motion, the
cau$e of the Ebbing and Flowing would indeed continue, but
yet $o as that they would perpetually return in the $elf $ame man-
ner: But we are to finde out the cau$e of making the $ame Eb-
bings and Flowings in divers times greater and le$$er: There-
fore we mu$t (if we will retain the identity of the cau$e) find the
alteration in the$e <*>tions and $ub$tractions, that make them
more &amp; le$s potent, in producing tho$e effects which depend there-
upon. But I $ee not how that potency and impotence can be intro-
duced, unle$$e by making the $ame additions and $ub$tractions,
one while greater, and another while le$$er; $o that the accelera-
tion and the retardment of the compound motion, may be made,
$ometimes in greater, and $ometimes in le$$er proportion.</P>
<P>SAGR. I feel my $elf very gently led, as it were, by the hand,
and though I finde no rubs in the way, yet neverthele$$e, like a
blind man, I $ee not whether your Clue leadeth me, nor can I
imagine where $uch a Journey will end.</P>
<P>SALV. Though there be a great difference between my $low
pac't Philo$ophy, and your more nimble Rea$on, yet neverthe-
le$$e, in this particular which we are now upon, I do not much
wonder, if the apprehen$ivene$$e of your wit be a little ob$cu-
red by the dark and thick mi$t that hides the mark, at which we
aime: and that which le$$eneth my admiration is, the remem-
brance of the many hours, many dayes, yea more, many nights
that I have con$umed in this contemplation, and of the many
times that, de$pairing to bring it to a period, I have, for an in-
couragement of my $elf, indeavoured to believe, by the exam-
ple of the unfortunate <I>Orlando,</I> that that might not po$$ibly be
true, which yet the te$timony of $o many credible men $et be-
fore my eyes: wonder not, therefore, if this once, contrary to
your cu$tome, you do not fore$ee what I intend: and if you will
needs admire, I believe that the event, as far as I can judge un-
expected, will make you cea$e your wonderment.</P>
<P>SAGR. I thank God, that he did not permit that de$peration
of yours to end in the <I>Exit</I> that is fabled of the mi$erable <I>Or-
lando,</I> nor in that which haply is no le$$e fabulou$ly related of
<I>Ari$totle,,</I> that $o neither my $elf nor others $hould be deprived
of the di$covery of a thing, as ab$tru$e as it was de$irable: I
be$eech you, therefore, to $atisfie my eager appetite as $oon as
you can.</P>
<P>SALV. I am ready to $erve you: We were upon an inquiry
in what manner the additions and $ub$tractions of the Terre$tri-
<foot>all</foot>
<p n=>409</p>
all conver$ion from the Annual motion, could be made, one
while in a greater, and another while in a le$$er proportion;
which diver$ity, and no other thing, could be a$$igned for the
cau$e of the alterations, Monethly and Annual, that are $een in
the greatne$$e of the Ebbings and Flowings. I will now con-
$ider how this proportion of the additions and $ub$tractions of
<marg><I>Three wayes of
altering the pro-
portion of the ad-
ditions of the diur-
nal Revolution to
the annual motion.</I></marg>
the Diurnal Revolution, and Annual motion may grow greater
and le$$er three $everal wayes. One is by increa$ing and dimi-
ni$hing the velocity of the Annual motion, retaining the additi-
ons and $ub$tractions made by the Diurnal conver$ion in the
$ame greatne$$e, becau$e the Annual motion being about three
times greater, that is, more velocious than the Diurnal motion
(con$idered likewi$e in the Grand Circle) if we increa$e it
anew, the additions and $ub$tractions of the Diurnal motion
will occa$ion le$$e alteration therein: but, on the other $ide,
making it more $low, it will be altered in greater proportion, by
that $ame diurnal motion, ju$t as the adding or $ub$tracting
four degrees of velocity from one that moveth with twenty de-
grees, altereth his cour$e le$$e, than tho$e very four degrees would
do, added or $ub$tracted from one that $hould move onely with
ten degrees. The $econd way would be, by making the additi-
ons and $ub$tractions greater and le$$er, retaining the annual mo-
tion in the $ame velocity; which is as ea$ie to be under$tood, as it
is manife$t, that a velocity <I>v. gr.</I> of 20. degr. is more altered by the
addition or $ub$traction of 10. deg. than by the addition or $ub$tra-
ction of 4. The third way would be, in ca$e the$e two were joyned
together, dimini$hing the annual motion, &amp; increa$ing the diurnal
additions and $ub$tractions. Hitherto, as you $ee, it was no
hard matter <*>o attain, but yet it proved to me very hard to find
by what means this might be effected in Nature. Yet in the end,
<marg><I>That which <*>
us is hard to be un-
der$tood, i<*> with
Nature ea$ie to be
effected.</I></marg>
I finde that $he doth admirably make u$e thereof, and in wayes
almo$t incredible: I mean, admirable and incredible to us, but
not to her, who worketh even tho$e very things, which, to our
capacity, are of infinite wonder, with extraordinary facility and
$implicity: and that which it is hard for us to under$tand, is ea-
$ie for her to effect. Now to proceed, having $hewn that the
proportion between the additions and $ub$tractions of the Diur-
nal conver$ion and Annual motion may be made greater and le$-
$er, two wayes, (and I $ay two, becau$e the third is comprized in
the two fir$t) I adde, that Nature maketh u$e of them both:
and farthermore, I $ubjoyn, that if $he did make u$e but of one
alone, it would be nece$$ary to take away one of the two Perio-
dical alterations. That of the Monethly Period would cea$e, if
<marg><I>If the Diurnal
motion $hould not
alter, the annual
Period would cea$e</I></marg>
the annual motion $hould not alter. And in ca$e the additions
and $ub$tractions of the diurnal revolution $hould continually
<foot>Fff be</foot>
<p n=>410</p>
be equal, the alterations of the annual Period would fail.</P>
<P>SAGR. It $eems then, that the Monethly alteration of eb-
bings and flowings dependeth on the alteration of the annual
motion of the Earth? And the annual alteration of tho$e eb-
bings and flowings do, it $eems, depend on the additions and
$ub$tractions of the diurnal conver$ion? And here now I finde
my $elf wor$e puzzled than before, and more out of hope of
being able to comprehend how this intricacy may be, which is
more inextricable, in my judgment, than the Gordian knot. And
I envy <I>Simplicius,</I> from who$e $ilence I argue that he doth ap-
prehend the whole bu$ine$$e, and is acquit of that confu$ion
which greatly puzzleth my brains.</P>
<P>SIMP. I believe verily, <I>Sagredus,</I> that you are put to a
a $tand; and I believe that I know al$o the cau$e of your con-
fu$ion, which, if I mi$take not, ri$eth from your under$tanding
part of tho$e particulars but even now alledged by <I>Salviatus,</I>
and but a part. It is true likewi$e that I find my $elf free from the
like confu$ion; but not for that cau$e as you think, to wit, be-
cau$e I apprehend the whole, nay it happens upon the quite
contrary account; namely, from my not comprehending any
thing; and confu$ion is in the plurality of things, and not in
nothing.</P>
<P>SAGR. You $ee <I>Salviatus,</I> how a few checks given to <I>Simpli-
cius</I> in the dayes preceding, have rendered him gentle, and
brought him from the <I>capriol</I> to the <I>amble.</I> But I be$eech you
without farther delay, put us both out of $u$pence.</P>
<P>SALV. I will endeavour it to the utmo$t of my har$h way of
expre$$ing my $elf, the obtu$ene$$e of which, the acutene$$e of
your wit $hall $upply. The accidents of which we are to enquire
the cau$es are two: The fir$t re$pecteth the varieties that happen
in the ebbings and flowings in the Monethly Period; and the o-
thr relateth to the Annual. We will fir$t $peak of the Moneth-
ly, and then treat of the Annual; and it is convenient that we
re$olve them all according to the Fundamentals and Hypothe$is
already laid down, without introducing any novelty either in A-
$tronomy, or in the Univer$e, in favour of the ebbings and flow-
ings; therefore let us demon$trate that of all the $everal acci-
dents in them ob$erved, the cau$es re$ide in the things already
<marg><I>The true Hypo-
the$is may di$patch
its revolutions in a
$horter time, in
le$$er circles than
in greater; the
which is proved by
two examples.</I></marg>
known, and received for true and undoubted. I $ay therefore,
that it is a truly natural, yea nece$$ary thing, that one and the $ame
moveable made to move round by the $ame moving virtue in a
longer time, do make its cour$e by a greater circle, rather than
by a le$$er; and this is a truth received by all, and con-
firmed by all experiments, of which we will produce a few.
<marg><I>The fir$t ex-

In the wheel-clocks, and particularly in the great ones, to mo-
<foot>derate</foot>
<p n=>411</p>
derate the time, the Artificers that make them accomodate a cer-
tain voluble $taffe horozontally, and at each end of it they fa-
$ten two Weights of Lead, and when the time goeth too $low,
by the onely removing tho$e Leads a little nearer to the centre
of the $taffe, they render its vibrations more frequent; and on
the contrary to retard it, it is but drawing tho$e Weights more
towards the ends; for $o the vibrations are made more $eldome,
and con$equently the intervals of the hours are prolonged.</P>
<P>Here the movent vertue is the $ame, namely the counterpoi$e,
<marg><I>The $econd ex-

the moveables are tho$e $ame Weights of lead, and their vi-
brations are more frequent when they are neerer to the centre,
that is, when they move by le$$er circles. Hanging equal
Weights at unequal cords, and being removed from their per-
pendicularity, letting them go; we $hall $ee tho$e that are pen-
dent at the $horter cords, to make their vibrations under $horter
times, as tho$e that move by le$$er circles. Again, let $uch a
kind of Weight be fa$tened to a cord, which cord let play upon
a $taple fa$tened in the Seeling, and do you hold the other end
of the cord in your hand, and having given the motion to the
pendent Weight, whil$t it is making its vibrations, pull the
end of the cord that you hold in your hand, $o that the Weight
may ri$e higher and higher: In its ri$ing you $hall $ee the fre-
quency of its vibrations encrea$e, in regard that they are made
$ucce$$ively by le$$er and le$$er circies. And here I de$ire you to
<marg><I>Two particular
notable accidents
in the</I> pendu<*> <I>and
their vibrations.</I></marg>
take notice of two particulars worthy to be ob$erved. One is
that the vibrations of one of tho$e plummets are made with $uch
a nece$$ity under $uch determinate times, that it is altogether
impo$$ible to cau$e them to be made under other times, unle$$e
it be by prolonging, or abreviating the cord; of which you
may al$o at this very in$tant a$certain your $elves by experience,
tying a $tone to a pack-threed, and holding the other end in
your hand, trying whether you can ever by any artifice be able
to $wing it this way and that way in other than one determinate
time, unle$$e by lengthening or $hortening the $tring, which
you will find to be ab$olutely impo$$ible. The other particular
truly admirable is, that the $elf $ame <I>pendulum</I> makes its vibra-
tions with one and the $ame frequency, or very little, and as it
were in$en$ibly different, whether they be made by very great,
or very $mall arches of the $elf-$ame circumference. I mean that
whether we remove the <I>pendulum</I> from perpendicularity one, two,
or three degrees onely, or whether we remove it 70. 80. nay to
an entire quadrant, it being let go, will in the one ca$e and in
the other make its vibrations with the $ame frequency, as well
the former where it is to move by an arch of but four or $ix de-
grees, as the $econd, where it is to pa$$e arches of 160. or more
<foot>Fff 2 de-</foot>
<p n=>412</p>
degrees. Which may the better be $een, by hanging two weights
at two $trings of equal length, and then removing them from per-
pendicularity, one a little way, and the other very far; the which
being $et at liberty, will go &amp; return under the $ame times, the one
by arches very $mall, &amp; the other by very great ones, from whence
followeth the conclu$ion of an admirable Problem; which is,
<marg><I>Admirable Pro-
blems of movea-
bles de$cending by
the Quadrant of a
Circle, and of tho$e
de$cending by all
the cords of the
whole Circle.</I></marg>
That a Quadrant of a Circle being given (take a little diagram of
the $ame, [in <I>Fig.</I> 3.]) as for in$tance: A B erect to the Hori-
zon, $o as that it re$t upon the plain touching in the point B. and
an Arch being made with a Hoop well plained and $moothed in
the concave part, bending it according to the curvity of the Cir-
cumference A D B. So that a Bullet very round and $mooth
may freely run to and again within it (the rim of a Sieve is very
proper for the experiment) I $ay, that the Bullet being put in any
what ever place, neer or far from the lowe$t term B. As for in-
$tance, putting it in the point C, or here in D, or in E; and then
let go, it will in equal times, or in$en$ibly different arrive at the
term B, departing from C, or from D, or from E, or from what-
ever other place; an accident truly wonderfull. We may add
another accident no le$s $trange than this, which is, That more-
over by all the cords drawn from the point B to the points C,
D, E; and to any other what$oever, taken not onely in the Qua-
drant B A, but in all the whole circumference of the Circle the
$aid moveable $hall de$cend in times ab$olutely equal; in$omuch
that it $hall be no longer in de$cending by the whole Diameter
erect perpendicularly upon the point B, then it $hall in de$cend-
ing by B. C. although it do $ublend but one $ole degree, or a le$-
$er Arch. Let us add the other wonder, which is, That the mo-
tions of the falling bodies made by the Arches of the Quadrant
A B; are made in $horter times than tho$e that are made by the
cords of tho$e $ame Arches; $o that the $wifte$t motion, and
made by a moveable in the $horte$t time, to arrive from the
point A, to the term B, $hall be that which is made, not by the
right line A, B, (although it be the $horte$t of all tho$e that can
de drawn between the points A. B.) but by the circumference
A D B. And any point being taken in the $aid Arch; as for
example: The point D. and two co<*>ds drawn A D, and D. B.
the moveable departing from the qoint A, $hall in a le$s time
come to B, moving by the two cords A D and D B. than by the
$ole cord A, B. But the $horte$t of all the times $hall be that of
the fall by the Arch A D B. And the $elf $ame accidents are
to be under$tood of all the other le$$er Arches taken from the
lowermo$t term B. upwards.</P>
<P>SAGR. No more, no more; for you $o confund and fill me
with Wonders, and di$tract my thoughts $o many $everal wayes,
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>413</p>
that I fear I $hall have but a $mall part of it left free and di$in-
gaged, to apply to the principal matter that is treated of, and
which of it $elf is but even too ob$cure and intricate: So that
I intreat you to vouch$afe me, having once di$patcht the bu$ine$s
of the ebbings and flowings, to do this honour to my hou$e (and
yours) $ome other dayes, and to di$cour$e upon the $o many other
Problems that we have left in $u$pence; and which perhaps are
no le$s curious and admirable, than this that hath been di$cu$$ed
the$e dayes pa$t, and that now ought to draw to a con-
clu$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. I $hall be ready to $erve you, but we mu$t make more
than one or two Se$$ions; if be$ides the other que$tions re$erved
to be handled apart, we would di$cu$$e tho$e many that pertain
to the local motion, as well of natural moveables, as of the reject-
ed: an Argument largely treated of by our <I>Lyncean Accade-
mick.</I> But turning to our fir$t purpo$e, where we were about to
declare, That the bodies moving circularly by a movent virtue,
which continually remaineth the $ame, the times of the circula-
tions were prefixt and determined, and impo$$ible to be made
longer or $horter, having given examples, and produced experi-
ments thereof, $en$ible, and fea$ible, we may confirm the $ame
truth by the experiences of the Cele$tial motions of the Planets;
in which we $ee the $ame rule ob$erved; for tho$e that move by
greater Circles, confirm longer times in pa$$ing them. A mo$t
pertinent ob$ervation of this we have from the <I>Medic&aelig;an</I> Pla-
nets, which in $hort times make their revolutions about <I>Jupiter</I>:
In$omuch that it is not to be que$tioned, nay we may hold it for
$ure and certain, that if for example, the Moon continuing to be
moved by the $ame movent faculty, $hould retire by little and
little in le$$er Circles, it would acquire a power of abreviating
the times of its Periods, according to that <I>Pendulum,</I> of which in
the cour$e of its vibrations, we by degrees $hortned the cord, that
is contracted the Semidiameter of the circumferences by it pa$$ed.
Know now that this that I have alledged an example of it in the
Moon, is $een and verified e$$entially in fact. Let us call to mind,
that it hath been already concluded by us, together with <I>Coperni-</I>
<marg><I>The Earths an-
nual motion by the
Ecliptick, unequal
by means of the
Moons motion.</I></marg>
<I>cus,</I> That it is not po$$ible to $eparate the Moon from the Earth,
about which it without di$pute revolveth in a Moneth: Let us
remember al$o that the Terre$trial Globe, accompanyed alwayes
by the Moon, goeth along the circumference of the Grand Orb
about the Sun in a year, in which time the Moon revolveth about
the Earth almo$t thirteen times; from which revolution it follow-
eth, that the $aid Moon $ometimes is found near the Sun; that is,
when it is between the Sun and the Earth, and $ometimes
much more remote, that is, when the Earth is $ituate between
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>414</p>
the Moon and Sun; neer, in a word, at the time of its conjun
ction and change; remote, in its Full and Oppo$ition; and the
greate$t vicinity differ the quantity of the Diameter of the Lu-
nar Orb. Now if it be true that the virtue which moveth the
Earth and Moon, about the Sun, be alwayes maintained in
the $ame vigour; and if it be true that the $ame moveable
moved by the $ame virtue, but in circles unequal, do in $horter
times pa$$e like arches of le$$er circles, it mu$t needs be granted,
that the Moon when it is at a le$$e di$tance from the Sun, that is
in the time of conjunction, pa$$eth greater arches of the Grand
Orb, than when it is at a greater di$tance, that is in its Oppp$ition
and Full. And this Lunar inequality mu$t of nece$$ity be imparted
to the Earth al$o; for if we $hall $uppo$e a right line produced from
the centre of the Sun by the centre of the Terre$trial Globe, and
prolonged as far as the Orb of the Moon, this $hall be the $emi-
diameter of the Grand Orb, in which the Earth, in ca$e it were
alone, would move uniformly, but if in the $ame $emidiameter we
$hould place another body to be carried about, placing it one
while between the Earth and Sun, and another while beyond
the Earth, at a greater di$tance from the Sun, it is nece$$ary,
that in this $econd ca$e the motion common to both, according
to the circumference of the great Orb by means of the di$tance
of the Moon, do prove a little $lower than in the other ca$e,
when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, that is at a le$$er
di$tance. So that in this bu$ine$$e the very $ame happeneth that
befals in the time of the clock; that lead which is placed one
while farther $rom the centre, to make the vibrations of the
$taffe or ballance le$$e frequent, and another while nearer, to
make them thicker, repre$enting the Moon. Hence it may be
manife$t, that the annual motion of the Earth in the Grand
Orb, and under the Ecliptick, is not uniform, and that its ir-
regularity proceedeth from the Moon, and hath its Monethly
Periods and Returns. And becau$e it hath been concluded, that
the Monethly and Annual Periodick alterations of the ebbings
and flowings, cannot be deduced from any other cau$e than
from the altered proportion between the annual motion and the
additions and $ub$tractions of the diurnal conver$ion; and that
tho$e alterations might be made two wayes, that is by altering
the annual motion, keeping the quantity of the additions un-
altered, or by changing of the bigne$$e of the$e, reteining the
uniformity of annual motion. We have already found the fir$t
of the$e, depending on the irregularity of the annual motion
occa$ioned by the Moon, and which hath its Monethly Periods.
It is therefore nece$$ary, that upon that account the ebbings
and flowings have a Monethly Period in which they do grow
<foot>greater</foot>
<p n=>415</p>
greater and le$$er. Now you $ee that the cau$e of the Monethly
Period re$ideth in the annual motion; and withal you $ee how
much the Moon is concerned in this bu$ine$s, and how it is there-
with interrupted apart, without having any thing to do with either,
with Seas or Waters.</P>
<P>SAGR. If one that never had $een any kinde of Stairs or La-
der, were $hewed a very high Tower, and asked if ever he hoped
to climb to the top of it, I verily believe that he would an$wer he
did not, not conceiving how one $hould come thither any way
except by flying; but $hewing him a $tone of but a foot high, and
asking him whether he thought he could get to the top of that,
I am certain that he would an$wer he could; and farther, that he
would not deny, but that it was not onely one, but ten, twenty,
and an hundred times ea$ier to climb that: But now if he $hould
be $hewed the Stairs, by means whereof, with the facility by him
granted, it is po$$ible to get thither, whither he a little before had
affirmed it was impo$$ible to a$cend, I do think that laughing at
him$elf he would confe$s his dulne$s of apprehen$ion. Thus,
<I>Salviatus,</I> have you $tep by $tep $o gently lead me, that, not
without wonder, I finde that I am got with $mall pains to that
height which I de$paired of arriving at. 'Tis true; that the Stair-
ca$e having been dark, I did not perceive that I was got nearer
to, or arrived at the top, till that coming into the open Air I di$-
covered a great Sea, and $pacious Country: And as in a$cending
one $tep, there is no labour; $o each of your propo$itions by it
$elf $eemed to me $o plain, that thinking I heard but little or no-
thing that was new unto me, I conceived that my benefit thereby
had been little or none at all: Whereupon I was the more ama-
zed at the unexpected <I>exit</I> of this di$cour$e, that hath guided me
to the knowledge of a thing which I held impo$$ible to be de-
mon$trated. One doubt onely remains, from which I de$ire to
be freed, and this it is; Whether that if the motion of the Earth
together with that of the Moon under the Zodiack are irregular
motions, tho$e irregularities ought to have been ob$erved and ta-
ken notice of by <I>A$tronomers,</I> which I do not know that they
are: Therefore I pray you, who are better acquainted with the$e
things than I, to free me from this doubt, and tell me how the
ca$e $tands.</P>
<P>SALV. You ask a rational que$tion, and an$wering to the Ob-
<marg><I>Many things
may remain as yet
unob$erved in A-
$tronomy.</I></marg>
jection, I $ay; That although <I>A$tronomy</I> in the cour$es of many
ages hath made a great progre$s in di$covering the con$titution
and motions of the Cele$tial bodies, yet is it not hitherto arrived
at that height, but that very many things remain undecided, and
haply many others al$o undi$covered. It is to be $uppo$ed that the
fir$t ob$ervers of Heaven knew no more but one motion common
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>416</p>
to all the Stars, as is this diurnal one: yet I believe that in few
dayes they perceived that the Moon was incon$tant in keeping
company with the other Stars; but yet withal, that many years
pa$t, before that they di$tingui$hed all the Planets: And in par-
ticular, I conceit that <I>Saturn</I> by its $lowne$s, and <I>Mercury</I> by rea-
<marg>Saturn <I>for its
$lowne$s, and</I> Mer-
cury <I>for its rare-
ne$s of appearing
were among$t tho$e
that were la$t ob-
$erved.</I></marg>
$on of its $eldom appearing, were the la$t that were ob$erved to
be wand<*>ing and errant. It is to be thought that many more
years run out before the $tations and retrogradations of the three
$uperiour Planets were known, as al$o their approximations and
rece$$ions from the Earth, nece$$ary occa$ions of introducing the
Eccentrix and Epi<*>cles, things unknown even to <I>Ari$totle,</I> for
that he makes no mention thereof. <I>Mercury,</I> and <I>Venus,</I> with
their admirable apparitions; how long did they keep A$trono-
mers in $u$pence, before that they could re$olve (not to $peak of
any other of their qualities) upon their $ituation? In$omuch
that the very order onely of the Mundane bodies, and the inte-
gral $tructure of the parts of the Univer$e by us known, hath been
doubted of untill the time of <I>Copernicus,</I> who hath at la$t given
us notice of the true con$titution, and real $y$teme, according to
which tho$e parts are di$po$ed; $o that at length we are certain
that <I>Mercury, Venus,</I> and the other Planets do revolve about
the Sun; and that the Moon revolveth about the Earth. But
<marg><I>Particular $tru-
ctures of the Orbs
of the Planets not
yet well re$olved.</I></marg>
how each Planet governeth it $elf in its particular revolution, and
how preci$ely the $tructure of its Orb is framed; which is that
which is vulgarly called the <I>Theory</I> of the <I>Planets,</I> we cannot as
yet undoubtedly re$olve. <I>Mars,</I> that hath $o much puzled our
Modern A$tronomers, is a proof of this: And to the Moon her
$elf there have been a$$igned $everal Theories, after that the $aid
<I>Copernicus</I> had much altered it from that of <I>Ptolomy.</I> And to
de$cend to our particular ca$e, that is to $ay, to the apparent mo-
tion of the Sun and Moon; touching the former, there hath been
ob$erved a certain great irregularity, whereby it pa$$eth the two
<marg><I>The Sun pa$$-
eth one half of the
Zodiack nine days
$ooner than the
other.</I></marg>
$emicircles of the Ecliptick, divided by the points of the Equi-
noxes in very different times; in pa$$ing one of which, it $pend-
eth about nine dayes more than in pa$$ing the other; a difference,
as you $ee, very great and notable. But if in pa$$ing $mall arches,
$uch for example as are the twelve Signs, he maintain a mo$t re-
gular motion, or el$e proceed with paces, one while a little more
$wift, and another more $low, as it is nece$$ary that it do, in ca$e
the annual motion belong to the Sun onely in appearance, but
in reality to the Earth in company with the Moon, it is what hath
not hitherto been ob$erved, nor it may be, $ought. Touching
<marg><I>The Moons mo-
tion principally
$ought in the ac-
count of Eclip$es.</I></marg>
the Moon in the next place, who$e re$titutions have been prin-
cipally lookt into an account of the Eclip$es, for which it is $uf-
ficient to have an exact knowledge of its motion about the Earth,
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>417</p>
it hath not been likewi$e with a perfect curio$ity inquired, what
its cour$e is thorow the particular arches of the Zodiack. That
therefore the Earth and Moon in running through the Zodiack,
that is round the Grand Orb, do $omewhat accellerate at the
Moons change, and retard at its full, ought not to be doubted;
for that the $aid difference is not manife$t, which cometh to be
unob$erved upon two accounts; Fir$t, Becau$e it hath not been
lookt for. Secondly, Becau$e that its po$$ible it may not be very
great. Nor is there any need that it $hould be great, for the pro-
ducing the effect that we $ee in the alteration of the greatne$s of
ebbings and flowings. For not onely tho$e alterations, but the
<marg><I>Ebbings and
flowings are petty
things in com<*>ari-
$on of the va$tne$s
of Seas, and of the
velocity of the mo-
tion of the Terre-
$trial Globe.</I></marg>
Tides them$elves are but $mall matters in re$pect of the grandure
of the $ubjects on which they work; albeit that to us, and to our
littlene$s they $eem great. For the addition or $ubduction of
one degree of velocity where there are naturally 700, or 1000,
can be called no great alteration, either in that which conferreth
it, or in that Which receiveth it: the Water of our Mediterrane
carried about by the diurnal revolution, maketh about 700 miles
an hour, (which is the motion common to the Earth and to it, and
therefore not perceptible to us) &amp; that which we $en$ibly di$cern
to be made in the $treams or currents, is not at the rate of full one
mile an hour, (I $peak of the main Seas, and not of the Straights)
and this is that which altereth the fir$t, naturall, and grand mo-
tion; and this motion is very great in re$pect of us, and of Ships:
for a Ve$$el that in a $tanding Water by the help of Oares can
make <I>v. g.</I> three miles an hour, in that $ame current will row
twice as far with the $tream as again$t it: A notable difference
in the motion of the Boat, though but very $mall in the motion
of the Sea, which is altered but its $even hundredth part. The
like I $ay of its ri$ing, and falling one, two, or three feet; and
$carcely four or five in the utmo$t bounds of a $treight, two thou-
$and, or more miles long, and where there are depths of hundreds
of feet; this alteration is much le$s than if in one of the Boats
that bring us fre$h Water, the $aid Water upon the arre$t of the
Boat $hould ri$e at the Prow the thickne$s of a leaf. I conclude
therefore that very $mall alterations in re$pect of the immen$e
greatne$s, and extraordinary velocity of the Seas, is $ufficient to
make therein great mutations in relation to our $mallne$s, and to
our accidents.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am fully $atisfied as to this particular; it remains to
declare unto us how tho$e additions and $ub$tractions derived
from the diurnal <I>Vertigo</I> are made one while greater, and ano-
ther while le$$er; from which alterations you hinted that the an-
nual period of the augmentations and diminutions of the eb-
bings and flowings did depend.</P>

<P>SALV. I will u$e my utmo$t endeavours to render my $elf
<marg><I>The cau$es of

diurnal conver$ion
from the annual

intelligible, but the difficulty of the accident it $elf, and the
great attention of mind requi$ite for the comprehending of it,
con$trains me to be ob$cure. The unequalities of the additions
and $ub$tractions, that the diurnal motion maketh to or from
the annual dependeth upon the inclination of the Axis of the di-
urnal motion upon the plane of the Grand Orb, or, if you plea$e,
of the Ecliptick; by means of which inclination the Equinoctial
inter$ecteth the $aid Ecliptick, remaining inclined and oblique
upon the $ame according to the $aid inclination of Axis. And the
quantity of the additions importeth as much as the whole diame-
ter of the $aid Equinoctial, the Earths centre being at the $ame
time in the Sol$titial points; but being out of them it importeth
le$$e and le$$e, according as the $aid centre $ucce$$ively approa-
cheth to the points of the Equinoxes, where tho$e additions are
le$$er than in any other places. This is the whole bu$ine$$e, but
wrapt up in the ob$curity that you $ee.</P>
<P>SAGR. Rather in that which I do no not $ee; for hitherto I
comprehend nothing at all.</P>
<P>SALV. I have already foretold it. Neverthele$$e we will try
whether by drawing a Diagram thereof, we can give $ome
$mall light to the $ame; though indeed it might better be $et
forth by $olid bodies than by bare Schemes; yet we will help our
$elves with Per$pective and fore-$hortning. Let us draw there-
fore, as before, the circumference of the Grand Orb, [<I>as in
Fig.</I> 4.] in which the point A is under$tood to be one of the
Sol$titials, and the diameter A P the common Section of the
Sol$titial Colure, and of the plane of the Grand Orb or Eclip-
tick; and in that $ame point A let us $uppo$e the centre of the
Terre$trial Globe to be placed, the Axis of which C A B, in-
clined upon the Plane of the Grand Orb, falleth on the plane of
the $aid Colure that pa$$eth thorow both the Axis of the Equino-
ctial, and of the Ecliptick. And for to prevent confu$ion, let
us only draw the Equinoctial circle, marking it with the$e chara-
cters D G E F, the common $ection of which, with the plane of
the grand Orb, let be the line D E, $o that half of the $aid E-
quinoctial D F E will remain inclined below the plane of the
Grand Orb, and the other half D G E elevated above. Let
now the Revolution of the $aid Equinoctial be made, according
to the order of the points D G E F, and the motion of the cen-
tre from A towards E. And becau$e the centre of the Earth
being in A, the Axis C B (which is erect upon the diameter of
the Equinoctial D E) falleth, as hath been $aid, in the Sol$ti-
tial Colure, the common Section of which and of the
Grand Orb, is the diameter P A, the $aid line P A $hall
<foot>be</foot>
<p n=>419</p>
be perpendicular to the $ame D E, by rea$on that the Colure is
erect upon the grand Orb; and therefore the $aid D E,
$hall be the Tangent of the grand Orb in the point A.
So that in this Po$ition the motion of the Centre by the arch
A E; that is, of one degree every day differeth very little; yea,
is as if it were made by the Tangent D A E. And becau$e by
means of the diurnal motion the point D, carried about by G,
unto E, encrea$eth the motion of the Centre moved almo$t in the
$ame line D E, as much as the whole diameter D E amounts
unto; and on the other $ide dimini$heth as much, moving about
the other $emicircle E F D. The additions and $ubductions
in this place therefore, that is in the time of the $ol$tice, $hall be
mea$ured by the whole diameter D E.</P>
<P>Let us in the next place enquire, Whether they be of the $ame
bigne$s in the times of the <I>E</I>quinoxes; and tran$porting the
Centre of the Earth to the point I, di$tant a Quadrant of a
Circle from the point A. Let us $uppo$e the $aid Equinoctial
to be G E F D, its common $ection with the grand Orb D E, the
Axis with the $ame inclination C B; but the Tangent of the grand
Orb in the point I $hall be no longer D E, but another which
$hall cut that at right Angles; and let it be this marked H I L,
according to which the motion of the Centre I, $hall make its pro-
gre$s, proceeding along the circumference of this grand Orb.
Now in this $tate the Additions and Sub$tractions are no longer
mea$ured by the diameter D E, as before was done; becau$e that
diameter not di$tending it $elf according to the line of the annual
motion H L, rather cutting it at right angles, tho$e terms D E, do
neither add nor $ub$tract any thing; but the Additions and
Sub$tractons are to be taken from that diameter that falleth
in the plane that is errect upon the plane of the grand Orb, and
that inter$ects it according to the line H L; which diameter in this
ca$e $hall be this G F and the Adjective, if I may $o $ay, $hall
be that made by the point G, about the $emicircle G E F, and the
Ablative $hall be the re$t made by the other $emicircle F D G.
Now this diameter, as not being in the $ame line H L of the
annual motion, but rather cutting it, as we $ee in the point I, the
term G being elevated above, and E depre$$ed below the plane
of the grand Orb, doth not determine the Additions and Sub-
$tractions according to its whole length, but the quantity of tho$e
fir$t ought to be taken from the part of the line H L, that is in-
tercepted between the perpendiculars drawn upon it from the
terms G F; namely, the$e two G S, and F V: So that the mea-
$ure of the additions is the line S V le$$er then G F, or then D E;
which was the mea$ure of the additions in the Sol$tice A. And
$o $ucce$$ively, according as the centre of the Earth $hall be con-
<foot>Ggg 2 $tituted</foot>
<p n=>420</p>
$tituted in other points of the Quadrant A I, drawing the Tan-
gents in the $aid points, and the perpndiculars upon the $ame fal-
ling from the terms of the diameters of the Equinoctial drawn
from the errect planes by the $aid Tangents to the plane of the
grand Orb; the parts of the $aid Tangents (which $hall conti-
nually be le$$er towards the Equinoctials, and greater towards the
Sol$tices) $hall give us the quantities of the additions and $ub$tra-
ctions. How much in the next place the lea$t additions differ from
the greate$t, is ea$ie to be known, becau$e there is the $ame dif-
ference betwixt them, as between the whole Axis or Diameter of
the Sphere, and the part thereof that lyeth between the Polar-
Circles; the which is le$s than the whole diameter by very near a
twelfth part, $uppo$ing yet that we $peak of the additions and
$ub$tractions made in the Equinoctial; but in the other Paral-
lels they are le$$er, according as their diameters do dimini$h.</P>
<P>This is all that I have to $ay upon this Argument, and all perhaps
that can fall under the comprehen$ion of our knowledge, which,
as you well know, may not entertain any conclu$ions, $ave onely
tho$e that are firm and con$tant, $uch as are the three kinds of Pe-
riods of the ebbings and flowings; for that they depend on cau$es
that are invariable, $imple, and eternal. But becau$e that $e-
condary and particular cau$es, able to make many alterations, in-
termix with the$e that are the primary and univer$al; and the$e
$econdary cau$es being part of them incon$tant, and not to be
ob$erved; as for example, The alteration of Winds, and part
(though terminate and fixed) unob$erved for their multiplicity,
as are the lengths of the Straights, their various inclinations to-
wards this or that part, the $o many and $o different depths of the
Waters, who $hall be able, unle$s after very long ob$ervations, and
very certain relations, to frame $o expeditious Hi$tories thereof, as
that they may $erve for Hypoth e$es, and certain $uppo$itions to
$uch as will by their combinations give adequate rea$ons of all the
appearances, and as I may $ay, Anomalie, and particular irregula-
rities that may be di$covered in the motions of the Waters? I
will content my $elf with adverti$ing you, that the accidental
cau$es are in nature, and are able to produce many alterations;
for the more minute ob$ervations, I remit them to be made by
tho$e that frequent $everal Seas: and onely by way of a conclu-
$ion to this our conference, I will propo$e to be con$idered, how
that the preci$e times of the fluxes and refluxes do not onely hap-
pen to be altered by the length of Straights, and by the diffe-
rence of depths; but I believe that a notable alteration may al$o
proceed from the comparing together of $undry tarcts of Sea,
different in greatne$s; and in po$ition, or, if you will, inclina-
tion; which difference happeneth exactly here in the <I>Adriatick</I>
<foot>Gulph,</foot>
<p n=>421</p>
Gulph, le$$e by far than the re$t of the Mediterrane, and placed in
$o different an inclination, that whereas that hath its bounds that
inclo$eth it on the Ea$tern part, as are the Coa$ts of <I>Syria,</I> this is
$hut up in its more We$terly part: and becau$e the ebbings and
flowings are much greater towards the extremities, yea, becau$e
the Seas ri$ings and fallings are there onely greate$t, it may pro-
bably happen that the times of Flood at <I>Venice</I> may be the time of
low Water in the other Sea, which, as being much greater, and
di$tended more directly from We$t to Ea$t, cometh in a certain
$ort to have dominion over the <I>Adriatick:</I> and therefore it
would be no wonder, in ca$e the effects depending on the pri-
mary cau$es, $hould not hold true in the times that they ought,
and that corre$pond to the periods in the <I>Adriatick,</I> as it doth
in the re$t of the Mediterrane. But the$e Particularities require
long Ob$ervations, which I neither have made as yet, nor $hall I
ever be able to make the $ame for the future.</P>
<P>SAGR. You have, in my opinion, done enough in opening us
the way to $o lofty a $peculation, of which, if you had given us
no more than that fir$t general Propo$ition that $eemeth to me to
admit of no reply, where you declare very rationally, that the
Ve$$els containing the Sea-waters continuing $tedfa$t, it would
be impo$$ible, according to the common cour$e of Nature, that
tho$e motions $hould follow in them which we $ee do follow;
and that, on the other $ide, granting the motions a$cribed, for o-
ther re$pects, by <I>Copernicus</I> to the Terre$trial Globe, the$e $ame
alterations ought to en$ue in the Seas, if I $ay you had told us no
more, this alone in my judgment, $o far exceeds the vanities in-
troduced by $o many others, that my meer looking on them
makes me nau$eate them, and I very much admire, that among
men of $ublime wit, of which neverthele$s there are not a few,
not one hath ever con$idered the incompatibility that is between
the reciprocal motion of the Water contained, and the immobi-
lity of the Ve$$el containing, which contradiction $eemeth to me
now $o manife$t.</P>
<P>SALV. It is more to be admired, that it having come into the
<marg><I>One $ingle moti-

not to produce the
Ebbing &amp; Flowing</I></marg>
thoughts of $ome to refer the cau$e of the Tide to the motion of
the Earth, therein $hewing a more than common apprehen$ion,
they $hould, in afterwards driving home the motion clo$e with
no $ide; and all, becau$e they did not $ee that one $imple and
uniform motion, as <I>v. gr.</I> the $ole diurnal motion of the Terre-
$trial Globe, doth not $uffice, but that there is required an une-
ven motion, one while accelerated, and another while retarded:
for when the motion of the Ve$$els are uniforme, the waters
contained will habituate them$elves thereto, without ever ma-
king any alteration. To $ay al$o (as it is related of an ancient
<foot>Mathe-</foot>
<p n=>422</p>
<marg><I>The opinion of</I>
Seleucus <I>the Ma-

motion of the Lunar Orb, the concurrence of them occa$ioneth
the Ebbing and Flowing, is an ab$olute vanity, not onely be-
cau$e it is not expre$t, nor $een how it $hould $o happen, but the
fal$ity is obvious, for that the Revolution of the Earth is not con-
trary to the motion of the Moon, but is towards the $ame way.
So that all that hath been hitherto $aid, and imagined by others,
is, in my judgment, altogether invalid. But among$t all the
famous men that have philo$ophated upon this admirable effect
<marg>Kepler <I>is with

being of a free and piercing wit, and having the motion a$cri-
bed to the Earth, before him, hath for all that given his ear and
a$$ent to the Moons predominancy over the Water, and to oc-
cult properties, and $uch like trifles.</P>

$ons the $ame happened, that at pre$ent befalls me, namely, the
not under$tanding the intricate commixtion of the three Periods
Annual, Monethly, and Diurnal; And how their cau$es $hould
$eem to depend on the Sun, and on the Moon, without the Suns
or Moons having any thing to do with the Water; a bu$ine$$e,
for the full under$tanding of which I $tand in need of a little
longer time to con$ider thereof, which the novelty and difficulty
of it hath hitherto hindred me from doing: but I de$pair not, but
that when I return in my $olitude and $ilence to ruminate that
which remaineth in my fancy, not very well dige$ted, I $hall
make it my own. We have now, from the$e four dayes Di$-

among$t which the$e three taken: the fir$t, from the Stations and
Retrogradations of the Planets, and from their approaches, and
rece$$ions from the Earth; the $econd, from the Suns revolving
in it $elf, and from what is ob$erved in its $pots; the third, from
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea do $hew very rational and

paradox; and you <I>Sagredus,</I> although in the Di$cour$es pa$t
you have many times, with great applau$e, declared, that you
were plea$ed with $ome of my conjectures, yet do I believe, that
that was in part more occa$ioned by the novelty than by the cer-
tainty of them, but much more by your courte$ie, which did
think and de$ire, by its a$$ent, to procure me that content which
we naturally u$e to take in the approbation and applau$e of our
own matters: and as your civility hath obliged me to you; $o
am I al$o plea$ed with the ingenuity of <I>Simplicius.</I> Nay, his
con$tancy in maintaining the Doctrine of his Ma$ter, with $o
much $trength &amp; undauntedne$s, hath made me much to love him.
And as I am to give you thanks, <I>Sagredus,</I> for your courteous a$-
fection; $o of <I>Simplicius,</I> I ask pardon, if I have $ometimes
moved him with my too bold and re$olute $peaking: and let him
be a$$ured that I have not done the $ame out of any inducement
of $ini$ter affection, but onely to give him occa$ion to $et before
us more lofty fancies that might make me the more knowing.</P>
<P>SIMP. There is no rea$on why you $hould make all the$e ex-
cu$es, that are needle$$e, and e$pecially to me, that being accu-
$tomed to be at Conferences and publique Di$putes, have an
hundred times $een the Di$putants not onely to grow hot and an-
gry at one another, but likewi$e to break forth into injurious
words, and $ometimes to come very neer to blows. As for the
pa$t Di$cour$es, and particulatly in this la$t, of the rea$on of
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, I do not, to $peak the truth,
very well apprehend the $ame, but by that $light <I>Idea,</I> what e-
ver it be, that I have formed thereof to my $elf, I confe$$e that
your conceit $eemeth to me far more ingenuous than any of all
<foot>tho$e</foot>
<p n=>424</p>
tho$e that I ever heard be$ides, but yet neverthele$$e I e$teem it
not true and concluding: but keeping alwayes before the eyes
of my mind a $olid Doctrine that I have learn't from a mo$t
learned and ingenuous per$on, and with which it is nece$$ary to
$it down; I know that both you being asked, Whether God, by
his infinite Power and Wi$dome might confer upon the Element
of Water the reciprocal motion which we ob$erve in the $ame in
any other way, than by making the containing Ve$$el to move; I
know, I $ay, that you will an$wer, that he might, and knew how
to have done the $ame many wayes, and tho$e unimaginable to
our $hallow under$tanding: upon which I forthwith conclude,
that this being granted, it would be an extravagant boldne$$e
for any one to goe about to limit and confine the Divine
Power and Wi$dome to $ome one particular conjecture of
his own.</P>
<P>SALV. This of yours is admirable, and truly Angelical Do-
ctrine, to which very exactly that other accords, in like manner
divine, which whil$t it giveth us leave to di$pute, touching the
con$titution of the World, add<*>th withall (perhaps to the end,
that the exerci$e of the minds of men might neither be di$cou-
raged, nor made bold) that we cannot find out the works made
by his hands. Let therefore the Di$qui$ition permitted and or-
dain'd us by God, a$$i$t us in the knowing, and $o much more
admiring his greatne$$e, by how much le$$e we finde our $elves
too dull to penetrate the profound Aby$$es of his infinite Wi$-
dome.</P>
<P>SAGR. And this may $erve for a final clo$e of our four dayes
Di$putations, after which, if it $eem good to <I>Salviatus,</I> to take
$ome time to re$t him$elf, our curio$ity mu$t, of nece$$ity, grant
him the $ame, yet upon condition, that when it is le$$e incommo-
dious for him, he will return and $atisfie my de$ire in particular
concerning the Problemes that remain to be di$cu$t, and that I
have $et down to be propounded at one or two other Conferen-
ces, according to our agreement: and above all, I $hall very
impatiently wait to hear the Elements of the new Science of our
<I>Academick</I> about the natural and violent local Motions. And
in the mean time, we may, according to our cu$tome, $pend an
hour in taking the Air in the <I>Gondola</I> that waiteth for us.</P>

<P>Some years $ince, as Your mo$t Serene Highne$s well
knoweth, I did di$cover many particulars in Hea-
ven that had been un$een and unheard of untill
this our Age; which, as well for their Novelty, as
for certain con$equences which depend upon
them, cla$hing with $ome Phy$ical Propo$itions commonly recei-
ved by the Schools, did $tir up again$t me no $mall number of
$uch as profe$$ed the vulgar Philo$ophy in the Univer$ities; as if
I had with my own hand newly placed the$e things in Heaven to
ob$cure and di$turb Nature and the Sciences: who forgetting
that the multitude of Truths contribute, and concur to the inve-
$tigation, augmentation, and e$tabli$hment of the Arts, and not to
their diminution, and de$truction; and at the $ame time $hewing
them$elves more affectionate to their own Opinions, than to
Truth, went about to deny, and to di$prove tho$e Novelties; of
which their very $en$e, had they but plea$ed to have inten$ly be-
held them, would have rendered them thorowly a$$ured. And
to this purpo$e they alledged $undry things, and publi$hed cer-
tain Papers fraughted with vain di$cour$es; and which was a
more gro$s errour, interwoven with the atte$tations of the Sacred
Scriptures, taken from places by them not rightly under$tood,
and which did not any thing concern the point for which they
were produced Into which errour perhaps they would not
have run, if they had but been adverti$ed of a mo$t profitable
Document which S. <I>Augu$tine</I> giveth us, concerning our pro-
ceeding warily, in making po$itive determinations in points that
<foot>Hhh 2 are</foot>
<p n=>428</p>
are ob$cure and hard to be under$tood by the meer help of
ratiocination; where treating (as we) of a certain natural conclu-
$ion concerning Cele$tial Bodies, he thus writes: <I>(a) But now</I>
<marg><I>(a) Nunc au-

per moderatione pi&aelig;

$cur&acirc; temer&egrave; de-

<I>having evermore a re$pect to the moderation of pious Gravity,
we ought to believe nothing unadvi$edly in a doubtful point; le$t
we conceive a prejudice again$t that, in favour to our Errour,
which Truth hereafter may di$cover to be no wi$e contrary to the
Sacred Books either of the Old, or New Te$tament.</I></P>
<P>It hath $ince come to pa$s, that Time hath by degrees di$co-
vered to every one the truths before by me indicated: and to-
gether with the truth of the fact, a di$covery hath been made of
the difference of humours between tho$e who $imply and with-
out pa$$ion did refu$e to admit $uch like <I>Ph&aelig;nomena</I> for true, and
tho$e who to their incredulity had added $ome di$compo$ed af-
fection: For as tho$e who were better grounded in the Science of
<marg>Lib_{+} 2. Gene$i
ad Literam in
fine.</marg>
A$tronomy, and Natural Philo$ophy, became $atisfied upon my
fir$t ntimation of the news; $o all tho$e who $tood not in the
Negative, or in doubt for any other rea$on, but becau$e it was
an unlookt-for-Novelty, and becau$e they had not an occa$ion of
$eeing a $ensible experiment thereof, did by degrees come to $a-
risfie them$elves: But tho$e, who be$ides the love they bore to
their fir$t Errour, have I know not what imaginary intere$s to
render them di$affected; not $o much towards the things, as to-
wards the Author of them, not being able any longer to deny
them, conceal them$elves under an ob$tinate $ilence; and being
exa$perated more than ever by that whereby tho$e others were
$atisfied and convinced, they divert their thoughts to other pro-
jects, and $eek to prejudice me $ome other wayes: of whom I
prore$s that I would make no more account than I have done of
tho$e who heretofore have contradicted me (at whom I alwaies
laugh, as being a$$ured of the i$$ue that the bu$ine$s is to have)
but that I $ee that tho$e new Calumnies and Per$ecutions do not
determine in our greater or le$ier Learning (in which I will $carce
pretend to any thing) but extend $o far as to attempt to a$per$e
me with Crimes which ought to be, and are more abhorred by me
than Death it $elf: Nor ought I to content my $elf that they
are known to be unju$t by tho$e onely who know me and them,
but by all men what$oever. They per$i$ting therefore in their
fir$t Re$olution, Of ruining me and what$oever is mine, by all
imaginable waies; and knowing how that I in my Studies of
A$tronomy and Philo$ophy hold, as to the Worlds Sy$teme,
That the Sun, without changing place, is $ituate in the Centre
of the Conver$ion of the Cele$tial Orbes; and that the Earth,
convertible about its own Axis, moveth it $elf about the Sun:
And moreover under$tanding, that I proceed to maintain this Po-
<foot>$ition</foot>
<p n=>429</p>
$ition, not onely by refuting the Rea$ons of <I>Ptolomy</I> and <I>Ari$to-
tle,</I> but by producing many on the contrary; and in particular,
$ome Phy$ical pertaining to Natural Effects, the cau$es of which
perhaps can be by no other way a$$igned; and others A$trono-
mical depending upon many circum$tances and encounters of
new Di$coveries in Heaven, which manife$tly confute the Ptolo-
maick Sy$teme, and admirably agree with and confirm this other
Hypothe$is: and po$$ibly being a$hamed to $ee the known truth
of other Po$itions by me a$$erted, different from tho$e that have
been commonly received; and therefore di$tru$ting their de-
fence $o long as they $hould continue in the Field of Philo$o-
phy: for the$e re$pects, I $ay, they have re$olved to try whe-
ther they could make a Shield for the fallacies of their Argu-
ments of the Mantle of a feigned Religion, and of the Autho-
rity of the Sacred Scriptures, applyed by them with little judg-
ment to the confutation of $uch Rea$ons of mine as they had
neither under$tood, nor $o much as heard.</P>
<P>And fir$t, they have indeavoured, as much as in them lay, to
divulge an opiniou thorow the Univer$e, that tho$e Propo$itions
are contrary to the Holy Letters, and con$equently Damnable
and Heretical: And thereupon perceiving, that for the mo$t
part, the inclination of Mans Nature is more prone to imbrace
tho$e enterprizes, whereby his Neighbour may, although un-
ju$tly, be oppre$$ed, than tho$e from whence he may receive
ju$t incouragement; it was no hard matter to find tho$e Com-
plices, who for $uch (that is, for Damnable and Heretical) did
from their Pulpits with unwonted confidence preach it, with but
an unmerciful and le$s con$iderate injury, not only to this Do-
ctrine, and to its followers, but to all Mathematicks and Ma-
thematicians together. Hereupon a$$uming greater confidence,
and vainly hoping that that Seed which fir$t took root in their un-
$ound mindes, might $pread its branches, and a$cend towards
Heaven, they went $cattering rumours up and down among the
People, That it would, ere long be condemned by Supreme Au-
thority: and knowing that $uch a <I>Cen$ure</I> would $upplant
not onely the$e two Conclu$ions of the Worlds Sy$teme, but
would make all other A$tronomical and Phy$ical Ob$ervations
that have corre$pondence and nece$$ary connection therewith to
become damnable, to facilitate the bu$ine$s they $eek all they
can to make this opinion (at lea$t among the vulgar) to $eem new,
and peculiar to my $elf, not owning to know that <I>Nicholas Coper-
nicus</I> was its Authour, or rather Re$torer and Confirmer: a per-
$on who was not only a Catholick, but a Prie$t, Canonick, and
$o e$teemed, that there being a Di$pute in the <I>Lateran Council,</I>
under <I>Leo</I> X. touching the correction of the Eccle$ia$tick Ca-
<foot>lender</foot>
<p n=>430</p>
lendar, he was $ent for to <I>Rome</I> from the remote$t parts of
<I>Germany,</I> for to a$$i$t in this Reformation, which for that time
was left imperfect, onely becau$e as then the true mea$ure of
the Year and Lunar Moneth was not exactly known: whereupon
it was given him in charge by the Bi$hop of <I>Sempronia,</I> at that
time Super-intendent in that Affair, to $earch with reiterated
$tudies and pains for greater light and certainty, touching tho$e
C&oelig;le$tial Motions. Upon which, with a Labour truly <I>Atlantick</I>
and with his admirable Wit, $etting him$elf again to that Study,
he made $uch a progre$s in the$e Sciences, and reduced the
knowledge of the C&oelig;le$tial Motions to $uch exactne$$e, that he
gained the title of an Excellent <I>A$tronomer.</I> And, according
unto his Doctrine, not only the Calendar hath been $ince regu-
lated, but the Tables of all the Motions of the Planets have al-
$o been calculated: and having reduced the $aid Doctrine into
$ix Books, he publi$hed them to the World at the in$tance of
the Cardinal of <I>Capua,</I> and of the Bi$hop of <I>Culma.</I> And in
regard that he had re-a$$umed this $o laborious an enterprize by
the order of The Pope; he dedicated his Book <I>De Revolutioni-
bus C&oelig;le$tibus</I> to His Succe$$our, namely <I>Paul</I> III. which, being
then al$o Printed, hath been received by The Holy Church, and
read and $tudied by all the World, without any the lea$t um-
brage of $cruple that hath ever been conceived at his Doctrine;
The which, whil$t it is now proved by manife$t Experiments and
nece$$ary Demon$trations to have been well grounded, there
want not per$ons that, though they never $aw that $ame Book in-
tercept the reward of tho$e many Labours to its Authour, by
cau$ing him to be cen$ured and pronounced an Heretick; and
this, only to $atisfie a particular di$plea$ure conceived, without
any cau$e, again$t another man, that hath no other intere$t in
<I>Copernicus,</I> but only as he is an approver of his Doctrine.</P>
<P>Now in regard of the$e fal$e a$per$ions, which they $o unju$tly
$eek to throw upon me, I have thought it nece$$ary for my ju$ti-
fication before the World (of who$e judgment in matters of
Religion and Reputation I ought to make great e$teem) to
di$cour$e concerning tho$e Particulars, which the$e men produce
to $candalize and $ubvert this Opinion, and in a word, to con-
demn it, not only as fal$e, but al$o as Heretical; continually
making an Hipocritical Zeal for Religion their Shield; going a-
bout moreover to intere$t the Sacred Scriptures in the Di$pute,
and to make them in a certain $en$e Mini$ters of their deceiptful
purpo$es: and farthermore de$iring, if I mi$take not, contrary to
the intention of them, and of the Holy Fathers to extend (that I
may not $ay abu$e) their Authority, $o as that even in Conclu$ions
meerly Natural, and not <I>de Fide,</I> they would have us altogether
<foot>leave</foot>
<p n=>431</p>
leave Sen$e and Demon$trative Rea$ons, for $ome place of Scri-
pture which $ometimes under the apparent words may contain
a different $en$e. Now I hope to $hew with how much
greater Piety and Religious Zeal I proceed, than they do, in that
I propo$e not, that the Book of <I>Copernicus</I> is not to be condemn-
ed, but that it is not to be condemned, as they would have it;
without under$tanding it, hearing it, or $o much as $eeing it;
and e$pecially he being an Author that never treateth of matters
of Religion or Faith; nor by Rea$ons any way depending on the
Authority of Sacred Scripoures whereupon he may have erroni-
ou$ly interpreted them; but alwaies in$i$ts upon Natural Conclu-
$ions belonging to the Cele$tial Motions, handled with A$trono-
mical and Geometrical Demon$trations. Not that he had not a

re$pect to the places of the Sacred Leaves, but becau$e he knew
very well that his $aid Doctrine being demon$trated, it could
not contradict the Scriptures, rightly, and according to their true
meaning under$tood. And therefore in the end of his Epi$tle
Dedicatory, $peaking to The Pope, he $aith thus: <I>(b) If there
$hould chance to be any Mat&aelig;ologi$ts, who though ignorant in all
the Mathematicks, yet pretending a skill in tho$e Learnings,
$hould dare, upon the authority of $ome place of Scripture wre$ted
to their purpo$e, to condemn and cen$ure this my Hypothe$is, I
value them not, but $hall $light their incon$iderate Judgement. For
it is not unknown, that</I> Lactantius (<I>otherwi$e a Famous Author,
though mean Mathematician) writeth very childi$hly touching the
Form of the Earth, when he $coffs at tho$e who affirm the Earth to
be in Form of a Globe. So that it ought not to $eem $trange to the
Ingenious, if any $uch $hould likewi$e now deride us. The Ma-
thematicks are written for Mathematitians, to whom (if I deceive
not my $elf) the$e Labours of mine $hall $eem to add $omething,
as al$o to the Common-weale of the Church, who$e Government is
now in the hands of Your Holine$s.</I></P>
<P>And of this kinde do the$e appear to be who indeavour to
per$wade that <I>Copernicus</I> may be condemned before his Book is
read; and to make the World believe that it is not onely lawfull
but commendable $o to do, produce certain Authorities of the
Scripture, of Divines, and of Councils; which as they are by me
had in reverence, and held of Supream Authority, in$omuch that
I $hould e$teem it high temerity for any one to contradict them
whil$t they are u$ed according to the In $titutes of Holy Church,
$o I believe that it is no errour to $peak, $o long as one hath rea-
$on to $u$pect that a per$on hath a de$ire, for $ome concern of
his own, to produce and alledge them, to purpo$es different from
tho$e that are in the mo$t Sacred intention of The Holy Church.
Therefore I not onely prote$t (and my $incerity $hall manife$t it
<foot>$elf)</foot>
<p n=>432</p>
$elf) that I intend to $ubmit my $elf freely to renounce tho$e et-
rors, into which, through ignorance, I may run in this Di$cour$e
of matters pertaining to Religion; but I farther declare, that I
de$ire not in the$e matters to engage di$pute with any one, al-
though it $hould be in points that are di$putable: for my end
endeth onely to this, That if in the$e con$iderations, be$ides my
own profe$$ion, among$t the errours that may be in them, there
be any thing apt to give others an hint of $ome Notion beneficial
to the Holy Church, touching the determining about the <I>Coper-
nican</I> Sy$teme, it may be taken and improved as $hall $eem be$t
to my Superiours: If not, let my Book be torn and burnt; for
that I do neither intend, nor pretend to gain to my $elf any fruit
from my writings, that is not Pious and Catholick. And more-
over, although that many of the things that I ob$erve have been
$poken in my own hearing, yet I $hall freely admit and grant to
tho$e that $pake them, that they never $aid them, if $o they
plea$e, but confe$s that I might have been mi$taken: And
therefore what I $ay, let it be $uppo$ed to be $poken not by them,
but by tho$e which were of this opinion.</P>
<P>The motive therefore that they produce to condemn the Opi-
nion of the Mobility of the Earth, and Stability of the Sun, is, that
reading in the Sacred Leaves, in many places, that the Sun mo-
veth, that the Earth $tandeth $till; and the Scripture not being
capable of lying, or erring, it followeth upon nece$$ary con$e-
quence, that the Po$ition of tho$e is Erronious and Heretical, who
maintain that the Sun of it $elf is immoveable, and the Earth
moveable.</P>
<P>Touching this Rea$on I think it fit in the fir$t place, to con-
$ider, That it is both piou$ly $poken, and prudently affirmed, That
the Sacred Scripture can never lye, when ever its true meaning is
under$tood: Which I believe none will deny to be many times
very ab$truce, and very different from that which the bare $ound
of the words $ignifieth. Whence it cometh to pa$s, that if ever
any one $hould con$tantly confine him$elf to the naked Gram-
matical Sence, he might, erring him$elf, make not only Contra-
dictions and Propo$itions remote from Truth to appear in the
Scriptures, but al$o gro$s Here$ies and Bla$phemies: For that we
$hould be forced to a$$ign to God feet, and hands, and eyes, yea
more corporal and humane affections, as of Anger, of Repen-
tance, of Hatred, nay, and $ometimes the Forgetting of things
pa$t, and Ignorance of tho$e to come: Which Propo$itions, like
as ($o the Holy Gho$t affirmeth) they were in that manner pro-
nounced by the Sacred Scriptures, that they might be accommo-
dated to the Capacity of the Vulgar, who are very rude and un-
learned; $o likewi$e, for the $akes of tho$e that de$erve to be di-
<foot>$tingui$hed</foot>
<p n=>433</p>
$tingui$hed from the Vulgar, it is nece$$ary that grave and skilful
Expo$itors produce the true $en$es of them, and $hew the parti-
cular Rea$ons why they are dictated under $uch and $uch words.
And this is a Doctrine $o true and common among$t Divines,
that it would be $uperfluous to produce any atte$tation
thereof.</P>
<P>Hence methinks I may with much more rea$on conclude, that
the $ame holy Writ, when ever it hath had occa$ion to pronounce
any natural Conclu$ion, and e$pecially, any of tho$e which are
more ab$truce, and difficult to be under$tood, hath not failed to
ob$erve this Rule, that $o it might not cau$e confu$ion in the
mindes of tho$e very people, and render them the more contu-
macious again$t the Doctrines that were more $ublimely my$teri-
ous: For (like as we have $aid, and as it plainly appeareth) out
of the $ole re$pect of conde$cending to Popular Capacity, the
Scripture hath not $crupled to $hadow over mo$t principal and
fundamental Truths, attributing, even to God him$elf, qualities
extreamly remote from, and contrary unto his E$$ence. Who
would po$itively affirm that the Scripture, laying a$ide that re-
$pect, in $peaking but occa$ionally of the Earth, of the Water, of
the Sun, or of any other Creature, hath cho$en to confine it
$elf, with all rigour, within the bare and narrow literal $en$e of
the words? And e$pecially, in mentioning of tho$e Crea-
tures, things not at all concerning the primary In$titution of
the $ame Sacred Volume, to wit, the Service of God, and the
$alvation of Souls, and in things infinitely beyond the appre-
hen$ion of the Vulgar?</P>
<P>This therefore being granted, methinks that in the Di$cu$$ion
of Natural Problemes, we ought not to begin at the authority
of places of Scripture; but at Sen$ible Experiments and Ne-
ce$$ary Demon$trations: For, from the Divine Word, the
Sacred Scripture and Nature did both alike proceed; the fir$t,
as the Holy Gho$ts In$piration; the $econd, as the mo$t ob$er-
vant Executrix of Gods Commands: And moreover it being
convenient in the Scriptures (by way of conde$cen$ion to the
under$tanding of all men) to $peak many things different, in
appearance; and $o far as concernes the naked $igni$ication of
the words, from ab$olute truth: But on the contrary, Nature
being inexorable and immutable, and never pa$$ing the bounds

come to a certainty in any Natural Conclu$ions, we ought
to make u$e of them, as mo$t appo$ite helps to the true Expo-
$ition of the $ame Scriptures, and to the inve$tigation of tho$e
Sen$es which are nece$$arily conteined in them, as mo$t true, and
concordant with the Truths demon$trated.</P>
<P>This maketh me to $uppo$e, that the Authority of the Sacred
Volumes was intended principally to per$wade men to the be-
lief of tho$e Articles and Propo$itions, which, by rea$on they
$urpa$s all humane di$cour$e, could not by any other Science, or
by any other means be made credible, than by the Mouth of
the Holy Spirit it $elf. Be$ides that, even in tho$e Propo$itions,
which are not <I>de Fide,</I> the Authority of the $ame Sacred Leaves
ought to be preferred to the Authority of all Humane Sciences
that are not written in a Demon$trative Method, but either with
bare Narrations, or el$e with probable Rea$ons; and this I hold
to be $o far convenient and nece$$ary, by how far the $aid Di-
vine Wi$dome $urpa$$eth all humane Judgment and Conjecture.
But that that $elf $ame God who hath indued us with Sen$es,
Di$cour$e, and Under$tanding hath intended, laying a$ide the
u$e of the$e, to give the knowledg of tho$e things by other means,
which we may attain by the$e, $o as that even in tho$e Natural
Conclu$ions, which either by Sen$ible Experiments or Nece$$ary
Demon$trations are $et before our eyes, or our Under$tanding, we
ought to deny Sen$e and Rea$on, I do not conceive that I am
bound to believe it; and e$pecially in tho$e Sciences, of which
but a $mall part, and that divided into Conclu$ions is to be
found in the Scripture: Such as, for in$tance, is that of <I>A$tro-
nomy,</I> of which there is $o $mall a part in Holy Writ, that it doth
not $o much as name any of the Planets, except the Sun and the
Moon, and once or twice onely <I>Venus</I> under the name of <I>Luci-
fer.</I> For if the Holy Writers had had any intention to per$wade
People to believe the Di$po$itions and Motions of the C&oelig;le$tial
Bodies; and that con$equently we are $till to derive that know-
<foot>ledge</foot>

ledge from the Sacred Books they would not, in my opinion, have
$poken $o little thereof, that it is as much as nothing, in compa-
ri$on of the infinite admirable Conclu$ions, which in that Sci-
ence are comprized and demon$trated Nay, that the Authours
of the Holy Volumes did not only not pretend to teach us the
Con$titutions and Motions of the Heavens and Stars, their Fi-
gures, Magnitudes, and Di$tances, but that intentionally (al-
beit that all the$e things were very well known unto them) they

forbore to $peak of them, is the opinion of the Mo$t Holy &amp; Mo$t
Learned Fathers: and in S. <I>Augu$tine</I> we read the following words.
<I>(c) It is likewi$e commonly asked, of what Form and Figure
we may believe Heaven to be, according to the Scriptures: For
many contend much about tho$e matters, which the greater pru-
dence of our Authors hath forborn to $peak of, as nothing further-
ing their Learners in relation to able$$ed life; and, (which is
the chiefe$t thing) taking up much of that time which $hould be
$pent in holy exerci$es. For what is it to me whether Heaven, as
a Sphere, doth on all $ides environ the Earth, a Ma$s ballanced in
the middle of the World; or whether like a Di$h it doth onely cover
or overca$t the $ame? But becau$e belief of Scripture is urged for
that cau$e, which we have oft mentioned, that is, That none through
ignorance of Divine Phra$es, when they $hall find any thing of this
nature in, or hear any thing cited out of our Bibles which may $eem
to oppo$e manife$t Conclu$ions, $hould be induced to $u$pect their
truth, when they admoni$h, relate, &amp; deliver more profitable matters
Briefly be it $poken, touching the Figure of Heaven, that our Au-
thors knew the truth: But the H. Spirit would not, that men $hould
learn what is profitable to none for $alvation.</I></P>
<P>And the $ame intentional $ilence of the$e $acred Penmen in
determining what is to be believed of the$e accidents of the Ce-
le$tial Bodies, is again hinted to us by the $ame Father in the en-
$uing 10. Chapter upon the Que$tion, Whether we are to believe
that Heaven moveth, or $tandeth $till, in the$e words: <I>(d) There</I>

<P>From which (that we may come nearer to our particular ca$e)
it nece$$arily followeth, that the Holy Gho$t not having intend-

whether its Figure be in Form of a Sphere, or of a Di$cus, or di-
$tended <I>in Planum</I>: Nor whether the Earth be contained in the
Centre of it, or on one $ide; he hath much le$s had an intention
to a$$ure us of other Conclu$ions of the $ame kinde, and in $uch
a manner, connected to the$e already named, that without the
dedermination of them, one can neither affirm one or the other
part; which are, The determining of the Motion and Re$t of the
$aid Earth, and of the Sun. And if the $ame Holy Spirit hath
purpo$ely pretermitted to teach us tho$e Propo$itions, as nothing
concerning his intention, that is, our $alvation; how can it be af-
firmed, that the holding of one part rather than the other, $hould
be $o nece$$ary, as that it is <I>de Fide,</I> and the other erronious?
Can an Opinion be Heretical, and yet nothing concerning the
$alvation of $ouls? Or can it be $aid that the Holy Gho$t purpo-
$ed not to teach us a thing that concerned our $alvation? I might

<foot><I>again$t</I></foot>
<p n=>437</p>
<I>again$t the Truth, not the $en$e of the Scripture (which is be-
yond his comprehen$ion) but rather his own; not what is in it, but
what, finding it in him$elf, he fancyed to be in it.</I></P>
<P>This granted, and it being true, (as hath been $aid) that two
Truths cannot be contrary to each other, it is the office of a
Judicious Expo$itor to $tudy to finde the true Sen$es of Sacred
Texts, which undoubtedly $hall accord with tho$e Natural Con-
clu$ions, of which manife$t Sen$e and Nece$$ary Demon$trations
<marg>Epi$t. 7. ad Mar-
cellinum.</marg>
had before made us $ure and certain. Yea, in regard that the
Scriptures (as hath been $aid) for the Rea$ons alledged, admit in
many places Expo$itions far from the Sen$e of the words; and
moreover, we not being able to affirm, that all Interpreters
$peak by Divine In$piration; For (if it were $o) then there
would be no difference between them about the Sen$es of the
$ame places; I $hould think that it would be an act of great pru-
dence to make it unlawful for any one to u$urp Texts of Scri-
pture, and as it were to force them to maintain this or that Natu-
rall Conclu$ion for truth, of which Sence, &amp; Demon$trative, and
nece$$ary Rea$ons may one time or other a$$ure us the contrary.
For who will pre$cribe bounds to the Wits of men? Who will
a$$ert that all that is $en$ible and knowable in the World is al-
ready di$covered and known? Will not they that in other points
di$agree with us, confe$s this (and it is a great truth) that <I>Ea
qu&aelig; $cimus, $int minima pars eorum qu&aelig; ignoramus</I>? That tho$e
Truths which we know, are very few, in compari$on of tho$e
which we know not? Nay more, if we have it from the Mouth
<marg>Eccle$ia$t. cap. 3.</marg>
of the Holy Gho$t, that <I>Deus tradidit Mundum di$putationi
eorum, ut non inveniat homo opus, quod operatus e$t Deus ab
initio ad finem:</I> One ought not, as I conceive, to $top the way
to free Philo$ophating, touching the things of the World, and of
Nature, as if that they were already certainly found, and all ma-
nife$t: nor ought it to be counted ra$hne$s, if one do not fit
down $atisfied with the opinions now become as it were com-
mune; nor ought any per$ons to be di$plea$ed, if others do not
hold, in natural Di$putes to that opinion which be$t plea$eth
them; and e$pecially touching Problems that have, for thou$ands
of years, been controverted among$t the greate$t Philo$ophers, as is
the Stability of the Sun, and Mobility of the Earth, an opinion
held by <I>Pythagoras,</I> and by his whole Sect; by <I>Heraclides Pon-
ticus,</I> who was of the $ame opininion; by <I>Phylolaus,</I> the Ma$ter
of <I>Plato</I>; and by <I>Plato</I> him$elf, as <I>Ari$totle</I> relateth, and of
which <I>Plutarch</I> writeth in the life of <I>Numa,</I> that the $aid <I>Plato,</I>
when he was grown old, $aid, It is a mo$t ab$urd thing to think
otherwi$e: The $ame was believed by <I>Ari$tarchus Samius,</I> as
we have it in <I>Archimedes</I>; and probably by <I>Archimedes</I> him-
<foot>$elf;</foot>
<p n=>438</p>
$elf; by <I>Nicetas</I> the Philo$opher, upon the te$timony of <I>Scicero,</I>
and by many others. And this opinion hath, finally, been am-
plified, and with many Ob$ervations and Demon$trations con-
firmed by <I>Nicholaus Copernicus.</I> And <I>Seneca,</I> a mo$t eminent
Philo$opher, in his Book <I>De Cometis,</I> advertizeth us that we
ought, with great diligence, $eek for an a$$ured knowledge,
whether it be Heaven, or the Earth, in which the Diurnal Con-
ver$ion re$ides.</P>
<P>And for this cau$e, it would probably be prudent and pro$i-
table coun$el, if be$ides the Articles which concern our Salvati-
on, and the e$tabli$hment of our Faith (again$t the $tability of
which there is no fear that any valid and $olid Doctrine can e-
ver ri$e up) men would not aggregate and heap up more, with-
out nece$$ity: And if it be $o, it would certainly be a prepo$te-
rous thing to introduce $uch Articles at the reque$t of per$ons
who, be$ides that we know not that they $peak by in$piration
of Divine Grace, we plainly $ee that there might be wi$hed in
them the under$tanding which would be nece$$ary fir$t to enable
them to comprehend, and then to di$cu$s the Demon$trations
wherewith the $ubtiler Sciences proceed in confirming $uch like
Conclu$ions. Nay, more I $hould $ay, (were it lawful to $peak
my judgment freely on this Argument) that it would haply
more $uit with the <I>Decorum</I> and Maje$ty of tho$e Sacred Vo-
lumes, if care were taken that every $hallow and vulgar Writer
might not authorize his Books (which are not $eldome grounded
upon fooli$h fancies) by in$erting into them Places of Holy Scri-
pture, interpreted, or rather di$torted to Sen$es as remote from
the right meaning of the $aid Scripture, as they are neer to deri-
ri$ion, who not without o$tentation flouri$h out their Writings
therewith. Examples of $uch like abu$es there might many be
produced, but for this time I will confine my $elf to two, not
much be$ides the$e matters of <I>A$tronomy:</I> One of which, is that
of tho$e Pamphlets which were publi$hed again$t the <I>Medicean</I>
Planets, of which I had the fortune to make the di$covery; a-
gain$t the exi$tence of which there were brought many places of
Sacred Sctipture: Now, that all the World $eeth them to be
Planets, I would gladly hear with what new interpretations
tho$e very Antagoni$ts do expound the Scripture, and excu$e their
own $implicity. The other example is of him who but very
lately hath Printed again$t <I>A$tronomers</I> and <I>Philo$ophers,</I> that
the Moon doth not receive its light from the Sun, but is of its own
nature re$plendent: which imagination he in the clo$e confirm-
eth, or, to $ay better, per$wadeth him$elf that he confirmeth by
$undry Texts of Scripture, which he thinks cannot be reconciled
unle$$e his opinion $hould be true and nece$$ary. Neverthele$$e,
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>439</p>
the Moon of it $elf is Tenebro$e, and yet it is no le$$e lucid than
the Splendor of the Sun.</P>
<P>Hence it is manife$t, that the$e kinde of Authors, in regard they
did not dive into the true Sence of the Scriptures, would (in ca$e
their authority were of any great moment) have impo$ed a nece$-
$ity upon others to believe $uch Conclu$ions for true as were re-
pugnant to manife$t Rea$on, and to Sen$e. Which abu$e <I>Deus
avertat,</I> that it do not gain Countenance and Authority; for if it
$hould, it would in a $hort time be nece$$ary to pro$cribe and in-
hibit all the Contemplative Sciences. For being that by nature
the number of $uch as are very unapt to under$tand perfectly
both the Sacred Scriptures, and the other Sciences is much great-
er than that of the skilfull and intelligene; tho$e of the fir$t $ort
$uperficially running over the Scriptures, would arrogate to them-
$elves an Authority of decreeing upon all the Que$tions in Na-
ture, by vertue of $ome Word by them mi$onder$tood, and pro-
duced by the Sacred Pen-men to another purpo$e: Nor would
the $mall number of the Intelligent be able to repre$s the furious
Torrent of tho$e men, who would finde $o many the more fol-
lowers, in that the gaining the reputation of Wi$e men without
pains or Study, is far more grateful to humane Nature, than the
con$uming our $elves with re$tle$s contemplations about the mo$t
painfull Arts. Therefore we ought to return infinite thanks to
Almighty God, who of his Goodne$s freeth us from this fear, in
that he depriveth $uch kinde of per$ons of all Authority and, re-
po$eth the Con$ulting, Re$olving, and Decreeing upon $o im-
portant Determinations in the extraordinary Wi$dom and Can-
dor of mo$t Sacred Fathers; and in the Supream Authority of
tho$e, who being guided by his Holy Spirit, cannot but determin
Holily: So ordering things, that of the levity of tho$e other men,
there is no account made. This kinde of men are tho$e, as I be-
lieve, again$t whom, not without Rea$on, Grave, and Holy Wri-
ters do $o much inveigh; and of whom in particular S. <I>Hierom</I>

by Authority of the Scriptures to follow that opinion in Natu-
ral Di$putations, which they think mo$t agreeth with the Texts
of that: Holding withall, that they are not bound to an$wer
the Rea$ons and Experiments on the contrary: In Explication
and Confirmation of which their judgement they $ay, That <I>The-
ologie</I> being the Queen of all the Sciences, $he ought not upon
any account to $toop to accomodate her $elf to the Po$itions of
the re$t, le$s worthy, and inferior to her: But that they ought
to refer them$elves to her (as to their Supream Empere$s) and
change and alter their Conclu$ions, according to <I>Theological</I>
Statutes and Decrees. And they further add, That if in the
inferior Science there $hould be any Conclu$ion certain by ver-
tue of Demon$trations or experiments, to which there is found
in Scripture another Conclu$ion repugnant; the very Profe$$ors
of that Science ought of them$elves to re$olve their Demon$trati-
ons, and di$cover the falacies of their own Experiments, without
repairing to Theologers and Textuaries, it not $uiting (as hath
been $aid) with the dignity of <I>Theologie</I> to $toop to the inve$tiga-
tion of the falacies of the inferior Sciences: But it $ufficeth her,
to determine the truth of the Conclu$ion with her ab$olute Au-
thority, and by her infallibility. And then the Natural Conclu-
$ions in which they $ay that we ought to bide by the meer Au-
thority of the Scripture, without glo$$ing, or expounding it to
Sen$es different from the Words, they affirm to be Tho$e of
which the Scripture $peaketh alwaies in the $ame manner; and
the Holy Fathers all receive, and expound to the $ame
Sen$e.</P>
<P>Now as to the$e Determinations, I have had occa$ion to con$i-
der $ome particulars (which I will purpo$e) for that I was made
cautious thereof, by tho$e who under$tand more than I in the$e
bu$ine$$es, and to who$e judgments I alwaies $ubmit my $elf.
And fir$t I could $ay, that there might po$$ibly a certain kinde of
equivocation interpo$e, in that they do not di$tingui$h the prehe-
minences whereby Sacred <I>Theologie</I> meriteth the Title of Queen.
<foot>For</foot>
<p n=>441</p>
For it might be called $o, either becau$e that that which is taught
by all the other Sciences, is found to be comprized and demon$tra-
ted in it, but with more excellent means, and with more $ublime
Learning; in like manner, as for example; The Rules of mea$uring
of Land, &amp; of Accountant$hip are much more excellently contain-
ed in the Arithmatick and Geometry of <I>Euclid,</I> than in the Practi-
$es of Surveyours and Accomptants: Or becau$e the Subject about
which <I>Theologie</I> is conver$ant, excelleth in Dignity all the other
Subjects, that are the Matters of other Sciences: As al$o becau$e
its Documents are divulged by nobler waies. That the Title
and Authority of Queen belongeth to <I>Theologie</I> in the fir$t
Sen$e, I think that no Theologers will affirm, that have but any
in-$ight into the other Sciences; of which there are none (as I be-
lieve) that will $ay that Geometry, A$tronomy Mu$ick, and Me-
dicine are much more excellently and exactly contained in the
Sacred Volumes, than in the Books of <I>Archimedes,</I> in <I>Ptolomy,</I> in
<I>Boetius,</I> and in <I>Galen.</I> Therefore it is probable that the Regal
Preheminence is given her upon the $econd account, namely, By
rea$on of the Subject, and the admirable communicating of the
Divine Revelations in tho$e Conclu$ions which by other means
could not be conceived by men, and which chiefly concern the
acqui$t of eternal Beatitude. Now if <I>Theologie</I> being conver-
$ant about the loftie$t Divine Contemplation, and re$iding for
Dignity in the Regal Throne of the Sciences, (whereby $he be-
cometh of highe$t Authority) de$cendeth not to the more mean
and humble Speculations of the inferior Sciences: Nay; (as hath
been declared above) hath no regard to them, as not concerning
Bearitude; the Profe$$ors thereof ought not to arrogate to them-
$elves the Authority to determin of Controver$ies in tho$e Pro-
fe$$ions which have been neither practi$ed nor $tudied by them.
For this would be as if an Ab$olute Prince, knowing that he
might freely command, and cau$e him$elf to be obeyed, $hould
(being neither Phi$itian nor Architect) undertake to admini$ter
Medicines, and erect Buildings after his own fa$hion, to the great
endangering af the lives of the poor Patients, and to the manife$t
de$truction of the Edifices.</P>
<P>Again, to command the very Profe$$ors of <I>A$tronomy,</I> that
they of them$elves $ee to the confuting of their own Ob$erva-
tions and Demon$trations, as tho$e that can be no other but
Falacies and Sophi$mes, is to enjoyn a thing beyond all po$$ibi-
lity of doing: For it is not onely to command them that they do
not $ee that which they $ee, and that they do not under$tand
that which they under$tand; but that in $eeking, they finde the
contrary of that which they happen to meet with. Therefore be-
fore that this is to be done, it would be nece$$ary that they were
<foot>Kkk $hewed</foot>
<p n=>442</p>
$hewed the way how to make the Powers of the Soul to command
one another, and the inferior the Superior; $o that the imaginati-
on and will might, and $hould believe contrary to what the Intel-
lect under$tands: I $till mean in Propo$itions purely Natural, and
which are not <I>de Fide,</I> and not in the Supernatural, which are
<I>de Fide.</I></P>
<P>I would entreat the$e Wi$e and Prudent Fathers, that they
would withal diligence con$ider the difference that is between
Opinable and Demon$trative Doctrines: To the end, that well
weighing in their minds with what force Nece$$ary Illations ob-
lige, they might the better a$certain them$elves, that it is not in
the Power of the Profe$$ors of Demon$trative Sciences to change
their Opinions at plea$ure, and apply them$elves one while to
one $ide, and another while to another; and that there is a great
difference between commanding a Methametitian or a Philo$o-
pher, and the di$po$ing of a Lawyer or a Merchant; and that the
demon$trated Conclu$ions touching the things of Nature and of
the Heavens cannot be changed with the $ame facility, as the
Opinions are touching what is lawful or not in a Contract, Bar-
gain, or Bill of Exchange. This difference was well under$tood
by the Learned and Holy Fathers, as their having been at great
pains to confute many Arguments, or to $ay better, many Phi-

lo$ophical Fallacies, doth prove unto us; and as may expre$ly be
read in $ome of them, and particularly we have in S. <I>Augu$tine</I>
the following words: <I>(g) This is to be held for an undoubt-
ed Truth, That we may be confident, that whatever the Sages of
this World have demon$trated touching Natural Points, is no waies
contrary to our Bibles: And in ca$e they teach any thing in their
Books that is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, we may without any
$cruple conclude it to be mo$t fal$e; And aceording to our ability
let us make the $ame appear: And let us $o keep the Faith of our
Lord, in whom are hidden all the Trea$ures of Wi$dom; that we
be neither $educed with the Loquacity of fal$e Philo$ophy, nor
$cared by the $uper$tition of a counterfeit Religion.</I></P>
<P>From which words, I conceive that I may collect this Do-
ctrine, namely, That in the Books of the Wi$e of this World,
there are contained $ome Natural truths that are $olidly demon-
$trated, and others again that are barely taught; and that as to
the fir$t $ort, it is the Office of wi$e Divines to $hew that they
are not contrary to the Sacred Scriptures; As to the re$t, taught,
but not nece$$arily demon$trated, if they $hall contain any thing
contrary to the Sacred Leaves, it ought to be held undoubtedly
fal$e, and $uch it ought by all po$$ible waies to be demon-
$trated.</P>
<marg>Gen. ad Litteram.
<I>lib</I> I. Cap. 25.</marg>
<P>If therefore Natural Conclu$ions veritably demon$trated, are
<foot>not</foot>
<p n=>443</p>
not to be po$tpo$ed to the Places of Scripture, but that it ought
to be $hewn how tho$e Places do not interfer with the $aid Con-
clu$ions; then its nece$$ary before a Phy$ical Propo$ition be
condemned, to $hew that it is not nece$$arily demon$trated; and
this is to be done not by them who hold it to be true, but by tho$e
who judge it to be fal$e. And this $eemeth very rea$onable,
and agreeable to Nature; that is to $ay, that they may much
more ea$ily find the fallacies in a Di$cour$e, who believe it to be
fal$e, than tho$e who account it true and concludent. Nay, in
this particular it will come to pa$$e, that the followers of this o-
pinion, the more that they $hall turn over Books, examine the
Arguments, repeat the Ob$ervations, and compare the Experi-
ments, the more $hall they be confirmed in this belief. And your
Highne$s knoweth what happened to the late Mathematick Pro-
fe$$or in the Univer$ity of <I>Pi$a,</I> Who betook him$elf in his old
age to look into the Doctrine of <I>Copernicus,</I> with hope that he
might be able $olidly to confute it (for that he held it $o far to
be fal$e, as that he had never $tudied it) but it was his fortune,
that as $oon as he had under$tood the grounds, proceedings, and
demon$trations of <I>Copernicus,</I> he found him$elf to be per$waded,
and of an oppo$er became his mo$t confident Defender. I
might al$o nominate other ^{*} Mathematicians, who being moved
<marg>* P. Clavius the
Je$uite.</marg>
by my la$t Di$coveries, have confe$$ed it nece$sary to change the
formerly received Con$titution of the World, it not being able
by any means to $ub$i$t any longer.</P>
<P>If for the bani$hing this Opinion and Hypothe$is out of the
World, it were enough to $top the mouth of one alone, as it
may be they per$wade them$elves who mea$uring others judge-
ments by their own, think it impo$$ible that this Doctrine $hould
be able to $ub$i$t and finde any followers, this would be very ea-
$ie to be done, but the bu$ine$s $tandeth otherwi$e: For to
execute $uch a determination, it would be nece$$ary to prohibite
not onely the Book of <I>Copernicus,</I> and the Writings of the o-
ther Authors that follow the $ame opinion, but to interdict the
whole Science of <I>A$tronomy</I>; and which is more, to forbid men
looking towards Heaven, that $o they might not $ee <I>Mars</I> and
<I>Venus</I> at one time neer to the Earth, and at another farther off,
with $uch a difference that the latter is found to be fourty times,
and the former $ixty times bigger in $urface at one time than at
another; and to the end, that the $ame <I>Venus</I> might not be
di$covered to be one while round, and another while forked, with
mo$t $ubtil hornes: and many other $en$ible Ob$ervations which
can never by any means be reconciled to the <I>Ptolomaick</I> Sy$teme,
but are unan$werable Arguments for the <I>Copernican.</I></P>
<P>But the prohibiting of <I>Copernicus</I> his Book, now that by many
<foot>Kkk 2 new</foot>
<p n=>444</p>
new Ob$ervations, and by the application of many of the Lear-
ned to the reading of him, his Hypothe$is and Doctrine doth
every day appear to be more true, having admitted and tolerated
it for $o many years, whil$t he was le$$e followed, $tudied, and
confirmed, would $eem, in my judgment, an affront to Truth,
and a $eeking the more to ob$cure and $uppre$$e her, the more
$he $heweth her $elf clear and per$picuous.</P>
<P>The aboli$hing and cen$uring, not of the whole Book, but
onely $o much of it as concerns this particular opinion of the
<I>Earths Mobility,</I> would, if I mi$take not, be a greater detriment
to $ouls, it being an occa$ion of great $candal, to $ee a Po$ition
proved, and to $ee it afterwards made an Here$ie to believe it.</P>
<P>The prohibiting of the whole Science, what other would it
be but an open contempt of an hundred Texts of the Holy Scri-
ptures, which teach us, That the Glory, and the Greatne$$e of
Almighty God is admirably di$cerned in all his Works, and di-
vinely read in the Open Book of Heaven? Nor let any one
think that the Lecture of the lofty conceits that are written in
tho$e Leaves fini$h in only beholding the Splendour of the Sun,
and of the Stars, and their ri$ing and $etting, (which is the term
to which the eyes of bruits and of the vulgar reach) but there
are couched in them my$teries $o profound, and conceipts $o $ub-
lime, that the vigils, labours, and $tudies of an hundred and an
hundred acute Wits, have not yet been able thorowly to dive
into them after the continual di$qui$ition of $ome thou$ands of
years. But let the Unlearned believe, that like as that which
their eyes di$cern in beholding the a$pect of a humane body, is
very little in compari$on of the $tupendious Artifices, which an
exqui$ite and curious Anatomi$t or Philo$opher finds in the $ame
when he is $earching for the u$e of $o many Mu$cles, Tendons,
Nerves, and Bones; and examining the Offices of the Heart,
and of the other principal Members, $eeking the $eat of the vi-
tal Faculties, noting and ob$erving the admirable $tructures of
the In$truments of the Sen$es, and, without ever making an end
of $atisfying his curio$ity and wonder, contemplating the Re-
ceptacles of the Imagination, of the Memory, and of the Un-
der$tanding; So that which repre$ents it $elf to the meer $ight,
is as nothing in compari$on and proportion to the $trange Won-
ders, that by help of long and accurate Ob$ervations the Wit
of Learned Men di$covereth in Heaven. And this is the $ub-
$tance of what I had to con$ider touching this particular.</P>
<P>In the next place, as to tho$e that adde, That tho$e Natural
Propo$itions of which the Scripture $till $peaks in one con$tant
teno<*>, and which the Fathers all unanimou$ly receive in the
$ame $en$e, ought to be accepted according to the naked and
<foot>literal</foot>
<p n=>445</p>
literal $en$e of the Words, without glo$$es and interpretations;
and received and held for mo$t certain and true; and that con-
$equently the Mobility of the Sun, and Stability of the Earth,
as being $uch, are <I>de Fide</I> to be held for true, and the contrary
opinion to be deemed Heretical: I $hall propo$e to con$idera-
tion, in the fir$t place, That of Natural Propo$itions, $ome there
are, of which all humane Science and Di$cour$e can furni$h us
only with $ome plau$ible opinion, and probable conjecture ra-
ther than with any certain and demon$trative knowledge; as for
example, whether the Stars be animated: Others there are, of
which we have, or may confidently believe that we may have,
by Experiments, long Ob$ervations, and Nece$$ary Demon$tra-
tions an undubitable a$$urance; as for in$tance, whether the
Earth and Heavens move, or not; whether the Heavens are
Spherical, or otherwi$e. As to the fir$t $ort, I doubt not in the
lea$t, that if humane Ratiocinations cannot reach them, and
that con$equently there is no Science to be had of them, but on-
ly an Opinion or Belief, we ought fully and ab$olutely to com-
ply with the meer Verbal Sen$e of the Scripture: But as to the
other Po$itions, I $hould think (as hath been $aid above) That
we are fir$t to a$certain our $elves of the fact it $elf, which will
a$$i$t us in finding out the true $en$es of the Scriptures; which
$hall mo$t certainly be found to accord with the fact demon$tra-
ted, for two truths can never contradict each other. And
this I take to be a Doctrine orthodox and undoubted, for that I
$inde it written in Saint <I>Augu$tine,</I> who $peaking to our point
of the Figure of Heaven, and what it is to be believed to be, in
regard that which A$tronomers affirm concerning it $eemeth to
be, contrary to the Scripture, (they holding it to be rotund,
and the Scripture calling it as it were a ^{*} Curtain, determi-
<marg>* <I>Pelle,</I> a Skin in
the Original, out
in our Bibles a
Curtain.</marg>
neth that we are not at all to regard that the Scripture contra-
dicts A$tronomers; but to believe its Authority, if that which
they $ay $hall be fal$e, and founded, only on the conjectures of
humane infirmity: but if that which which they affirm be pro-
ved by indubitable Rea$ons, this Holy Father doth not $ay,
that the A$tronomers are to be enjoyned, that they them$elves
re$olving and renouncing their Demon$trations do declare their
Conclu$ion to be fal$e, but $aith, that it ought to be de-
mon$trated, That what is $aid in Scripture of a Curtain is not
contrary to their true Demon$trations. The$e are his words:
<marg>(h) <I>Sed ait ali-
quis, quomodo non

<I>(h) But $ome object; How doth it appear, that the $aying in our
Bibles,</I> Who $tretcheth out the Heaven as a Curtain, <I>maketh
not again$t tho$e who maintain the Heavens to be in figure of a
Sphere? Let it be $o, if that be fal$e which they affirme: For
that is truth which is $poke by Divine Authority, rather than</I>
<foot><I>that</I></foot>
<p n=>446</p>
<I>that which proceeds from Humane In$irmity. But if peradven-
ture they $hould be able to prove their Po$ition by $uch Experiments
as puts it out of que$tion, it is to be proved, that what is $aid in
Scripture concerning a Curtain, doth in no wi$e contradict
their manife$t Rea$ons.</I></P>
<P>He proceedeth afterwards to admoni$h us that we ought to be
no le$s careful and ob$ervant in reconciling a Text of Scripture
with a demon$trated Natural Propo$ition, than with another
Text of Scripture which $hould $ound to a contrary Sen$e. Nay
methinks that the circum$pection of this Saint is worthy to be ad-
mired and imitated, who even in ob$cure Conclu$ions, and of
which we may a$$ure our $elves that we can have no knowledge
or Science by humane demon$tration, is very re$erved in deter-
mining what is to be believed, as we $ee by that which he wri-
teth in the end of his $econd Book, <I>de Gene$i ad Litteram,</I> $peak-
ing, whether the Stars are to be believed animate: <I>(i) Which</I>

<I>particular, although (at pre$ent) it cannot ea$ily be comprehended,
yet I $uppo$e in our farther Progre$s of bandling the Scriptures,
we may meet with $ome more pertinent places, upon which it will
be permitted us (if not to determin any thing for certain, yet) to
$ugge$t $omewhat concerning this matter, according to the dictates
of Sacred Authority. But now, the moderation of pious gravity
being alwaies ob$erved, we ought to receive nothing ra$hly in
a doubtful point, lea$t perhaps we reject that out of re$pect to
our Errour, which hereafter Truth may di$cover, to be in no
wi$e repugnant to the Sacred Volumes of the Old and New Te-
$tament.</I></P>
<P>By this and other places (if I deceive not my $elf) the intent
of the Holy Fathers appeareth to be, That in Natural que$tions,
and which are not <I>de Fide,</I> it is fir$t to be con$idered, whether
they be indubitably demon$trated, or by $en$ible Experiments
known; or whether $uch a knowledge and demon$tration is to be
had; which having obtained, and it being the gift of God, it
ought to be applyed to find out the true Sences of the Sacred Pa-
ges in tho$e places, which in appearance might $eem to $peak to
a contrary meaning: Which will unque$tionably be pierced into
by Prudent Divines, together with the occa$ions that moved the
<marg>Id. D Aug. in
Gen. <I>ad Lute-
ram,</I> lib. 1. <I>in fine.</I></marg>
Holy Gho$t, (for our exerci$e, or for $ome other rea$on to me un-
known) to veil it $elf $ometimes under words of different $igni-
fications.</P>
<P>As to the other point, Of our regarding the Primary Scope of
tho$e Sacred Volumes, I cannot think that their having $poken
alwaies in the $ame tenour, doth any thing at all di$turb this
Rule. For if it hath been the Scope of the Scripture by way of
conde$cention to the capacity of the Vulgar at any time, to ex-
<foot>pre$s</foot>
<p n=>447</p>
pre$s a Propo$ition in words, that bear a $en$e different from the
E$$ence of the $aid Propo$ition; why might it not have ob$erved
the $ame, and for the $ame re$pect, as often as it had occa$ion to
$peak of the $ame thing? Nay I conceive, that to have done
otherwi$e, would but have encrea$ed the confu$ion, and dimi-
ni$hed the credit that the$e Sacred Records ought to have a-
mong$t the Common People.</P>
<P>Again, that touching the Re$t and Motion of the Sun and
Earth, it was nece$$ary, for accommodation. to Popular Capa-
city, to a$$ert that which the Litteral $en$e of the Scripture im-
porteth, experience plainly proveth: For that even to our dayes
people far le$s rude, do continue in the $ame Opinion upon Rea-
$ons, that if they were well weighed and examined, would be
found to be extream trivial, and upon Experiments, either whol-
ly fal$e, or altogether be$ides the purpo$e. Nor is it worth
while to go about to remove them from it, they being incapable
of the contrary Rea$ons that depend upon too exqui$ite Ob$er-
vations, and too $ubtil Demon$trations, grounded upon Ab$tra-
ctions, which, for the comprehending of them, require too $trong
an Imagination. Whereupon, although that the Stability of
Heaveu, and Motion of the Earth $hould be more than certain
and demon$trated to the Wi$e; yet neverthele$s it would be
nece$$ary, for the con$ervation of credit among$t the Vulgar, to
affirm the contrary: For that of a thou$and ordinary men, that
come to be que$tioned concerning the$e particulars, its probab e
that there will not be found $o much as one that will not an-
$wer that he thinketh, and $o certainly he doth, that the Sun
moveth, and the Earth $tandeth $till. But yet none ought to
take this common Popular A$$ent to be any Argument of the
truth of that which is affirmed: For if we $hould examine
the$e very men touching the grounds and motives by which they
are induced to believe in that manner; and on the other $ide
$hould hear what Experiments and Demon$trationslper$wade
tho$e few others to believe the contrary, we $hould finde the$e
latter to be moved by mo$t $olid Rea$ons, and the former by
$imple appearances, and vain and ridiculous occurrences. That
therefore it was nece$$ary to a$$ign Motion to the Sun, and Re$t
to the earth, le$t the $hallow capacity of the Vulgar $hould be
confounded, amu$ed, and rendred ob$tinate and contumacious,
in giving credit to the principal Articles, and which are ab$olute-
ly <I>de fide,</I> it is $ufficiently obvious. And if it was nece$$ary $o
to do, it is not at all to be wondred at, that it was with extraor-
dinary Wi$dom $o done, in the Divine Scriptures.</P>
<P>But I will alledge further, That not onely a re$pect to the
Incapacity of the Vulgar, but the current Opinion of tho$e times
<foot>made</foot>
<p n=>448</p>
made the Sacred Writers, in the points that were not nece$$ary
to $alvation, to accommodate them$elves more to the received
u$e, than to the true E$$ence of things: Of which S. <I>Hierom</I>
treating, writeth: <I>(k) As if many things were not $poken in</I>

<I>the Holy Scriptures according to the judgement of tho$e times
in which they were acted, and not according to that which
truth contained.</I> And el$ewhere, the $ame Saint: <I>(l) It is the cu-
$tome for the Pen-men of Scripture, to deliver their Judgments in
many things, according to the common received opinion that their
times had of them.</I> And ^{*} S. <I>Thomas Aquinas</I> in <I>Job</I> upon tho$e
words, <I>Qui extendit Aquilonem $uper vacuum, &amp; appendit</I>

Earth, and which we know, not to be empty, bat filled with Air;
Neverthele$$e, $aith he, The Scripture to comply with the appre-
hen$ion of the Vulgar, who think that in that $ame $pace there
is nothing, calleth it <I>Vacuum</I> and <I>Nihilum.</I> Here the words of
<marg>* D. Thomas, in
cap. 26. Job. v. 7.</marg>
S. <I>Thomas, Quod de $uperiori H&aelig;mi$ph&aelig;rio C&oelig;li nibil nobis ap-
paret, ni$i $patium a&euml;re plenum, quod vulgares homines reputant
Vacnum; loquitur enim $ecundum exi$timationem vulgarium ho-
minum, prout e$t mos in Sacra Scriptura.</I> Now from this Place
I think one may very Logically argue, That the Sacred Scripture
for the $ame re$pect had much more rea$on to phra$e the Sun mo-
veable, and the Earth immoveable. For if we $hould try the ca-
pacity of the Common People, we $hould find them much more
unapt to be per$waded of the $tability of the Sun, and Motion
of the Earth, than that the $pace that environeth it is full of Air.
Therefore if the $acred Authors, in this point, which had not $o
much difficulty to be beat into the capacity of the Vulgar, have
notwith$tanding forborn to attempt per$wading them unto it, it
mu$t needs $eem very rea$onable that in other Propo$itions much
more ab$tru$e they have ob$erved the $ame $tile. Nay <I>Copernicus</I>
him$elf, knowing what power an antiquated cu$tome and way
of conceiving things become familiar to us from our infancy
hath in our Fancy, that he might not increa$e confu$ion and dif-
ficulty in our apprehen$ions, after he had fir$t demon$trated,
That the Motions which appear to us to belong to the Sun, or to
the Firmament, are really in the Earth; in proceeding after-
wards to reduce rhem into Tables, and to apply them to u$e, he
calleth them the Motions of the Sun, and of the Heaven that is
above the Planets; expre$ly terming them the Ri$ing and Set-
ting of the Sun and Stars; and mutations in the obliquity of
the Zodiack, and variations in the points of the Equinoxes, the
Middle Motion, <I>Anomalia, Pro$thaph&aelig;re$is</I> of the Sun; and $uch
other things; which do in reality belong to the Earth: But be-
<foot>cau$e</foot>
<p n=>449</p>
cau$e being joyned to it, and con$equently having a $hare in eve-
ry of its motions, we cannot immediately di$cern them in her, but
are forced to refer them to the Cele$tial Bodies in which they
appear; therefore we call them as if they were made there, where
they $eem to us to be made. Whence it is to be noted how ne-
ne$$ary it is to accommodate our di$cour$e to our old and accu-
$tomed manner of under$tanding.</P>
<P>That, in the next place, the common con$ent of Fathers, in re-
ceiving a Natural Propo$ition of Scripture, all in the $ame $en$e
ought to Authorize it $o far, as to make it become a matter of
Faith to believe it to be ^{*} $o, I $hould think that it ought at mo$t
<marg>* Namely, ac-
cording to the Lit-
teral Sen$e.</marg>
to be under$tood of tho$e Conclu$ions onely, which have beenby
the $aid Fathers di$cu$$ed, and $ifted with all po$$ible diligence,
and debated on the one $ide, and on the other, and all things in
the end concurring to di$prove the one, and prove the other. But
the Mobility of the Earth, and Stability of the Sun, are not of
this kinde; For, that the $aid Opinion was in tho$e times total-
ly buried, and never brought among$t the Que$tions of the Schools,
and not con$idered, much le$s followed by any one: So that it is to
be believed that it never $o much as entered into the thought of
the Fathers to di$pute it, the Places of Scripture, their own Opinion,
and the a$$ent of men having all concurred in the $ame judgement,
without the contradiction of any one, $o far as we can finde.</P>
<P>Be$ides, it is not enough to $ay that the Fathers all admit the
$tability of the Earth, &amp;c. Therefore to believe it is a matter of
Faith: But its nece$$ary to prove that they have condemned the
contrary Opinion: For I may affirm and bide by this, That their
not having occa$ion to make $atisfaction upon the $ame, and to
di$cu$s it, hath made them to omit and admit it, onely as cur-
rent, but not as re$olved and proved And I think I have very
good Rea$on for what I $ay; For either the Fathers did make
reflection upon this Conclu$ion as controverted, or not: If not,
then they could determin nothing concerning it no not in their
private thoughts; and their incogitance doth not oblige us to
receive tho$e Precepts which they have not, $o much as in their
intentions enjoyned. But if they did reflect and con$ider there-
on, they would long $ince have condemned it, if they had judged
it erroneous; which we do not find that they have done. Nay, after
that $ome Divines have began to con$ider it, we find that they
have not deem'd it erroneous; as we read in the Commentaries of
<I>Didacus a Stunica</I> upon <I>Job,</I> in <I>Cap. 9, v. 6.</I> on the words, <I>Qui com-
movet Terram de loco $uo,</I> &amp;c. Where he at large di$cour$eth upon
the <I>Copernican</I> Hypothe$is, and concludeth, <I>That the Mobility
of the Earth, is not contrary to Scripture.</I></P>
<P>Withal, I may ju$tly que$tion the truth of that determination,
namely, That the Church enjoyneth us to hold $uch like Natural
<foot>Lll Con-</foot>
<p n=>450</p>
Conclu$ions as matters of Faith, onely becau$e they bear the
$tamp of an unanimous Interpretation of all the Fathers: And
I do $uppo$e that it may po$$ibly be, that tho$e who hold in this
manner, might po$$ibly have gone about in favour of their own
Opinion, to have amplified the Decretal of the Councils; which
I cannot finde in this ca$e to prohibit any other, $ave onely, <I>Per-
verting to Sen$es contrary to that of Holy Church, or of the
concurrent con$ent of Fathers, tho$e places, and tho$e onely that
do pertain either to Faith or Manners, or concern our edification
in the Doctrine of Chri$tianity: And thus $peaks the Council of
Trent. Se$$.</I> 4. But the Mobility or Stability of the Earth, or
<marg><I>Concil. Trid. Se$$.</I>
4.</marg>
of the Sun, are not matters of Faith, nor contrary to Manners,
nor is there any one, that for the $tabli$hing of this Opinion,
will pervert places of Scripture in oppo$ition to the Holy Church,
or to the Fathers: Nay, Tho$e who have writ of this Doctrine,
did never make u$e of Texts of Scripture; that they might leave
it $till in the brea$ts of Grave and Prudent Divines to interpret
the $aid Places, according to their true meaning.</P>
<P>And how far the Decrees of Councills do comply with the Ho-
ly Fathers in the$e particulars, may be $ufficiently manife$t, in
that they are $o far from enjoyning to receive $uch like Natural
Conclu$ions for matters of Faith, or from cen$uring the contrary
Opinions as erronious; that rather re$pecting the Primitive and
primary intention of the Holy Church, they do adjudge it un-
profitable to be bu$ied in examining the truth thereof. Let
your Highne$s be plea$ed to hear once again what S. <I>Augu$tine</I>

<P>But yet although in Natural Propo$itions we were to take the
re$olution of condemning or admitting them from Texts of Scri-
pture unanimou$ly expounded in the $ame Sen$e by all the Fa-
thers, yet do I not $ee how this Rule can hold in our Ca$e; for that

So for the Miracle in the time of <I>Hezekiah, Paulus Burgen$is</I> is of

But that, in $hort, it is nece$$ary to Glo$$e and Interpret the
words of the Text in <I>Jo$hua,</I> when ever the Worlds Sy$teme
<marg>I$a<*> Cap. 38.</marg>
is in di$pute, I $hall $hew anon. Now finally, granting to the$e
Gentlemen more than they demand, to wit, That we are whol-
ly to acquie$ce in the judgment of Judicious Divines, and that
in regard that $uch a particular Di$qui$ition is not found to
have been made by the Ancient Fathers, it may be undertaken
by the Sages of our Age, who having fir$t heard the Experiments,
Ob$ervations, Rea$ons, and Demon$trations of Philolophers and
Aftronomers, on the one $ide, and on the other ($eeing that the
Controver$ie is about Natural Problems, and Nece$$ary <I>Dilem-
ma's,</I> and which cannot po$$ibly be otherwi$e than in one of
the two manners in controver$ie) they may with competent cer-
tainty determine what Divine In$pirations $hall dictate to them.
But that without minutely examining and di$cu$$ing all the Rea-
$ons on both $ides; and without ever comming to any certainty
of the truth of the Ca$e, $nch a Re$olution $hould be taken, Is
not to be hoped from tho$e who do not $tick to hazzard the Ma-
je$ty and Dignity of the Sacred Scripture, in defending the re-
putation of their vain Fancies; Nor to be feared from tho$e
who make it their whole bu$ine$$e, to examine with all in-
ten$ne$s, what the Grounds of this Doctrine are; and that only
in an Holy Zeal for Truth, the Sacred Scriptures, and for the
Maje$ty, Dignity, and Authority, in which every Chri$tian
$hould indeavour to have them maintained. Which Dignity,
who $eeth not that it is with greater Zeal de$ired and procured
by tho$e who, ab$olutely $ubmitting them$elves to the Holy
Church, de$ire, not that this, or that opinion may be prohibi-
ted, but onely that $uch things may be propo$ed to con$idera-
tion, as may the more a$certain her in the $afe$t choice, than by
tho$e who being blinded by their particular Intere$t, or $timula-
ted by malitious $ugge$tions, preach that $he $hould, without
more ado, thunder out Cur$es, for that $he had power $o to do:
Not con$idering that all that may be done is not alwayes conve-
nient to be done. The Holy Fathers of old were not of this
opinion, but rather knowing of how great prejudice, and how
much again$t the primary intent of the Catholick Church, it
would be to go about from Texts of Scripture to decide Natu-
ral Conclu$ions, touching which, either Experiments or nece$$ary
Demon$trations, might in time to come evince the contrary, of
that which the naked $en$e of the Words $oundeth, they have

with it: and $o $hew that we contend not for the $en$e of Divine
Scriptures, but our own, in that we would have that which is

be di$proved by mo$t certain Truth, which if it $hould $o be, the Holy
Scripture affirm'd it not, but Humane Ignorance $uppo$ed it.</I>
Whereby we $ee that the $en$es which we impo$e on Texts of
Scripture, would be fal$e, when ever they $hould di$agree with
Truths demon$trated. And therefore we ought, by help of de-
mon$trated Truth, to $eek the undoubted $en$e of Scripture:
and not according to the $ound of the words, that may $eem
true to our weakne$$e, to go about, as it were, to force Na-

<P>Let Your Highne$$e be plea$ed to ob$erve farther, with how
great circum$pection this Holy Man proceedeth, before he af-
firmeth any Interpretation of Scripture to be $ure, and in $uch

Rule, by $hewing us to what perils tho$e men expo$e the Scri-
ptures, and the Church; who, more re$pecting the $upport of
their own errours, than the Scriptures Dignity, would $tretch its
Authority beyond the Bounds which it pre$cribeth to it $elf, he
$ubjoyns the en$uing words, which of them$elves alone might
$uffice to repre$s and moderate the exce$$ive liberty, which $ome
think that they may a$$ume to them$elves: <I>(u) For it many
times falls out, that a Chri$tian may not $o fully under$tand a
Point concerning the Earth, lieaven, and the re$t of this Worlds
Elements; the Motion, Conver$ion, Magnitude, and Di$tances of
the Stars, the certain defects of the Sun and Moon, the Revoluti-
ons of Years and Times, the Nature of Animals, Fruits, Stones,
and other things of like nature, as to defend the $ame by right
Rea$on, or make it out by Experiments. But its too great an ab-
$urdity, yea mo$t pernicious, and chiefly to be avoided, to let an
Infidel finde a Chri$tian $o $tupid, that he $hould argue the$e mat-
ters; as if they were according to Chri$tian Doctrine; and make
him (as the Proverb $aith) $carce able to contain his laughter, $ee-
ing him $o far from the Mark Nor is the matter $o much that one
in an errour $hould be laught at, but that our Authors $hould be
thought by them that are without, to be of the $ame Opinion, and to
the great prejudice of tho$e, who$e $alvation we wait for, $en$urcd
and rejected as unlearned. For when they $hal confute any one of the
Chri$tians in that matter, which they them$elvs thorowly under-
$tand, and $hall thereupon expre$s their light e$teem of our Books;
how $hall the$e Volumes be believed touching the Re$urrection of
the Dead, the Hope of eternal Life, and the Kingdom of Heaven;
when, as to the$e Points which admit of pre$ent Demon$tration,
or undoubted Rea$ons, they conceive them to be fal$ly written.</I></P>
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>454</p>
<P>And how much the truly Wi$e and Prudent Fathers are di$-
plea$ed with the$e men, who in defence of Propo$itions which
they do not under$tand, do apply, and in a certain $en$e pawn
Texts of Scripture, and afterwards go on to encrea$e their fir$t
Errour, by producing other places le$s under$tood than the for-
mer. The $ame Saint declareth in the expre$$ions following:

<I>(x) What trouble and $orrow weak undertakers bring upon
their knowing Brethren, is not to be expre$$ed; $ince when they
begin to be told and convinced of their fal$e and un$ound Opinion,
by tho$e who have no re$pect for the Authority of our Scriptures,
in defence of what through a fond Temerity, and mo$t manife$t fal-
$ity, they have urged; they fall to citing the $aid Sacred Books
for proof of it, or el$e repeat many words by heart out of them,
which they conceive to make for their purpo$e; not knowing
either what they $ay, or whereof they affirm.</I></P>
<P>In the number of the$e we may, as I conceive, account tho$e,
who, being either unwilling or unable to under$tand the De-
mon$trations and Experiments, wherewith the Author and fol-
lowers of this Opinion do confirm it, run upon all occa$ions to
the Scriptures, not con$idering that the more they cite them, and
the more they per$i$t in affirming that they are very clear, and
do admit no other $en$es, $ave tho$e which they force upon
them, the greater injury they do to the Dignity of them (if we
allowed that their judgments were of any great Authority) in
ca$e that the Truth coming to be manife$tly known to the con-
trary, $hould occa$ion any confu$ion, at lea$t to tho$e who are
$eparated from the Holy Church; of whom yet $he is very $olici-
tous, and like a tender Mother, de$irous to recover them again
into her Lap. Your Highne$s therefore may $ee how pr&aelig;po$terou$-
ly tho$e Per$ons proceed, who in Natural Di$putations do range
Texts of Scripture in the Front for their Arguments; and $uch
Texts too many times, as are but $uperficially under$tood by them.</P>
<P>But if the$e men do verily think, &amp; ab$olutely believe that they
have the true $ence of Such a particular place of Scripture, it mu$t
needs follow of con$equence, that they do likewi$e hold for certain,
that they have found the ab$olute truth of that Natural Conclu$i-
on, which they intend to di$pute<*> And that withall, they do know
that they have a great advantage of their Adver$ary, who$e Lot it
is to defend the part that is fal$e; in regard that he who maintain-
eth the Truth, may have many $en$ible experiments, and many ne-
ce$$ary Demon$trations on his $ide; whereas his Antagoni$t can
make u$e of no other than deceitful appearances, <I>Paralogi$ms</I> and
<I>Sophi$ms.</I> Now if they keeping within natural bounds, &amp; produ-
cing no other Weapons but tho$e of Philo$ophy, pretend however,
to have $o much advantage of their Enemy; why do they after-
<foot>wards</foot>
<p n=>455</p>
wards in coming to engage, pre$ently betake them$elves to a Wea-
pon inevitable &amp; dreadful to terrifie their Opponent with the $ole
beholding of it? But if I may $peak the truth, I believe that they are
the fir$t that are affrighted, and that perceiving them$elves unable
to bear up again$t the a$$aults of their Adver$ary, go about to find
out ways how to keep them far enough off, forbidding unto them
the u$e of the Rea$on which the Divine Bounty had vouch$afed
them, &amp; abu$ing the mo$t equitable Authority of $acred Scripture,
which rightly under$tood and applyed, can never, according to
the common Maxime of Divines, oppo$e the Manife$t Experi-
ments, or Nece$$ary Demon$trations. But the$e mens running
to the Scriptures for a Cloak to their inability to comprehend,
not to $ay re$olve the Rea$ons alledged again$t them, ought (if I
be not mi$taken) to $tand them in no $tead: the Opinion which
they oppo$e having never as yet been condemned by Holy
Church. So that if they would proceed with Candor, they
$hould either by $ilence confe$s them$elves unable to handle $uch
like points, or fir$t con$ider that it is not in the power of them or
others, but onely in that of the Pope, and of Sacred Councils to
<marg>If this pa$$age

member that I do

cen$ure a Po$ition to be Erroneous: But that it is left to their
freedome to di$pute concerning its fal$ity. And thereupon,
knowing that it is impo$$ible that a Propo$ition $hould at the
$ame time be True and Heretical; they ought, I $ay, to imploy
them$elves in that work which is mo$t poper to them, namely,
in demon$trating the fal$ity thereof: whereby they may $ee
how needle$$e the prohibiting of it is, its fal$hood being once
di$covered, for that none would follow it: or the Prohibition
would be $afe, and without all danger of Scandal. Therefore
fir$t let the$e men apply them$elves to examine the Arguments
of <I>Copernicus</I> and others; and leave the condemning of them
for Erroneous and Heretical to whom it belongeth: But yet let
them not hope ever to finde $uch ra$h and precipitous Determina-
tions in the Wary and Holy Fathers, or in the ab$olute Wi$-
dome of him that cannot erre, as tho$e into which they $uffer
them$elves to be hurried by $ome particular Affection or Inte-
re$t of their own. In the$e and $uch other Po$itions, which are
not directly <I>de Fide,</I> certainly no man doubts but His Holine$s
hath alwayes an ab$olute power of Admitting or Condemn-
ing them, but it is not in the power of any Creature to make
them to be true or fal$e, otherwi$e than of their own nature,
and <I>de facto</I> they are.</P>
<P>Therefore it is in my judgment more di$cretion to a$$ure us
fir$t of the nece$$ary and immutable Truth of the Fact, (over
which none hath power) than without that certainty by condem-
ning one part to deprive ones $elf of that authority of freedome
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>456</p>
to elect, making tho$e Determinations to become nece$$ary,
which at pre$ent are indifferent and arbitrary, and re$t in the
will of Supreme Authority. And in a word, if it be not po$-
$ible that a Conclu$ion $hould be declared Heretical, whil$t we
are not certain, but that it may be true, their pains are in vain
who pretend to condemn the Mobility of the Earth and Stabili-
ty of the Sun, unle$$e they have fir$t demon$trated it to be im-
po$$ible and fal$e.</P>
<P>It remaineth now, that we con$ider whether it be true, that
the Place in <I>Jo$huab</I> may be taken without altering the pure $ig-
nification of the words: and how it can be that the Sun, obey-
ing the command of <I>Jo$huah,</I> which was, <I>That it $hould $tand
$till,</I> the day might thereupon be much lengthened. Which bu-
$ine$$e, if the Cele$tial Motions be taken according to the <I>Ptolo-
maick</I> Sy$teme, can never any wayes happen, for that the Sun
moving thorow the Ecliptick, according to the order of the
Signes, which is from Ea$t to We$t (which is that which maketh
Day and Night) it is a thing manife$t, that the Sun cea$ing its
true and proper Motion, the day would become $horter and not
longer; and that on the contrary, the way to lengthen it would
be to ha$ten and velocitate the Suns motion; in$omuch that to
cau$e the Sun to $tay above the Horizon for $ome time, in one
and the $ame place, without declining towards the We$t, it would
be nece$$ary to accelerate its motion in $uch a manner as that it
might $eem equal to that of the <I>Primum Mobile,</I> which would be
an accelerating it about three hundred and $ixty times more than
ordinary. If therefore <I>Jo$huah</I> had had an intention that his
words $hould be taken in their pure and proper $ignification, he
would have bid the Sun to have accelerated its Motion $o, that
the Rapture of the <I>Primum Mobile</I> might not carry it to the
We$t: but becau$e his words were heard by people which hap-
ly knew no other Cele$tial Motion, $ave th<*> grand and common
one, from Ea$t to We$t, $tooping to their Capacity, and having
no intention to teach them the Con$titution of the Spheres, but
only that they $hould perceive the greatne$s of the Miracle
wrought, in the lengthening of the Day, he $poke according to
their apprehen$ion. Po$$ibly this Con$ideration moved <I>Diony-
$ius Areopagita</I> to $ay that in this Miracle the <I>Primum Mobile</I>
$tood $till, and this $topping, all the Cele$tial Spheres did of
con$equence $tay: of which opinion is S. <I>Augu$tine</I> him$elf, and
<I>Abulen$is</I> at large confirmeth it. Yea, that <I>Jo$hua's</I> intention
was, that the whole Sy$teme of the Cele$tial Spheres $hould
$tand $till, is collected from the command he gave at the $ame
time to the Moon, although that it had nothing to do in the
lengthening of the day; and under the injunction laid upon the
<foot>Moon,</foot>
<p n=>457</p>
Moon, we are to under$tand the Orbes of all the other Planets,
pa$$ed over in $ilence here, as al$o in all other places of the Sacred
Scriptures; the intention of which, was not to reach us the A$tro-
nomical Sciences. I $uppo$e therefore, (if I be not deceived)
that it is very plain, that if we allow the <I>Ptolemaick</I> Sy$teme, we
mu$t of nece$$ity interpret the words to $ome $en$e different from
their $trict $ignification. Which Interpretation (being admo-
ni$hed by the mo$t u$efull precepts of S. <I>Augu$tine)</I> I will not
affirm to be of nece$$ity this above-mentioned, $ince that $ome
other man may haply think of $ome other more proper, and more
agreeable Sen$e.</P>
<P>But now, if this $ame pa$$age may be under$tood in the <I>Coper-
nican</I> Sy$teme, to agree better with what we read in <I>Jo$huah,</I>
with the help of another Ob$ervation by me newly $hewen in
the Body of the Sun; I will propound it to con$ideration, $peak-
ing alwaies with tho$e $afe Re$erves; That I am not $o affectio-
nate to my own inventions, as to prefer them before tho$e of
other men, and to believe that better and more agreeable to the
intention of the Sacred Volumes cannot be produced.</P>
<P>Suppo$ing therefore in the fir$t place, that in the Miracle of
<I>Jo$huah,</I> the whole Sy$teme of the Cele$tial Revolutions $tood
$till, according to the judgment of the afore-named Authors:
And this is the rather to be admitted, to the end, that by the
$taying of one alone, all the Con$titutions might not be con-
founded, and a great di$order needle$ly introduced in the whole
cour$e of Nature: I come in the $econd place to con$ider how the
Solar Body, although $table in one con$tant place, doth neverthe-
le$s revolve in it $elf, making an entire Conver$ion in the $pace
of a Month, or thereabouts; as I conceive I have $olidly demon-
$trated in my Letters <I>Delle Machie Solari</I>: Which motion we
$en$ibly $ee to be in the upper part of its Globe, inclined to-
wards the South; and thence towards the lower part, to encline
towards the North, ju$t in the $ame manner as all the other Orbs
of the Planets do. Thirdly, If we re$pect the Nobility of the
Sun, and his being the Fountain of Light, by which, (as I nece$-
$arily demon$trate) not onely the Moon and Earth, but all the
other Planets (all in the $ame manner dark of them$elves) become
illuminated; I conceive that it will be no unlogicall Illation to $ay,
That it, as the Grand Mini$ter of Nature, and in a certain $en$e
the Soul and Heart of the World, infu$eth into the other Bodies
which environ it; not onely Light, but Motion al$o; by revol-
ving ^{*} in it $elf: So that in the $ame manner that the motion of
<marg>* <I>i. i.</I> On its own
Axis.</marg>
the Heart of an Animal cea$ing, all the other motions of its
Members would cea$e; $o, the Conver$ion of the Sun cea$ing,
the Conver$ions of all the Planets would $tand $till. And though
<foot>Mmm I</foot>
<p n=>458</p>
I could produce the te$timonies of many grave Writers to prove
the admirable power and influence of the Sun, I will content my
$elf with one $ole place of Holy <I>Dioni$ius Areopagita</I> in his Book
<marg>(*) <I>Lux ejus colli-
git, convertitque ad

are pre$erved by his $plendor: Wherefore the Sun is called</I> <G>Hli<*>,</G>
<I>for that he collecteth and gathereth together all things di$per$ed.</I>
And a little after of the Sun again he adds; ^{(*)} <I>If this Sun which

which fall within our Sen$e, being very many and different; yet
if he who is one, and equally be$towes his Light, doth renew,

taker of one and the $ame Sun; and the cau$es of many things
which participate of him, are equally auticipated in him: Certain-
ly by greater rea$on</I>; &amp;c. The Sun therefore being the Foun-
tain of Light and, Principle of Motion, God intending, that at
the Command of <I>Jo$hua,</I> all the Worlds Sy$teme, $hould con-
tinue many hours in the $ame $tate, it $ufficeth to make the Sun
$tand $till, upon who$e $tay (all the other Conver$ions cea$ing)
the Earth, the Moon, the Sun did abide in the $ame Con$titution
as before, as likewi$e all the other Planets: Nor in all that time
did the Day decline towards Night, but it was miraculou$ly pro-
longed: And in this manner, upon the $tanding $till of the Sun,
without altering, or in the lea$t di$turbing the other A$pects and
mutual Po$itions of the Stars, the Day might be lengthned on
Earth; which exactly agreeth with the Litteral $en$e of the Sacred
Text.</P>
<P>But that of which, if I be not mi$taken, we are to make no
$mall account, is, That by help of this <I>Copernican</I> Hypothe$is,
we have the Litteral, apert, and Natural Sen$e of another parti-
cular that we read of in the $ame Miracle; which is, That the
Sun $tood $till <I>in Medio C&aelig;li</I>: Upon which pa$$age grave Divines
rai$e many que$tions, in regard it $eemeth very probable, That
when <I>Jo$huah</I> de$ired the lengthning of the Day, the Sun was
near $etting, and not in the Meridian; for if it had been in the
Meridian, it being then about the Summer <I>Sol$tice,</I> and con-
$equently the dayes being at the longe$t, it doth not $eem likely
that it was nece$$ary to pray for the lengthning of the day, to
pro$ecute Victory in a Battail, the $pace of $even hours and more,
which remained to Night, being $ufficient for that purpo$e.
Upon which Grave Divines have been induced to think that the
Sun was near $etting: And $o the words them$elves $eem to
<foot>$ound</foot>
<p n=>459</p>
$ound, $aying, <I>Ne movearis Sol, ne movearis.</I> For if it had
been in the Meridian, either it had been needle$s to have asked
a Miracle, or it would have been $ufficient to have onely praid
for $ome retardment. Of this opinion is <I>Cajetan,</I> to which $ub-
$cribeth <I>Magaglianes,</I> confirming it by $aying, that <I>Jo$hua</I> had
that very day done $o many other things before his commanding
the Sun, as were not po$$ibly to be di$patch't in half a day.
Whereupon they are forced to read the Words <I>in Medio C&oelig;li</I>
(to confe$s the truth) with a little har$hne$s, $aying that they
import no more than this: <I>That the Sun $tood $till, being in our
Hemi$phere, that is, above the Horizon.</I> But (if I do not erre)
<marg><I>Solem $teti$$e,
dum adhuc in He-
mi$pharto no$tro,
$upra $cilicet Ho-
rizontem exi$teret.</I>
Cajetan <I>in loce.</I></marg>
we $hall avoid that and all other har$h expo$itions, if according
to the <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teme we place the Sun in the mid$t, that
is, in the Centre of the C&oelig;le$tial Orbes, and of the Planetary
Conver$ions, as it is mo$t requi$ite to do. For $uppo$ing any
hour of the day (either Noon, or any other, as you $hall plea$e
neerer to the Evening) the Day was lengthened, and all the
C&oelig;le$tial Revolutions $tayed by the Suns $tanding $till, <I>In the
mid$t,</I> that is, <I>in the Centre of Heaven,</I> where it re$ides: A
Sen$e $o much the more accomodate to the Letter (be$ides what
hath been $aid already) in that, if the Text had de$ired to have
affirmed the Suns Re$t to have been cau$ed at Noon-day, the
proper expre$$ion of it had been to $ay, <I>It $tood $till at Noon-day,</I>
or <I>in the Meridian Circle,</I> and not <I>in the mid$t of Heaven</I>: In
regard that the true and only <I>Middle</I> of a Spherical Body (as is
Heaven) is the Centre.</P>
<P>Again, as to other places of Scripture, which $eem contrary to
this po$ition, I do not doubt but that if it were acknowledged
for True and Demon$trated tho$e very Divines who $o long as
they repute it fal$e, hold tho$e places incapable of Expo$itions
that agree with it would finde $uch Interpretations for them, as
$hould very well $uit therewith; and e$pecially if to the know-
ledge of Divine Learning they would but adde $ome knowledge
of the A$tronomical Sciences: And as at pre$ent, whil$t they
deem it fal$e they think they meet in Scripture only with $uch
places as make again$t it, if they $hall but once have entertained
another conceipt thereof, they would meet peradventure as many
others that accord with it, and haply would judge, that the Holy
Church doth very appo$itly teach, That God placed the Sun in
the Centre of Heaven, and that thereupon by revolving it in it
$elf, after the manner of a Wheel, He contributed the ordinary
Cour$es to the Moon and other Erratick Stars, whil$t that $he

ABSTRACT
OF THE
Learned Treati$e
OF
JOHANNIS KEPL<I>E</I>RUS,
The Emperours <I>Mathematician</I>:
ENTITULED
<I>His Introduction upon</I> MARS:</head>
<P>It mu$t be confe$$ed, that there are very
many who are devoted to Holine$$e,
that di$$ent from the Judgment of <I>Co-
pernicus,</I> fearing to give the Lye to the
Holy Gho$t $peaking in the Scriptures,
if they $hould $ay, that the Earth mo-
veth, and the Sun $tands $till. But let
$uch con$ider, that $ince we judge of ve-
ry many, and tho$e the mo$t principal
things by the Sen$e of Seeing, it is impo$$ible that we $hould ali-
enate our Speech from this Sen$e of our Eyes. Therefore many
things daily occur, of which we $peak according to the Sen$e of
Sight, when as we certainly know that the things them$elves are
otherwi$e. An Example whereof we have in that Ver$e of
<I>Virgil</I>;</P>
<head><I>Provehimur portu, Terr&oelig;que urbe$que recedunt.</I></head>
<P>So when we come forth of the narrow $traight of $ome Val-
ley, we $ay that a large Field di$covereth it $elf. So Chri$t to
<I>Peter, Duc in altum</I>; [Lanch forth into the Deep, or on high,]
as if the Sea were higher than its Shores; For $o it $eemeth to
the Eye, but the Opticks $hew the cau$e of this fallacy. Yet
Chri$t u$eth the mo$t received Speech, although it proceed from
this delu$ion of the Eyes. Thus we conceive of the Ri$ing and
<foot>Setting</foot>
<p n=>462</p>
Setting of the Stars, that is to $ay, of their A$cen$ion and De$-
cen$ion; when at the $ame time that we affirm the Sun ri$eth, o-
thers $ay, that it goeth down. See my <I>Optices A$tronomi&oelig;, cap.</I>
10. <I>fol.</I> 327 So in like manner, the <I>Ptolomaicks</I> affirm, that the
Planets <I>$tand $till,</I> when for $ome dayes together they $eem to be
fixed, although they believe them at that very time to be moved
in a direct line, either downwards to, or upwards from the
Earth. Thus the Writers of all Nations u$e the word <I>Sol$titi-
um,</I> and yet they deny that the Sun doth really $tand $till. Like-
wi$e there will never any man be $o devoted to <I>Copernicus,</I> but
he will $ay, the Sun entereth into <I>Cancer</I> and <I>Leo,</I> although he
granteth that the Earth enters <I>Capricorn</I> or <I>Aquarius</I>: And $o
in other ca$es of the like nature. But now the Sacred Scriptures,
$peaking to men of vulgar matters (in which they were not in-
tended to in$truct men) after the manner of men, that $o they
might be under$tood by men, do u$e $uch Expre$$ions as are
granted by all, thereby to in$inuate other things more My$terious
and Divine. What wonder is it then, if the Scripture $peaks
according to mans apprehen$ion, at $uch time when the Truth
of things doth di$$ent from the Conception that all men, whe-
ther Learned or Unlearned have of them? Who knows not
that it is a Poetical allu$ion, <I>P$al.</I> 19. where, whil$t under the $i-
militude of the Sun, the Cour$e of the Go$pel, as al$o the Pere-
grination of our Lord Chri$t in this World, undertaken for our
$akes, is de$cribed, <I>The Sun</I> is $aid <I>to come forth of his Taberna-
cle</I> of the Horizon, <I>as a Bridegroom out of his Chamber, re-
joycing as a Giant to run a Race</I>? Which <I>Virgil</I> thus imitates;</P>
<head><I>Tithono croceum linquens Auror a cubile</I>:</head>
<P>For the fir$t Poets were among$t the Jews. The P$almi$t knew that
the Sun went not forth of the Horizon, as out of its Tabernacle,
&amp; yet it $eemeth to the Eye $o to do: Nor did he believe, that the
Sun moved, for that it appeared to his $ight $o to do. And yet he
$aith both, for that both were $o to his $eeming. Neither is it
to be adjudged fal$e in either Sen$e: for the perception of the
Eyes hath its verity, fit for the more $ecret purpo$e of the P$al-
mi$t in $hadowing forth the current pa$$age o$ the Go$pel, as
al$o the Peregrination of the Son of God. <I>Jo$hua</I> likewi$e
mentioneth the Vallies on or in, which the Sun and Moon mo-
ved, for that they appeared to him at <I>Jordan</I> $o to do: And yet
both the$e Pen-men may obtain their ends. <I>David,</I> (and with
him <I>Syracides</I>) the magnificence of God being made known,
which cau$ed the$e things to be in this manner repre$ented to
$ight, or otherwi$e, the my$tical meaning, by means of the$e
Vi$ibles being di$cerned: And <I>Jo$hua,</I> in that the Sun, as to his
<foot>Sen$e</foot>
<p n=>463</p>
Sen$e of Seeing, $taid a whole day in the mid$t of Heaven, where-
as at the $ame time to others it lay hid under the Earth. But in-
cogitant per$ons onely look upon the contrariety of the words,
<I>The Sun $tood $till,</I> that is, <I>The Earth $tood $till</I>; not con$idering
that this contradiction is confined within the limits of the Op-
ticks and A$tronomy: For which cau$e it is not outwardly ex-
po$ed to the notice and u$e of men: Nor will they under$tand
that the onely thing <I>Jo$huah</I> prayed for, was that the Mountains
might not intercept the Sun from him; which reque$t he expre$-
$ed in words, that $uited with his Ocular Sen$e: Be$ides it had
been very un$ea$onable at that time to think of A$tronomy, or
the Errours in Sight; for if any one $hould have told him that
the Sun could not really move upon the Valley of <I>Ajalon,</I>, but
onely in relation to Sen$e, would not <I>Jo$huah</I> have replyed, that
his de$ire was that the day might be prolonged, $o it were by
any means what$oever? In like manner would he have an$wered
if any one had $tarted a que$tion about the Suns Mobility, and
the Earths Motion. But God ea$ily under$tood by <I>Jo$huahs</I>
words what he asked for, and by arre$ting the Earths Motion,
made the Sun in his apprehen$ion $eem to $tand $till. For the
$umm of <I>Jo$huahs</I> Prayer amounts to no more but this, that it
might thus appear to him, let it in the mean time <I>be what it
would</I> of it $elf. For that its $o $eeming, was not in vain and
ridiculous, but accompanied with the de$ired effect. But read
the tenth <I>Chap.</I> of my <I>Book,</I> that treats of <I>the Optick part of A-
$tronomy,</I> where thou $halt finde the Rea$ons why the Sun doth
in this manner $eem to all mens thinking to be moved, and not
the Earth; as namely, becau$e the Sun appeareth $mall; and the
Earth bigg. Again, the Motion of the Sun is not di$cerned by
the eye, by rea$on of his $eeming tardity, but by ratiocina-
tion onely; in that after $ome time it varieth not its proximity to
$uch and $uch Mountains. Therefore it is impo$$ible that Rea-
$on, unle$s it be fir$t in$tructed, $hould frame to it $elf any other
apprehen$ion, than that the Earth with Heavens Arch placed
over it, is as it were a great Hou$e, in which, being immoveable,
the Sun like a Bird flying in the Air, pa$$eth in $o $mall a Species
out of one Climate into another. Which imagination of all
Man-kinde being thus, gave the fir$t line in the Sacred Leaves:
^{*} <I>In the beginning</I> ($aith <I>Mo$es) God created the Heaven and the
<marg>* Gen. <I>Chv. 1.
v.</I> 1.</marg>
Earth</I>; for that the$e two are mo$t obvious to the eye. As if
<I>Mo$es</I> $hould have $aid thus to Man; This whole Mundane Fa-
brick which thou $ee$t, lucid above, and dark, and of a va$t ex-
tent beneath, wherein thou ha$t thy being, and with which thou
art covered, was created by God.</P>
<P>In another place Man is que$tioned; <I>Whether he can finde out</I>
<foot><I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>464</p>
<I>the height of Heaven above, or depth of the Earth beneath</I>: for
that each of them appeareth to men of ordinary capacity, to have
equally an infinite extent. And yet no man that is in his right
mind will by the$e words circum$cribe and bound the diligence
of A$tronomers, whether in demon$trating the mo$t contemptible
Minuity of the Earth, in compari$on of Heaven, or in $earching
out A$tronomical <I>Di$tances</I>: Since tho$e words $peak not of the
Rational, but real Dimention; which to a Humane Body,
whil$t confin'd to the Earth, and breathing in the open Air, is al-
together impo$$ible. Read the whole 38. Chapter of <I>Job,</I> and
compare it with tho$e Points which are di$puted in A$tronomy,
<marg>* P$al. 24. 2.</marg>
and Phy$iologie. If any one do alledge from <I>P$al.</I> 24. That ^{*} <I>The
Earth is founded upon the Seas,</I> to the end that he may thence
infer $ome new Principle in Philo$ophy, ab$urd to hear; as, That
the Earth doth float upon the Waters; may it not truly be told
him, That he ought not to meddle with the Holy Spirit, nor to
bring him with contempt into the School of Phy$iologie.
For the P$almi$t in that place means nothing el$e but
that which men fore-know, and daily $ee by experience; namely,
That the Earth (being lifted up after the $eparation of the Wa-
ters) doth $wim between the Grand Oceans, and float about the

<P>If any one receive this Reading without $cruple, why not the
other; that $o in tho$e $ame Texts which are wont to be alledged
again$t the Motion of the Earth, we may in like manner turn our
eyes from Natural Philo$ophy, to the $cope and intent of Scri-
pture. <I>One Generation pa$$eth away,</I> ($aith <I>Eccle$ia$tes) and a-
<marg>* Chap. 1. v. 4, to
9.</marg>
nother Generation cometh: But the Earth abideth for ever.</I> ^{*} As
if <I>Solomon</I> did here di$pute with A$tronomers, and not rather put
men in minde of their Mutability; when as the Earth, Mankindes
habitation, doth alwaies remain the $ame: The Suns Motion
doth continually return into what it was at fir$t: The Wind is
acted in a Circle, and returns in the $ame manner: The Rivers
flow from their Fountains into the Sea, and return again from
thence unto their Fountains: To conclude, The Men of this
Age dying, others are born in their room; the Fable of Life is
ever the $ame; there is nothing new under the Sun. Here is no
reference to any Phy$ical Opinion. <G><*>on<*>esi\a</G> is Moral of a thing in it
$elf manife$t, and $een by the eyes of all, but little regarded: Tis
that therefore which <I>Solomon</I> doth inculcate. For who knows not
that the Earth is alwaies the $ame? Who $ees not that the Sun
dothari$e from the Ea$t; That the Rivers continually run into
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>465</p>
the Sea; That the vici$$itudes of the Windes return into their
primitive State; That $ome men $ucceed others? But who con-
$idereth that the $elf-$ame <I>Scene</I> of Life is ever acting, by diffe-
rent per$ons; and that nothing is <I>new</I> in humane affairs? There-
fore <I>Solomon</I> in$tancing in tho$e things which all men $ee, doth
put men in minde of that which many thorowly know, but too
$lightly con$ider.</P>
<P>But the 104. <I>P$alm</I> is thought by $ome to contain a Di$cour$e
altogether Phy$ical, in regard it onely concerns Natural Philo$o-
phy. Now God is there $aid, <I>To have laid the Foundations of
<marg>P$al. 104. v. 5.</marg>
the Earth, that it $hould not be removed for ever.</I> But here al-
$o the P$almi$t is far from the Speculation of Phy$ical Cau$es:
For he doth wholly acquie$ce in the Greatne$$e of God,
who did all the$e things, and $ings an Hymne to God the
Maker of them, in which he runneth over the World in order,
as it appeared to his eyes. And if you well con$ider this
P$alme, it is a Paraphra$e upon the $ix dayes work of the Crea-
tion: For as in it the three fir$t dayes were $pent in the Separa-
tion of Regions; the fir$t of Light from the exteriour Dark-
ne$s; the $econd, of the Waters from the Waters, by the inter-
po$ition of the Firm ament; the third, of the Sea from Land;
when al$o the Earth was cloathed with Herbage and Plants:
And the three la$t dayes were $pent in the filling the Re-
gions thus di$tingui$hed; the fourth, of Heaven; the
fifth, of the Seas and Aire; the fixth, of the Earth: So
here in this P$alme there are $o many di$tinct parts pro-
portionable to the Analogy of the $ix dayes Works. For
in <I>Ver$e</I> 2. he cloaths and covereth the Creator with Light
(the fir$t of Creatures, and work of the fir$t day) as with a
Garment. The $econd part beginneth at <I>Ver$e</I> 3. and treats of
the Waters above the Heavens, the extent of Heaven and of Me-
teors (which the P$almi$t $eemeth to intend by the Waters a-
bove) as namely of Clouds, Winds, Whirl-winds, Lightnings.
The third part begins at <I>Ver$e</I> 6. and doth celebrate the Earth
as the foundation of all tho$e things which he here con$idereth.
For he referreth all things to the Earth, and to tho$e Animals
which inhabit it, for that in the judgment of Sight the two prin-
cipal parts of the World are Heaven and Earth. He therefore
here ob$erveth that the Earth after $o many Ages hath not falte-
red, tired, or decayed; when as notwith$tanding no man hath
yet di$covered upon what it is founded. He goeth not about to
teach men what they do not know, but putteth them in minde
of what they neglect, to wit, the Greatne$$e and Power of God
in creating $o huge a Ma$s $o firm and $tedfa$t. If an A$trono-
mer $hould teach that the Earth is placed among the Planets, he
<foot>Nnn over-</foot>
<p n=>466</p>
overthroweth not what the P$almi$t here $aith, nor doth he con-
tradict Common Experience; for it is true notwith$tanding,
that the Earth, the Structure of God its Architect, doth not de-
cay (as our Buildings are wont to do) by age, or con$ume by
wormes, nor $way and leane to this or that $ide; that the Seats
and Ne$ts of Living Creatures are not mole$ted; that the
Mountains and Shores $tand immoveable again$t the violence of
the Winds and Waves, as they were at the beginning. But the
P$almi$t addeth a mo$t Elegant Hypothe$is of the Separation of
the Waters from the Continent or Main-land, and adorns it
with the production of Fountains, and the benefits that Springs
and Rocks exhibit to Birds and Bea$ts. Nor doth he omit the
apparelling the Earths Surface, mentioned by <I>Mo$es</I> among$t the
works of the third Day, but more $ublimely de$cribeth it in his
Ca$e in expre$$ions infu$ed from Divine In$piration; and flouri-
$heth out the commemoration of the many commodities which
redound from that Exornation for the Nouri$hment and Com-
<marg>* Shelter.</marg>
fort of Man, and ^{*} Covert of Bea$ts. The fourth part begins
at <I>Ver$e</I> 20. celebrating the fourth dayes work, <I>viz.</I> The Sun
and Moon, but chiefly the commodiou$ne$$e of tho$e things,
which in their Sea$ons befall to all Living Creatures and to Man;
this being the $ubject matter of his Di$cour$e: So that it plain-
ly appeareth he acted not the part of an A$tronomer. For if he
had, he would not then have omitted to mention the five Planets,
than who$e moiton nothing is more admirable, nothing more ex-
cellent, nothing that can more evidently $et forth the Wi$dome
of the Creator among$t the Learned. The fifth part begins,
<I>Ver$e</I> 25. with the fifth Dayes work. And it $tores the Seas with
Fi$hes, and covers them with Ships. The $ixth part is more ob-
$curely hinted at, <I>Ver$e</I> 28. and alludeth to the Land-Creatures
that were created the $ixth day. And la$tly, he declareth the
goodne$$e of God in general, who daily createth and pre$erveth
all things? So that whatever he $aid of the World is in relation
to Living Creatures; He $peaks of nothing but what is granted
on all hands; for that it was his intent to extol things known,
and not to dive into hidden matters, but to invite men to con-
template the Benefits that redouud unto them from the works of
each of the$e dayes.</P>
<P>And I do al$o be$eech my Reader, not forgetting the Divine
Goodne$$e conferred on Mankind; the con$ideration of which
the P$almi$t doth chiefly urge, that when he returneth from the
Temple, and enters into the School of <I>A$tronomy,</I> he would
with me prai$e and admire the Wi$dome and Greatne$$e of the
Creator, which I di$cover to him by a more narrow explication
of the Worlds Form, the Di$qui$ition of Cau$es, and Detection
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>467</p>
of the Errours of Sight: And $o he will not onely extoll the
Bounty of God in the pre$ervation of Living Creatures of all
kindes, and e$tabli$hment of the Earth; but even in its Motion
al$o, which is $o $trange, $o admirable, he will acknowledge the
Wi$dome of the Creator. But he who is $o $tupid as not to
comprehend the Science of <I>A$tronomy,</I> or $o weak and $crupu-
lous as to think it an offence of Piety to adhere to <I>Copernicus,</I>
him I advi$e, that leaving the Study of <I>A$tronomy,</I> and cen$uring
the opinions of Philo$ophers at plea$ure, he betake him$elf to
his own concerns, and that de$i$ting from further pur$uit of the$e
intricate Studies, he keep at home and manure his own Ground;
and with tho$e Eyes wherewith alone he $eeth, being eleva-
ted towards this to be admired Heaven, let him pour forth his
whole heart in thanks and prai$es to God the Creator; and a$-
$ure him$elf that he $hall therein perform as much Wor$hip to
God, as the <I>A$tronomer,</I> on whom God hath be$towed this Gift,
that though he $eeth more clearly with the Eye of his Under-
$tanding; yet whatever he hath attained to, he is both able and
willing to extoll his God above it.</P>
<P>And thus much concerning the Authority of Sacred Scripture.
Now as touching the opinions of the Saints about the$e Natural
Points. I an$wer in one word, That in Theology the weight of
Authority, but in Philo$ophy the weight of Rea$on is to be con-
$idered. Therefore Sacred was <I>Lactantius,</I> who denyed the
Earths rotundity; Sacred was <I>Augu$tine,</I> who granted the Earth
to be round, but denyed the <I>Antipodes</I>; Sacred is the ^{*}Liturgy of
<marg>* Officium</marg>
our Moderns, who admit the $mallne$$e of the Earth, but deny
its Motion: But to me more $acred than all the$e is Truth, who
with re$pect to the Doctors of the Church, do demon$trate
from Philo$ophy that the Earth is both round, circumhabited by
<I>Antipodes,</I> of a mo$t contemptible $malne$$e, and in a word,
that it is ranked among$t the Planets.</P>

Some pa$$ages in the Commentaries of
Didacus &agrave; Stunica,
OF
SALAMANCA
Upon <I>JOB:</I></head>
<head>The Toledo Edition, Printed by <I>JOHN RODERICK,

<head><I>Who $haketh the Earth out of her place, and the Pil-

<P>The Sacred Pen-man here $ets down another ef-
fect whereby God $heweth his Ahnighty Po-
wer, joyned with infinite Wi$dom. Which
place, though it mu$t be confe$$ed very diffi-
cult to under$tand, might be greatly cleared
by the Opinion of the <I>Pythagorians,</I> who
hold the Earth to be moved of its own Na-
ture, and that the Motion of the Stars can no other way be a$cer-
tained, they being $o extreamly different in tardity and velocity.
Of which judgement was <I>Philolaus,</I> and <I>Heraclides Ponticus,</I> as
<I>Plutarch</I> relateth in his Book <I>De Placitis Philo$ophorum</I>: Who
were followed by <I>Numa Pompilius,</I> and, which I more regard,
The Divine <I>Plato</I> in his old age; in$omuch that he affirmed that
it was mo$t ab$urd to think otherwi$e, as the $ame <I>Plutarch</I> tells
us in his ^{*} <I>Numa.</I> And <I>Hypocrates</I> in his Book <I>De Flatibus,</I>
<marg>* <I>In vita ejus.</I></marg>
calleth the Air <G>thsghso)xh)ma,</G> <I>i. e.</I> The Earths Chariot. But in this
<foot>our</foot>
<p n=>469</p>
our Age, <I>Copernicus</I> doth demon$trate the cour$es of the Pla-
nets to be according to this Opinion. Nor is it to be doubted
but that the Planets Places may be more exactly and certainly
a$$igned by his Doctrine, than by <I>Ptolomies</I> Great Almoge$t of
Sy$teme, or the Opinions of any others. For its manife$t, that
<I>Ptolomy</I> could never de$cribe either the Motion of the Equi-
noxes, or a$$ign the certain and po$itive beginning of the Year <*>
the which he ingeniou$ly confe$$eth in <I>Lih.</I> 3. <I>De Almage$t. Mag-
num. Ch.</I> 2. and which he leaveth to be di$covered in after times
by tho$e A$tronomers, who coming into the World much later
than he, might be able to invent $ome way to make more accurate
ob$ervations. And although the ^{*} <I>Alphon$ines &amp; Thebith Ben Core</I>
<marg>* Followers of
that Learned
Kings Hypothe-
$is.</marg>
have attempted to explain them; yet it appeareth that they have
done as much as nothing. For the Po$itions of the <I>Alphon$ines</I>
di$agree among$t them$elves, as <I>Ricius</I> proveth. And although
the Rea$on of <I>Thebith</I> be more acute, and that thereby he de-
termined the certain beginning of the year, (being that which
<I>Ptolomy</I> $ought for) yet it is now clear, that the Progre$$ions of
the Equinoxes are much longer than he conceived they could be.
Moreover, the Sun is found to be much nearer to us than it was
<marg>* That is 5000
miles; eight of
the$e making an
<I>Italian,</I> or <I>Engli$h</I>
mile of a 1000.
paces, every paco
containing 5.
Feet.</marg>
held to be in times pa$t, by above fourty thou$and ^{*} <I>Stadia,</I> or
furlongs. The Cau$e and Rea$on of who$e Motion, neither
<I>Ptolomy</I> nor any other A$trologers could ever comprehend: And
yet the Rea$ons of the$e things are mo$t plainly explained and
demon$trated by <I>Copernicus</I> from the Motion of the Earth, with
which he $heweth that all the other <I>Ph&oelig;nomena</I> of the Univer$e
do more aptly accord. Which opinion of his is not in the lea$t
contradicted by what <I>Solomon</I> $aith in ^{*} <I>Eccle$ia$tes: But the
<marg>* Chap. 1. v. 4.</marg>
Earth abideth for ever.</I> For that Text $ignifieth no more but
this, That although the $ucce$$ion of Ages, and generations of
Men on Earth, be various; yet the Earth it $elf is $till one and
the $ame, and continueth without any $en$ible alteration; For
the words run thus: <I>One Generation pa$$eth away, and another
Generation cometh; but the Earth abideth for ever.</I> So that it
hath no coherence with its Context, (as Philo$ophers $hew) if it
<marg>The Motion of
the Earth, not a-
gain$t Scripture.</marg>
be expounded to $peak of the Earths immobility. And al-
though in this Chapter <I>Eccle$ia$tes,</I> and in many others, Holy
Writ a$cribes Motion to the Sun, which <I>Copernicus</I> will have to
$tand fixed in the Centre of the Univer$e; yet it makes nothing
again$t his Po$ition. For the Motion that belongs to the Earth,
is by way of $peech a$$igned to the Sun, even by <I>Copernicus</I> him-
$elf, and tho$e who are his followers, $o that the Revolution of
the Earth is often by them phra$ed, The Revolution of the Sun.
To conclude, No place can be produced out of Holy Scripture,
which $o clearly $peaks the Earths Immobility, as this doth its
<foot>Mo-</foot>
<p n=>470</p>
Mobility. Therefore this Text, of which we have $poken, is ea-
$ily reconciled to this Opinion. And to $et forth the Wonder-
ful power and Wi$dome of God, who can indue and actuate the
Frame of the Whole Earth (it being of a mon$trous weight by
Nature) with Motion, this our Divine pen-man addeth; <I>And
the pillars thereof tremble:</I> As if he would teach us, from the
Doctrine laid down, that it is moved from its Foundations.</P>

<head>To the Mo$t
Reverend Father
SEBASTIANO FANTONI,
<I>General of the Order of</I>
CARMELITES.</head>
<P>In obedience to the command of the No-
ble <I>Signore Vincenzo Carraffa,</I> a Neapo-
litan, and Knight of S. <I>John of Jeru-
$alem,</I> (a per$on, to $peak the truth, of
$o great Merit, that in him Nobility of
Birth, Affability of Manners, Univer$al
knowledge of Arts and things, Piety
and Vertue do all contend for prehemi-
nence) I re$olved with my $elf to un-
dertake the Defence of the Writings of the New, or rather Re-
newed, and from the Du$t of Oblivion (in which it hath long
lain hid) lately Revived Opinion, <I>Of the Mobility of the Earth,
and Stability of the Sun,</I> in times pa$t found out fir$t by <I>Pytha-
goras,</I> and at la$t reduced into Practice by <I>Copernicus</I>; who like-
wi$e hath deduced the Po$ition of the Sy$teme and Con$titution
of the World and its parts from that Hypothe$is: on which
Subject I have formerly writ to You, Mo$t Reverend Sir: But
in regard I am bound for <I>Rome</I> to preach there by your Com-
mand; and $ince this Speculation may $eem more proper for a-
nother Treati$e, to wit, a Volume of <I>Co$mography,</I> which I am
in hand with, and which I am daily bu$ie about, that it may
come forth in company with my <I>Compendium of the Liberal Arts,</I>
which I have already fini$hed, rather than now to di$cu$s it by it
$elf, I thought to forbear, imparting what I have done for the
pre$ent; Yet I was de$irous to give, in the mean time, a brief ac-
count of this my Determination, and to $hew You, Mo$t Reve-
rend Father, (to whom I owe all my indeavours, and my very
$elf) the Foundations on which this Opinion may be grounded,
lea$t, whil$t otherwi$e it is favoured with much probability, it be
found in reality to be extreamly repugnant (as at fir$t $ight it
<foot>Ooo $eems)</foot>
<p n=>474</p>
$eems) not onely to Phy$ical Rea$ons, and Common Principles
received on all hands (which cannot do $o much ha<*>m) but al$o
(which would be of far wor$e con$equence) to many Authori-
ties of $acred Scripture: Upon which account many at their
fir$t looking into it, explode it as the mo$t fond Paradox and
Mon$trous <I>Capriccio</I> that ever was heard of. Which thing pro-
ceeds only from an antiquated and long confirmed Cu$tome,
which hath $o hardened men in, and habituated them to Vul-
gar, Plau$ible, and for that cau$e by all men (a$well learned as
unlearned) Approved Opinions, that they cannot be removed
one $tep from them: So great is the force of Cu$tome (which
not unfitly is $tiled a $econd Nature) prevailing over the whole
World, that touching things men are rather plea$ed with, de-
lighted in, and de$irous of tho$e, which, though evil and obnox-
ious, are by u$e made familiar to them, than $uch, wherewith,
though better, they are not accu$tomed and acquainted. So in
like manner, and that chiefly, in <I>Opinions,</I> which when once they
are rooted in the Mind, men $tart at, and reject all others
what$oever; not only tho$e that are contrary to, but even all
that ever $o little di$agree with or vary from theirs, as har$h to
the Ear, di$coloured to the Eye, unplea$ant to the Smell, nau$e-
ous to the Ta$t, rough to the Touch. And no wonder: For
Phy$ical Truths are ordinarily judged and con$idered by men,
not according to their E$$ence, but according to the pre$cript of
$ome one who$e de$cription or definition of them gaines him
Authority among$t the vulgar. Which authority neverthele$s
($ince 'tis no more than humane) ought not to be $o e$teemed, as
that that which doth manife$tly appear to the contrary, whether
from better Rea$ons lately found out, or from Sen$e it $elf, $hould
for its $ake be contemned and $lighted; Nor is Po$terity $o to be
confined, but that it may, and dares, not only proceed farther,
but al$o bring to light better and truer Experiments than tho$e
which have been delivered to us by the Ancients. For the <I>Ge-
nius's</I> of the Antients, as in Inventions they did not much $ur-
pa$s the Wits of our times; $o for the perfecting of Inventions
this Age of ours $eems not only to equal, but far to excell former
Ages; Knowledge, whether in the Liberal or Mechanical Arts,
daily growing to a greater height. Which A$$ertion might be
ea$ily proved, were it not that in $o clear a ca$e, there would be
more danger of ob$curing, than hopes of illu$trating it with any
farther light.</P>
<P>But (that I may not wholly be $ilent in this point) have not the
$everal Experiments of Moderns, in many things, $topped the
mouth of Venerable Antiquity, and proved many of their great-
te$t and weightie$t Opinions, to be vain and fal$e? The Doctrine
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>475</p>
of the <I>Antipodes</I> by many of the Antients of approved Wi$-
dome and Learning was held a Paradox no le$s ab$urd than this
Our Opinion of the <I>Earths Motion</I> may $eem to be; as likewi$e
that of the <I>Habitablene$$e of the Torrid Zone</I>: Of the$e Opini-
ons, the fir$t was accounted unpo$$ible by many, but the latter
was ab$olutely denyed by the unanimous con$ent of all: But
later Authors (to the great felicity and perpetual Glory of
their Age) have, not $o much by Authority, as by accurate
diligence and indefatigable $tudy to finde out the truth, pro-
ved them both to be undoubtedly true. Thus I affirm that
the Antients were deceived, and that in too lightly challenging
Credid and Authority for their Inventions, they di$covered too
much folly. Here for brevities $ake I pa$s by many Dreams
lately detected, both of <I>Ari$totle</I> and other of the antient Philo-
$ophers; who in all likelihood if they had dived into the Ob$er-
vations of Modern Writers, and under$tood their Rea$ons, would,
by changing their Judgements, have given them the precedency,
and would have $ub$cribed to their manife$t Truth. Hereby we
$ee that we are not to have $o high a re$pect for the Antiens, that
whatever they a$$ert $hould be taken upon tru$t, and that Faith
$hould be given to their $ayings, as if they were Oracles and
Truths $ent down from Heaven. But yet (which indeed is
chiefly to be regarded in the$e matters) if any thing be found out
that is repugnant to Divine Authority, or to the Sacred Leaves,
that were dictated by the Holy Gho$t, and by His In$piration
<marg><I>Faith is more
certain, than ei-
ther Sen$e or Rea-
$on.</I></marg>
expounded by the Holy Doctors of the Church, in this ca$e not
onely Humane Rea$on, but even Sen$e it $elf is to $ubmitt:
which, though by all manner of weighty Conditions and circum-
$tances it $hould hold forth any thing contrary to Divine Autho-
rity, (which indeed is $o plain, that there is no way left to evade
the right un er$tanding of it) yet is it to be rejected; and we
mu$t conclude our $elves deceived by it, and believe that that is
not true which Sen$e and Rea$on repre$ents unto us: For, however
we judge of things, we have, both in this and all other ca$es, a
more certain knowledge, which proceeds from Divine Faith; as
S. <I>Peter</I> hath mo$t excellently expre$t it: Who though with his
Sen$es he $aw, and perceived the Glory of our Lord in his
Transfiguration, and heard his words manife$ting his great Pow-
er, yet neverthele$s all the$e things compared with the Light of
Faith, he adds: ^{*}<I>We have al$o a more $ure word of Prophecy,</I> &amp;c.
<marg>* 2 Pet. 1. 19.</marg>
Wherefore $ince this Opinion of <I>Pythagoras</I> and <I>Copernicus</I> hath
entred upon the Stage of the World in $o $trange a Dre$s, and at
the fir$t appearance (be$ides the re$t) doth $eem to oppo$e $un-
dry Authorities of Sacred Scripture, it hath (this being granted)
been ju$tly rejected of all men as a meer ab$urdity.</P>
<foot>Ooo 2 But</foot>
<p n=>476</p>
<P>But yet becau$e the common Sy$teme of the World devi$ed by
<I>Ptolomy</I> hath hitherto $atisfied none of the Learned, hereupon a
$u$pi<*>ion is ri$en up among$t all, even <I>Ptolemy's</I> followers them-
$elves, that there mu$t be $ome other Sy$teme, which is more true
than this of <I>Ptolemy</I>; For although the <I>Ph&oelig;nomena</I> of Cele$tial
Bodys may $eem to be generally re$olved by this Hypothe$is, yet
they are found to be involved with many difficulties, and refer-
red to many devices; as namely of Orbes of $undry Forms and
Figures, Epicicles, Equations, Differences, Excentricks, andinnu-
merable $uch like fancies and Chym&aelig;ra's which $avour of the
<I>Ens Rationis</I> of Logicians, rather than of any <I>Realem E$$entiam.</I>
Of which kinde is that of the <I>Rapid Motion,</I> than which I finde
not any thing that can be more weakly grounded, and more ea$i-
ly controverted and di$proved: And $uch is that conceit of the
^{*} Heaven void of Stars, moving the inferior Heavens or Orbes:
<marg>* Or <I>Primu<*>
Mobile.</I></marg>
All which are introduced upon occa$ion of the variety of the
Motions of Cele$tial Bodyes, which $eemed impo$$ible, by any
other way, to be reduced to any certain and determinate Rule.
So that the A$$ertors of that common Opinion, freely confe$s,
that in de$cribing the Worlds Sy$teme, they cannot as yet di$co-
ver, or teach the true Hypothe$is thereof: But that their endea-
vours are onely to finde out, among$t many things, what is mo$t
agreeable with truth, and may, upon better and more accomo-
date Rea$ons, an$wer the Cele$tial <I>Ph&oelig;nomena.</I></P>
<P>Since that, the Tele$cope (an Optick Invention) hath been found
out, by help of which, many remarkable things in the Heavens,
mo$t worthy to be known, and till then unthought of, were di$-
covered by manife$t $en$ation; as for in$tance, That the Moon is
Mountainous; <I>Venus</I> and <I>Saturn</I> Tricorporeal; and <I>Jupiter</I>
Quadricorporeal: Likewi$e that in the <I>Via Lactea,</I> in the <I>Ple-
iades,</I> and in the Stars called <I>Nobulo$&oelig;</I> there are many Stars, and
tho$e of the greate$t Magnitude which are by turns adjacent to
one another; and in the end it hath di$covered to us, new fixed
Stars, new planets, and new Worlds. And by this $ame In$tru-
ment it appears very probable, that <I>Venus</I> and <I>Mercury</I> do not
move properly about the Earth, but rather about the Sun; and
that the Moon alone moveth about the Earth. What therefore
can be inferred from hence, but that the Sun doth $tand immo-
vable in the Centre, and that the Earth, with the other Cele$tial
Orbes, is circumvolved about it? Wherefore by this and many
other Rea$ons it appears, That the Opinion of <I>Pythagor as</I> and
<I>Copernicus</I> doth not di$agree with A$tronomical and Co$mogra-
phical Principles; yea, that it carryeth with it a great likelihood
and probability of Truth: Whereas among$t the $o many $eve-
ral Opinions, that deviate from the common Sy$teme, and devi$e
<foot>others,</foot>
<p n=>477</p>
others, $uch as were tho$e of <I>Plato, Calippus, Eudoxus</I>; and $ince
<marg>* Cardan de re-
rum variet. Lib. 1.
Cap. 1.</marg>
them of <I>Averroe, ^{*} Cardanus, Fraca$torius,</I> and others both Anti-
ent and Modern, there is not one found that is more facile, more
regularly ahd determinately, accommodated to the <I>Ph&oelig;nomena</I>
and Motions of the Heavens, without <I>Epicycles, Excentrix, Ho-
mocentricks</I> Deferents, and the $upputation of the Rapid Motion.
And this Hypothe$is hath been a$$erted for true, not onely by
<I>Pythagoras,</I> and, after him, by <I>Copernicus,</I> but by many famous
men, as namely, <I>Heraclitus,</I> and <I>Ecphantus, Pythagoreans,</I> all the
Di$ciples of that Sect, <I>Miceta</I> of <I>Syracu$e, Martianus Capella,</I> and
many more. Among$t whom, tho$e (as we have $aid) that
have attempted the finding out of New Sy$temes (for they refu-
$ed both this of <I>Pythagoras,</I> and that of <I>Ptolemy)</I> are numberle$s:
who yet notwith$tanding allowed this Opinion of <I>Pythagoras</I> to
carry with it much probability, and indirectly confirmed it; ina$-
much as that they rejected the common one as imperfect, defe-
<marg>* P. Clavins in
ultima $uor. Ope-
rum editione.</marg>
ctive, and attended with many contradictions and difficulties.
Among$t the$e may be numbered Father ^{*} <I>Clavius,</I> a mo$t learn-
ed Je$uite; who, although he refutes the Sy$teme of <I>Pythagoras,</I>
yet acknowledgeth the Levity of the common Sy$teme, and he
ingeniou$ly confe$$eth, that for the removal of difficulties, in which
the common Sy$teme will not $erve the turn, A$tronomers are
forced to enquire after another Sy$teme, to the di$covery of
which, he doth very earne$tly exhort them.</P>
<P>Now can there a better or more commodious Hypothe$is
be devi$ed, than this of <I>Copernicus,</I>? For <I>t</I>his Cau$e many Mo-
dern Authors are induced to approve of, and follow it: but
with much h&aelig;$itancy, and fear, in regard that it $eemeth in their
Opinion $o to contradict the Holy Scriptures, as that it cannot
po$$ibly be reconciled to them. Which is the Rea$on that this
Opinion hath been long $uppre$t, and is now entertained by men
in a mode$t manner, ad as it were with a veiled Face; according
to that advice of the Poet:</P>
<P><I>Judicium populi nunquam contemp$eris unus,</I></P>
<P><I>Ne nullis place as, dum vis contemnere multos.</I></P>
<P>Upon con$ideration of which, (out of my very great love to-
wards the Sciences, and my ardent defire to $ee the encrea$e and
perfection of them, and the Light of Truth freed from all Er-
rours and Ob$curities) I began to argue with my $elf touching
this Point after this manner: This Opinion of the <I>Pythagoreans</I>
is either true, or fal$e; If fal$e, it ought not to be mentioned, and
de$erves not to be divulged: If true, it matters not, though it
contradict all, as well Philo$ophers as A$tronomers: And though
for its e$tabli$hment and reducement to u$e a new Philo$ophy
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>478</p>
and A$tronomy, ($ounded upon new Principles and Hypothe$e)
$hould be con$tituted: For the Authority of Sacred Scripture
will not oppo$e t<*>; neither doth one Truth contradict another.
If therefore the Opinion of <I>Pythagoras</I> be true, without doubt
God hath di$po$ed and dictated the words of of Holy Writ in
$uch a manner, that they may admit an apt $en$e and reconcil<*>
tion with that Hypothe$is. Being moved by the$e Rea$ons, and
the probability of the $aid Opinion, I thought good to try whe-
ther Texts of Sacred Scripture might be expounded according to
Theological and Phy$ical Principles, and might be reconciled to
it, $o that (in regard that hitherto it hath been held probable) it
may in after times, coming without $cruple to be acknowledged
for true, advance it $elf, and appear in publick with an uncover-
ed Face, without any mans prohibition, and may lawfully and
freely hold a Sacred intelligence with Holy Truth, $o earne$tly
coveted and commended by good Men. Which de$igne, having hi-

many of the Mo-
derns.</I></marg>
therto been undertaken by none that I know, wil, I am per$waded,
be very acceptable to the Studious of the$e Learnings, e$pecially to
the mo$t Learned <I>Galil&oelig;o Galil&oelig;i,</I> chief Mathematician to the
mo$t Serene Grand Duke of <I>Tu$cany,</I> and <I>John Kepler,</I> chief
Mathematician to his Sacred and invincible Maje$ty, the Empe-
rour, and to all that Illu$trious, and much to be commended Ac-
cademy of the <I>Lynceans</I>; whom, if I mi$take not, are all of this
Opinion. Although I doubt not but they, and many other
Learned Men might ea$ily have found out the$e or the like Re-
conciliations of Scriptural expre$$ions; to whom neverthele$s I
have thought fit (in re$pect of that profe$$ion which I have under-
taken, upon the faith of my $oul, and the propen$ity that I have
towards Truth) to offer that of the Poet,</P>
<P><I>Nullius addictus jur are in verba Magi$tri.</I></P>
<P>And in te$timony of my e$teem to them and all the Learned,
to communicate the$e my thoughts; confidently a$$uring my $elf
that they will accept them, with a Candor equal to that where-
with I have written them.</P>
<P>Therefore to come to the bu$ine$s: All Authorities of Di-
vine Writ which $eem to oppo$e this Opinion, are reducible to
$ix Cla$$es: The fir$t is of tho$e that affirm the Earth to $tand
$till, and not to move: as <I>P$al. 92. He framed the round World
$o $ure, that it cannot be moved</I>: Al$o <I>P$al. 104. Who laid the
Foundations of the Earth, that it $hould not be removed for ever</I>:
And <I>Eccle$ia$tes 1. But the Earth abideth for ever</I>: And others
of the like $en$e.</P>
<P>The $econd is of tho$e which atte$t the Sun to move, and
<foot>Revolve</foot>
<p n=>479</p>
Revolve about the Earth; as <I>P$al. 19. (b) In them hath be $et a

Tabernacle for the Sun, which cometh forth as a Bridegroom out
of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his Cour$e. It
cometh forth from the uttermo$t part of the Heaven, and runneth
about unto the end of it again; and there is nothing hid from the
heat thereof.</I> And <I>Eccle$ia$t. 1. The Sun ri$eth, and the Sun go-
eth down, and ha$teth to the place where be aro$e: it goeth towards
the South, and turneth about unto the North.</I> Whereupon the
Suns Retrogradation is mentioned as a Miracle, <I>I$aiah 38. The
Sun returned ten degrees.</I> And <I>Eccle$ia$ticus 48. In his time the
Sun went backward, and lengthened the life of the King.</I> And
for this rea$on it is related for a Miracle, in the Book of <I>Jo$buah,</I>
that at the Prayers of that great Captain the Sun $tood $till, its
motion being forbidden it, by him<I>: Jo$h.</I>10. <I>Sun $tand thou
$till upon Gibeon.</I> Now if the Sun $hould $tand $till, and the
Earth move about it, its $tation at that time was no Miracle;
and if <I>Jo$huah</I> had intended, that the light of the day $hould
have been prolonged by the Suns $plendour, he would not have
$aid, <I>Sun $tand thou $till,</I> but rather <I>Earth $tand thou $till.</I></P>
<P>The third Cla$$is is of tho$e Authorities which $ay, that Hea-
ven is <I>above,</I> and the Earth <I>beneath</I>; of which $ort is that place
of <I>Joel, chap.</I> 2. cited by S. <I>Peter,</I> in <I>Acts. 2. I will $hew wonders
in Heaven above, and $ignes in the Earth beneath,</I> with others of
the like purport. Hereupon Chri$t at his Incarnation is $aid to
<I>come down from Heaven</I>; and after his Re$urrection to have <I>a$-
cended up into heaven.</I> But if the Earth $hould move about
the Sun, it would be, as one may $ay, in Heaven, and con$e-
quently would rather be <I>above</I> Heaven than <I>beneath</I> it. And
this is confirmed; For that the Opinion which placeth the Sun in
the Centre, doth likewi$e place <I>Mercury</I> above the Sun, and
<I>Venus</I> above <I>Mercury</I>; and the Earth above <I>Venus,</I> together
with the Moon, which revolves about the Earth, and therefore
the Earth, together with the Moon, is placed in the third Heaven.
If therefore in Spherical Bodies, as in the World, <I>beneath</I> $igni-
<marg><I>In Spberieall
Bodies,</I> Deor$um
<I>is the Centre, and</I>
Sur$um <I>the Cir-
cumference.</I></marg>
fies no more than to be neer to the centre, and <I>above,</I> than to
approach the Circumference, it mu$t needs follow, that for ma-
king good of Theological Po$itions concerning the A$cen$ion
and De$cen$ion of Chri$t, the Earth is to be placed in the cen-
tre, and the Sun, with the other Heavens in the Circumference;
and not according to <I>Copernicus,</I> who$e Hypothe$is inverts this
Order: with which one cannot $ee how the true A$cen$ion and
De$cen$ion can be con$i$tent.</P>
<P>The fourth Cla$$is is of tho$e Authorities which make Hell to
be in the Centre of the World, which is the Common Opinion
of Divines, and confirmed by this Rea$on, That $ince Hell (ta-
<foot>ken</foot>
<p n=>480</p>
ken in its $trict denomination) ought to be in the lowe$t part of
the World, and $ince that in a Sphere there is no part lower
then the Centre, Hell $hall be, as it were, in the Centre of the
World, which being of a Spherical Figure, it mu$t follow, that
<marg><I>Hell is in the
centre of the
Earth, not of the
World.</I></marg>
Hell is either in the Sun (fora$much as it is $uppo$ed by this Hy-
pothe$is to be in the Centre of the World) or el$e $uppo$ing
that Hell is in the Centre of the Earth, if the Earth $hould move
about the Sun, it would nece$$arily en$ue, that Hell, together
with the Earth, is in Heaven, and with it revolveth about the third
Heaven; than which nothing more ab$urd can be $aid or imagi-
ned.</P>
<P>The fifth Cla$$is, is of tho$e Authorities which alwayes op-
<marg><I>Heaven and
Earth are always
mutually oppo$ed
to each other.</I></marg>
po$e Heaven to the Earth, and $o again the Earth to Heaven; as
if there were the $ame relation betwixt them, with that of the
Centre to the Circumference, and of the Circumference to the
Centre. But if the Earth were in Heaven, it $hould be on one
$ide thereof, and would not $tand in the Middle, and con$equent-
ly there would be no $uch relation betwixt them; which never-
thele$s do, not only in Sacred Writ, but even in Common Speech,
ever and every where an$wer to each other with a mutual Oppo-
fition. Whence that of <I>Gene$. 1. In the beginning God created
the Heaven and the Earth</I>: and <I>P$al. 115. The Heaven, even
the Heavens are the Lords; but the Earth hath he given to the
Children of men:</I> and our Saviour in that Prayer which he pre-
$cribeth to us, <I>Matth. 6. Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in
Heaven:</I> and S. <I>Paul, 1 Corinth. 15. The fir$t man is of the
Earth, earthy; the $econd man is of Heaven, heavenly:</I> and
<I>Colo$$. 1. By him were all things created that are in Heaven, and
that are in Earth</I>: and again, <I>Having made peace through the
Blood of his Cro$$e for all things, whether they be things in Earth
or things in Heaven:</I> and <I>Chap. 3. Set your affections on things
above, not on things on the Earth</I>; with innumerable other $uch
like places. Since therefore the$e two Bodies are alwayes mu-
tually oppo$ed to each other, and Heaven, without all doubt,
referreth to the Circumference, it mu$t of nece$$ity follow, that
the Earth is to be adjudged the place of the Centre.</P>
<P>The $ixth and la$t Cla$$is is of tho$e Authorities, which (being
rather of Fathers and Divines, than of the Sacred Scripture) $ay,
That the Sun, after the day of Judgment $hall $tand immoveable
<marg><I>After the day
of Judgment the
Earth $hall $tand
immoveable.</I></marg>
in the Ea$t, and the Moon in the We$t. Which Station, if the
<I>Pythagorick</I> Opinion hold true, ought rather to be a$cribed to
the Earth, than to the Sun; for if it be true, that the Earth doth
now move about the Sun, it is nece$$ary that after the day of
Judgment it $hould $tand immoveable. And truth is, if it mu$t
$ub$i$t without motion in one con$tant place, there is no rea$on
<foot>why</foot>
<p n=>481</p>
why it $hould rather $tand in one $ite of that Place than in ano-
ther, or why it $hould rather turn one part of it than another to
the Sun, if $o be that every of its parts without di$tinction, which
is de$titute of the Suns light, cannot choo$e but be di$mal, and
much wor$e affected than that part which is illuminated. Hence
al$o would ari$e many other ab$urdities be$ides the$e.</P>
<P>The$e are the Cla$$es, &amp;c. from which great a$$aults are made
again$t the $tructure of the Pythagorick Sy$teme; yet by that
time I $hall have fir$t laid down $ix Maximes or Principles, as
impregnable Bulwarks erected again$t them, it will be ea$ie to
batter them, and to defend the Hypothe$is of <I>Pythagoras</I> from
being attaqued by them. Which before I propound, I do pro-
fe$s (with that Humility and Mode$ty which becometh a Chri-
$tian, and a per$on in Religious Orders) that I do with reverence
$ubmit what I am about to $peak to the Judgment of Holy
Church. Nor have I undertaken to write the$e things out of
any inducements of Temerity, or Ambition, but out of Charity
and a De$ire to be auxiliary to my neighbour in his inqui$ition
after Truth. And there is nothing in all this Controver$ie
maintained by me (that expect to be better in$tructed by tho$e
who profe$s the$e Studies) which I $hall not retract, if any per-
$ons $hall by $olid Rea$ons &amp; reiterated Experiments, prove $ome
other Hypothe$is to be more probable; but yet, until $uch time as
they $hall decide the Point, I $hall labour all I can for its $upport.</P>
<P>My fir$t and chiefe$t Maxime is this; When any thing is at-
tributed in Holy Writ, to God, or to a Creature, thats not be-
$eeming to, or incommen$urate with them, it mu$t of nece$$ity
be received and expounded one, or more of the four following
wayes; Fir$t, it may be $aid to agree with them <I>Metaphorically,
and Proportionally, or by Similitude.</I> Secondly, <I>According to
our manner of Con$idering, Apprehending, Conceiving, Vnder$tand-
ing, Knowing, &amp;c.</I> Thirdly, <I>according to the Opinion of the
Vulgar, and the Common way of Speaking:</I> to which Vulgar
Speech the Holy Gho$t doth very often with much $tudy acco-
modate it $elf. Fourthly, <I>In re$pect of our $elves, and for that
he makes him$elf like unto us.</I> Of each of the$e wayes there are
the$e examples: God doth not walk, $ince he is Infinite and Im-
moveable; He hath no Bodily Members, $ince he is a Pure Act;
and con$equently is void of all Pa$$ion of Minde; and yet in
Sacred Scripture, <I>Gen. 3. ver$.</I> 8. it is $aid, <I>He walked in the cool of
the day</I>: and <I>Job 22. ver$.</I> 14. it is $aid, <I>He walketh in the ^{*} Cir-
<marg>* Circa Cardi-
nes C&oelig;li.</marg>
cuit of Heaven:</I> and in many other places coming, departing,
making ha$t is a$cribed to God; and likewi$e Bodily parts, as
Eyes, Ears, Lips, Face, Voice, Countenance, Hands, Feet, Bow-
els, Garments, Arms; as al$o many Pa$$ions, $uch as Anger,
<foot>Ppp Sor-</foot>
<p n=>482</p>
Sorrow, Repentance, and the like. What $hall we $ay there-
fore? Without doubt $uch like Attributes agree with God (to
u$e the Schoolmens words <I>Metaphorically, Proportionally, and by
Similitude</I>: And touching Pa$$ions, it may be $aid, that God
conde$cendeth to repre$ent him$elf after that manner: as for
in$tance, <I>The Lord is angry</I>; i.e. <I>He revealeth him$elf as one that
is angry: He grieved</I>; i. e. <I>He revealeth him$elf, as one that
is $orrowful: It repented him that he had made man</I>; i.e. <I>He $ee-
med as one that repented.</I> And indeed all the$e things are <I>Com-
parativ&egrave; ad nos,</I> and in re$pect of us. So God is $aid to be in
Heaven, to move in time, to $hew him$elf, to hide him$elf, to
ob$erve and mark our $teps; to $eek us, to $tand at the door,
to knock at the door; not that he can be contained in a bodily
place, nor that he is really moved, nor in time; nor that humane
manners or cu$tomes can agree with him, $ave only according to
our manner of Apprehen$ion: This Conception of ours orderly
di$tingui$heth the$e Attributes in him one from another, when,
notwith$tanding, they are one and the $ame with him: This Ap-
prehen$ion of ours divideth al$o his actions into $everal times,
which, neverthele$$e, for the mo$t part, are produced in one and
the $ame in$tant: And this, to conclude, alwayes apprehendeth
tho$e things with $ome defect, which, notwith$tanding are in
God mo$t perfect. For this rea$on doth the Sacred Scripture
expre$s it $elf <I>according to the Vulgar Opinion,</I> whil$t it a$cribes
to the Earth Ends and Foundations, which yet it hath not; to
the Sea a Depth not to be fathomed; to Death (which is a Pri-
vation, and con$equently a Non entity) it appropriates Actions,
Motion, Pa$$ions, and other $uch like Accidents, of all which it is
deprived, as al$o Epithites and Adjuncts, which really cannot
$uit with it: <I>Is not the bitterne$$e of Death pa$t</I>? 1 Sam. 15. 32.
<I>Let death come upon them,</I> P$al 6. <I>He hath prepared the In$tru-
ments of Death,</I> P$al. 7. 14. <I>Thou rai$e$t me from the gates of
Death,</I> P$al. 84. <I>In the mid$t of the $hadow of Death,</I> P$al. 23.
<I>Love is $trong as Death,</I> Cant. 8. 9. <I>The Fir$t-Born of Death,</I> Job
18. 13. <I>De$truction and Death $ay, &amp;c.</I> Job 28. 22. And who knows
not that the whole Hi$tory of the rich Glutton doth con$i$t of
<marg>Luke 16.</marg>
the like phra$es of <I>Vulgar Speech</I>? So <I>Eccle$ia$ticus,</I> Chap. 27.
ver$. 11. <I>The godly man abideth in wi$dome, as the Sun; but a
fool changeth as the Moon</I>; and yet the Moon according to the
real truth of the matter no wayes changeth, but abides the $ame
for ever, as <I>A$tronomers</I> demon$trate, one half thereof remain-
ing alwayes lucid, and the other alwayes opacous. Nor at any
time doth this $tate vary in it, unle$$e <I>in re$pect of us,</I> and <I>ac-
cording to the opinion of the Vulgar.</I> Hence it is cleer, that the
holy Scripture $peaks according to the common form of $peech u-
<foot>$ed</foot>
<p n=>483</p>
$ed among$t the unlearned, and according to the appearance of
things, and not according to their true Exi$tence. In like man-
ner <I>Gene$.</I> 1. in the de$cription of the Creation of all things,
the Light is $aid to be made fir$t of all, and yet it followeth in
the Text, <I>And the Evening and the Morning made the fir$t day</I>:
and a little after the $everal Acts of the Creation are di$tingui$hed
and a$$igned to $everal days, and concerning each of them it is
$aid in the Text, <I>And the Evening and the Morning made the
$econd day</I>; and then <I>the third day, the fourth day, &amp;c.</I> Hence
many doubts ari$e, all which I $hall propound according to the
common Sy$teme, that it may appear even from the <I>H</I>ypothe$is
of that Sy$teme, that the $acred Scripture $ometimes, for the a-
voyding of emergent difficulties, is to be under$tood in a vulgar
$en$e and meaning, and in re$pect of us, and not according to
the nature of things. Which di$tinction even <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
<marg>Alia $unt notio-
ra nobis, alia, no-
tiora natura, vel
$ecundum $e, <I>A-
r $t. lib. 1. Phy$.</I></marg>
$eemeth to have hinted, when he $aith, ^{*} <I>Some things are more
intelligible to us; others by nature,</I> or <I>$ecundum $e.</I></P>
<P>Fir$t therefore; If the light were made before heaven, then
it rolled about without heaven to the making of the di$tinction
of Day and Night. Now this is contrary to the very doctrine
of the$e men, who affirm that no C&oelig;le$tial Body can be moved
unle$$e <I>per accidens,</I> and by the motion of <I>H</I>eaven, <I>and as a knot
in a board at the motion of the board.</I> Again, if it be $aid, that
the Light was created at the $ame time with <I>H</I>eaven, and began
to be moved with <I>H</I>eaven, another doubt ari$eth, that likewi$e
oppo$eth the fore$aid common <I>Hypothe$is:</I> For it being $aid,
that Day and Night, Morning and Evening were made, that $ame
is either in re$pect of the Univer$e, or onely in re$pect of the
Earth and us. If $o be that the Sun turning round (according to
the <I>Hypothe$is</I> of the Common Sy$teme) doth not cau$e the
Night and Day, but only to opacous Bodies which are de$titute
of all other light, but that of the Sun, whil$t in their half part
(which is their <I>Hemi$ph&oelig;re)</I> and no more, (for that the Suns
light pa$$eth over but one half of an opacous Body, unle$s a ve-
ry $mall matter more in tho$e of le$$er bulk) they are illumina-
ted by the Suns a$pect, the other half remaining dark and tene-
bro$e, by rea$on of a $hadow proceeding from its own Body.
Therefore the di$tinction of dayes by the light of heaven, ac-
cording to the de$cription of them in the $acred Scriptures, mu$t
not be under$tood <I>ab$olutely,</I> and <I>$ecundum $e,</I> and <I>Nature her
$elf</I>; but in re$pect of the Earth, and of us its inhabitants, and
con$equently <I>$ecundum nos.</I> 'Tis not therefore new, nor unu-
$ual in $acred Scripture to $peak of things <I>$ecundum nos,</I> and on-
ly <I>in re$pect of us,</I> and <I>$ecundum apparentiam</I>; but not <I>$ecundum
$e,</I> and <I>reinaturam,</I> or <I>Ab$olutely</I> and <I>Simply.</I></P>
<foot>Ppp 2 And</foot>
<p n=>484</p>
<P>And if any one would under$tand the$e Days of $acred Scri-
pture, not only <I>$ecundum nos,</I> but al$o <I>$ecundum naturam,</I> as
circulations of C&oelig;le$tial Light returning to the $elf $ame point
from whence it did at fir$t proceed; $o as that there needs no
re$pect to be had to Night or to ^{*} Darkne$$e, for which $ole rea-
<marg>* Aut ad Umbram</marg>
$on we are fain to imbrace the Interpretation of $acred Scripture
<I>$ecundum nos</I>; In oppo$ition to this we may thus argue: If the
$acred Scripture be under$tood to $peak <I>ab$olutely,</I> of iterated
and $ucce$$ive circulations of light, and not <I>re$pectu no$tri,</I> as if
the$e words <I>Evening and Morning</I> had never been in$erted, which
in their natural acceptation denote the Suns habitude to us and to
the Earth: For that the <I>Morning</I> is that time when the Sun be-
gins to wax light, and to ri$e above the <I>Horizon</I> in the Ea$t,
and become vi$ible in our <I>Hemi$ph&oelig;re,</I> and <I>Evening</I> is the time
in which the Sun declines in the We$t, and approacheth with its
light neerer to the other oppo$ite <I>Horizon</I> and <I>Hemi$ph&oelig;re,</I>
which is contiguous to this of ours. But the word <I>Day</I> is a Co-
relative to the word <I>Night.</I> From hence therefore it evidently
appeareth, that the$e three words <I>Evening, Morning,</I> and <I>Day,</I>
cannot be under$tood of a Circulation of Light <I>$ecundum $e,</I>
and <I>ab$olut&egrave;,</I> but only <I>$ecundum nos,</I> and <I>re$pectu no$tri</I>; and in
that $en$e indeed the <I>Morning</I> and <I>Evening</I> do make the <I>Night</I>
and <I>Day,</I></P>
<P>In like manner, <I>Gen.</I> 1. 16. it is $aid, <I>God made two great Lights;
the greater Light to rule the Day, and the le$$er Light to rule the
Night, and the Stars.</I> Where both in the Propo$ition and in the
$pecification of it, things are $poken which are very di$agreeing
with C&oelig;le$tial Bodies. Therefore tho$e words are in that place
to be interpreted according to the fore$aid Rules; namely, ac-
cording to the third and fourth; $o that they may be $aid to be
under$tood <I>according to the $en$e of the vulgar, and the common
way of $peaking,</I> which is all one, as if we $hould $ay, <I>$ecundum
apparentiam,</I> and <I>$ecundum nos, vel re$pectu no$tri.</I> For fir$t, it
is $aid in the Propo$ition, <I>And God made two great Lights</I>;
meaning by them the Sun and Moon, whereas according to the
truth of the matter the$e are not the Greater Lights; For al-
though the Sun may be reckoned among$t the Greater, the Moon
may not be $o, unle$s <I>in re$pect of us.</I> Becau$e among$t
tho$e that are ab$olutely the Greater, and a little le$$er than the
<marg><I>Which are really
the great Lights
in Heaven.</I></marg>
Sun (nay in a manner equal to it) and far bigger than the Moon,
we may with great rea$on enumerate <I>Saturn,</I> or $ome of the
Fixed Stars of the fir$t Magnitude, $uch as <I>Canopus,</I> (otherwi$e
called <I>Arcanar)</I> in the end of a River; or the <I>Little Dog</I> in
the mouth of the <I>Great Dog</I>; or the Foot of <I>Orion,</I> called <I>Ri-
gel</I>; or his <I>Right $houlder,</I> or any other of that Magnitude.
<foot>There-</foot>
<p n=>485</p>
Therefore the <I>two great Lights</I> are to be under$tood in re$pect of
us, and according to vulgar e$timation, and not according to the
true and reall exi$tence of $uch Bodies. Secondly, in the $peci-
fication of the Propo$ition it is $aid, <I>The greater Light to rule the
Day</I>; hereby denoting the Sun; in which the verbal $en$e of
Scripture agreeth with the Truth of the Thing; For that the Sun
is the Greate$t of all Luminaries, and Globes. But that which
followeth immediately after, <I>And the le$$er Light to rule the
Night,</I> meaning the Moon, cannot be taken in the true and real
$en$e of the words: For the Moon is not the le$$er Light, but
<I>Mercury</I>; which is not only much le$$er than the Moon, but al$o
than any other Star. And if, again, it be $aid, That the Holy
Text doth not $peak of the Stars, but onely of the Luminaries,
for that pre$ently after they are mentioned apart, <I>And the Stars</I>;
and that what we $ay is true touching the compari$on of the Stars
among$t them$elves, but not in re$pect of the Luminaries, name-
ly, the Sun and Moon: This reply doth di$cover a man to be
utterly ignorant in the$e Studies, and $uch who having not the
lea$t $mattering in them, doth conceive an ab$urd and erroneous
Opinion of the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies. For the Moon and Sun, con-
$idered in them$elves, and as they appear to us, if they $hould
be a far greater di$tance from us, than indeed they are, would be
no other, nor would appear to us otherwi$e than Stars, as the
re$t do in the Firmament. But Great Luminaries they neither
<marg><I>The Sun, Moon,
and Stars are one
&amp; the $ame thing.</I></marg>
are, nor $eem to be, $ave only <I>in re$pect of us:</I> And $o, on
the other $ide, the Stars, as to them$elves, are no other than $o
many Suns and $o many Moons; yet are $o far remote from us,
that by rea$on of their di$tance they appear thus $mall, and dim
of light, as we behold them. For the greater and le$$er di$tance
of heavenly Bodies <I>(c&aelig;teris paribus)</I> doth augment and dimini$h
their appearance both as to Magnitude and Light. And there-
fore the words which follow in that place of <I>Gene$is, And the
Stars</I> (as di$tingui$hing the Stars from the Sun and Moon) are
to be taken in no other acceptation than that which we have $po-
ken of, namely, <I>according to the $en$e of the Vulgar, and the
common manner of $peech.</I> For indeed, according to the truth
of the matter, all C&oelig;le$tial Bodies, being $hining Globes, are of
a va$t bigne$s, to which if we $hould be $o neer as we are to the
Moon, they would $eem to us of as great, yea a greater magni-
tude than the Moon: As likewi$e on the contrary, if we were as
far di$tant from the Sun and Moon, as we are from them, both
Moon and Sun would $hew but as $tars to us. And yet the
$plendor of the Sun would doubtle$s be greater <I>inten$iv&egrave;</I> than
that of any other $tar. For, although it $hould be granted that
$ome $tars (as tho$e of the Fixed that twinkle) do $hine of them-
<foot>$elves</foot>
<p n=>486</p>
$elves, aud by their own nature, as the Sun, that derives not its
light from others (which yet remains undecided and doubtful)
and borrow not their light from the Sun; Neverthele$s $ince the
brightne$s of none of the $tars may be compared with the Suns
$plendour, which was created by God fir$t, and before all other
Luminaries, in the highe$t kind of Light, it would therefore
notwith$tanding follow, that none of tho$e $tars, although pla-
ced in the $ame proximity to us with the Sun, and therefore ap-
pearing to us of the $ame Magnitude as the Sun, can be$tow up-
on us $o much Light as we receive from the Sun: As on the
contrary, the Sun, at the $ame remotene$$e from us as they are,
would indeed, as to its Magnitude, appear to us as one of tho$e
$tars, but of a $plendour much more <I>inten$e</I> than that of theirs.
<marg><I>The Earth is a-
nother Moon or
Star.</I></marg>
So that, now, the Earth is nothing el$e but another Moon or $tar,
and $o would it appear to us, if we $hould behold it from a con-
venient di$tance <I>on high.</I> And in it might be ob$erved (in that
variety of Light and Darkne$s which the Sun produceth in it by
making Day and Night) the $ame difference of A$pects that are
$een in the Moon, and $uch as are ob$erved in tricorporate <I>Ve-
nus</I>; in like manner al$o 'tis very probable that the $ame might
be di$cerned in other Planets, which $hine by no light of their
own, but by one borrowed from the Sun. What ever there-
fore may touching the$e matters be delivered in the $acred Leaves
or the common $peech of men, di$$enting from the real truth, it
ought (as we have $aid before) ab$olutely to be received and un-
der$tood <I>$ecundum vulgi $ententiam, &amp; communem loquendi &amp;
concipiendi $tylum.</I></P>
<P>And $o, to return to our purpo$e, if, all this con$idered, the
<I>Pythagorian</I> opinion be true, it will be ea$ie, according to the
$ame Rule, to reconcile the authority of $acred Scriptures with
it, however they $eem to oppo$e it, and in particular tho$e of the
fir$t and $econd Cla$$is, <I>$cilicet</I> by my fir$t <I>Maxime:</I> For that in
tho$e places the holy Records $peak according to our manner of
under$tanding, and according to that which appeareth in re$pect
of us; <I>For thus it is with tho$e Bodies, in compari$on of us, and</I>
<marg><I>Why the Sunne
$eemeth to us to
move, &amp; not the
Earth.</I></marg>
<I>as they are de$cribed by the vulgar and commune way of humane
Di$cour$e; So that the Earth appears as if it were $tanding $till
and immoveable, and the Sun, as if it were circumambient about
her.</I> And $o the Holy Scripture is u$ed in the Commune and
Vulgar way of $peaking; becau$e in re$pect of our $ight, the
Earth $eems rather to $tand fixed in the Centre, and the Sun to
circumvolve about it, than otherwi$e: as it happens to tho$e that
are putting off from the Banks of a River to whom the $hose
$eems to move backwards, and go from them: but they do not
perceive (which yet is the truth) that they them$elves go forwards.
<foot>Which</foot>
<p n=>487</p>
Which fallacy of our $ight is noted, and the Rea$on thereof a$-
$igned by the Opticks; upon wich, as being $trange to, and be-
$ides my purpo$e, I will not $tay) and on this account is <I>&AElig;neas</I>

<marg><I>&AElig;neid.</I> 3.</marg>
<head><I>Provehimur portu, terr&aelig;que urbe$que recedunt.</I></head>
<P>But it will not be ami$s to con$ider why the $acred Scripture
doth $o $tudiou$ly comply with the opinions of the Vulgar, and
why it doth not rather accurately in$truct men in the truth of the
matters, and the $ecrets of Nature. The Rea$on is, fir$t, the be-
nignity of Divine Wi$dome, whereby it $weetly accomodates it
$elf to all things, in proportion to their Capacity and Nature.
Whence in Natural Sciences, it u$eth natural and nece$$ary cau-
$es, but in Liberal Arts it worketh liberally, upon Generous
Per$ons after a $ublime and lofty manner; upon the Common
People, familiarly and humbly; upon the Skilful, learnedly;
upon the Simple, vulgarly; and $o on every one, according to
his condition and quality. Secondly, becau$e it is not its In-
tention to fill our mindes in this life with vain and various curi-
o$ities, which might occa$ion our doubt and $u$pen$e. For the

Moreover it did not only permit, but even decree, thatth e

tations, and that it $hould be imployed about the uncertainty of
<marg><I>(b) Chap. 3. v.</I> 11.</marg>
things; according to that $aying of <I>Eccle$ia$tes</I> <I>(b) He hath
$et the World in their heart; $o that no man can find out the work
that God maketh from the beginning unto the end.</I> And touching
tho$e doubts, God will not permit that they $hall be di$covered

to us before the end of the World: <I>(c) At which time he will

<p n=>488</p>
in all humane Sciences; but making no account of the$e things
he profe$$eth that it was his de$ire to teach them no more but the
way to Heaven. Hence is that which God $peaketh to us by
<marg><I>(i)</I> I$a. <I>c. 48. v.</I> 17.</marg>
<I>I$aiah,</I> <I>(i) Ego Dominus Deus, docens te utilia</I> [<I>I am the Lord
thy God which teacheth thee profitable things:</I>] Where the <I>Glo$-
$ary</I> addeth, <I>non $ubtilia</I> [not $ubtilties.] For God neither taught
us, Whether the <I>Materia Prima</I> of Heaven, and the Elements
be the $ame; nor Whether <I>Cominual</I> be compo$ed of Indivi$i-
bles, or whether it be divi$ible <I>in infinitum</I>; nor, whether the
Elements are formally <I>mixt</I>; nor how many the C&oelig;le$tial
Spheres, and their Orbs are; Whether there be Epicycles or
Eccentricks; nor the Vertues of Plants and Stones; nor the Na-
ture of Animals; nor the Motion and Influence of the Planets;
nor the Order of the Univer$e; nor the Wonders of Minerals,
and univer$al Nature: but only [<I>utilia:</I>] things profitable, to
wit, his Holy Law ordained to the end, that we being put into
po$$e$$ion of Ble$$edne$s, might at length be made capable of all
perfect knowledge, and the vi$ion of the whole Order and ad-
mirable Harmony, as al$o the Sympathy and Antipathy of the
Univer$e and its parts, <I>in his Word,</I> wherein all tho$e
things $hall mo$t clearly and di$tinctly, then, appear to us, which
mean while, in this life, he hath remitted (as far as its ability
reacheth) to humane $earch and enquiry: But it was not his
purpo$e to determine any thing, directly or indirectly, touching
the truth of them. Becau$e as the knowledge thereof would lit-
tle or nothing profit Us, but might in $ome ca$es prove prejudi-
cial; $o the ignorance thereof can doubtle$s be no detriment,
but may in $ome ca$es be very beneficial to us. And therefore
by his mo$t admirable Wi$dome it comes to pa$s, that though all
things in this World are dubious, uncertain, wavering, and per-
plexed; yet his Holy Faith alone is mo$t certain; and although
the opinions about Philo$ophical and Doctrinal points be divers,
there is in the Church but one Truth of Faith and Salvation.
Which Faith, as nece$sary to Salvation, is $o ordered by Divine
Providence, that it might not only be indubitable, but al$o un-
$haken, $ure, immutable, and manife$t to all men: the infallible
Rule of which he hath appointed the Holy Church, that is wa$h-
ed with his precious Blood, and governed by his Holy Spirit, to
whom belongs our Sanctification, as being his work. This there-
<marg>1 The$$. 4.</marg>
fore is the Rea$on why God would have Speculative Que$tions,
which nothing conduce to our Salvation and Edification, and why
the Holy Gho$t hath very often conde$cended to Vulgar Opini-
ons and Capacities, and hath di$covered nothing that is $ingular
or hidden to us, be$ides tho$e things that pertain to Salvation.
So that con$equently it is clear by what hath been $aid, how and
<foot>why</foot>
<p n=>489</p>
why nothing of certainty can be evinced from the fore$aid Au-
thorities to the determining of Controver$ies of this Nature; as
al$o with what Rea$on from this fir$t <I>Axiome</I> the Objections of
the fir$t and $econd Cla$$e are ea$ily an$wered, as al$o any other
Authority of $acred Scripture produced again$t the <I>Pythagorian</I>
and <I>Copernican</I> Sy$teme $o long as by other proofs it is true.</P>
<P>And the Authorities of the $econd Cla$$e in particular by
this $ame Maxime, <I>Of the ordinary manner of apprehending
things as they appear to us, and after the common way of $peak-
ing,</I> may be thus reconciled and expounded; namely, Oftentimes
an Agent is commonly, and not improperly $aid to move, (though
it have no motion) not becau$e it doth indeed move, but <I>by ex-
trin$ick denomination,</I> becau$e receiving its influence and action at
the motion of the Subject; the Form and Quality infu$ed to
the Subject by the $aid Agent doth likewi$e move. As for ex-
ample, a Fire burning in a Chimney is an immoveable Agent,
before which a man oppre$t with cold $its to warm him$elf who
being warmed on one $ide, turns the other to the Fire, that he
may be warmed on that $ide al$o, and $o in like manner he holds
every part to the Fire $ucce$$ively, till his whole body be warm-
ed. 'Tis clear, that although the Fire do not move, yet at the
Motion of the Subject, to wit the Man, who receiveth the heat
and action of the Fire, the Form and Quality of its Heat doth
move <I>$ingulatim, &amp; per partes,</I> round about the mans body, and
alwayes $eeketh out a new place: and $o, though the Fire do
not move, yet by rea$on of its effect, it is $aid to go round all
the parts of the Mans body, and to warm it, not indeed by a
true and real motion of the Fire it $elf, $ince it is $uppo$ed (and
that not untruly) not to move, but by the motion to which the
Body is excited, out of a de$ire of receiving the heat of the Fire
in each of its parts. The $ame may be applied to the Illumina-
tion impre$$ed $ucce$$ively on the parts of any Globe, which
moves Orbicularly at the a$pect of a $hining immoveable
Light. And in the $ame manner may the Sun be $aid to ri$e and
$et, and to move above the Earth, although in reality he doth
not move, nor $uffer any mutation; that is to $ay, Ina$much as
his Light (which effect is the Form and Quality proceeding from
him, as the Agent, to the Earth as the Subject) doth $en$ibly
glide forwards, by rea$on of the Orbicular motion of the Earth;
and doth alwayes be take it $elf to $ome new place of her $urface;
upon which ground he is truly $aid <I>($ecundum vnlgarem $ermo-
nem)</I> to move above, and revolve about the Earth: Not that the
Sun doth move, (for by this Opinion we affirm the Earth to
move, that it may receive the Sun one while in one, another
while in another part of it) but that at the motion of the Earth
<foot>Qqq her</foot>
<p n=>490</p>
her $elf a contrary way, the Quality diffu$ed into her, and im-
pre$$ed upon her by the Sun, namely the Light of the Day is
moved, which ri$eth in one part of her, and $ets in another con-
trary to that, according to the nature and condition of her motion;
And for this rea$on the Sun it $elf by con$equence is $aid to ri$e
and $et, (which notwith$tanding <I>ex Hypothe$i</I> $tands immovea-
ble) and that no otherwi$e then <I>per donominationem extrin$ecam,</I>
as hath been $aid.</P>

perly, but the Suns $plendour upon the Earth $tood $till; $o that
not the Sun it $elf, (being of it $elf before that time immovea-
ble) but the Earth that receiveth its $plendour, $tayed her Mo-
tion; which, as $he ince$$antly pur$uing her ordinary Motion to-

After the $ame manuer pioportionally is that Text of <I>I$aiah</I> ex-
plained, touching the Suns going ten degrees back ward upon the
Dial of <I>Ahaz.</I> So (which may $erve for another Example) the
Hand being moved about the flame of a burning Candle that
$tands $till, the Light moveth on the Hand, that is to $ay, the
$aid Hand is illu$trated now in one part, anon in another, when
as the Candle it $elf all the while removes not out of its place:
whereupon <I>per denominationem extrin$ecam,</I> the $aid Light may
be affirmed to ri$e and $et upon the Hand, namely, by the $ole
motion of the $aid Hand, the Candle it $elf never moving all the
while. And let this $uffice for the explanation of my fir$t Prin-
ciple or <I>Maxime,</I> which by rea$on of its difficulty and extraordi-
nary weight required $ome prolixity in the handling of it.</P>
<P>My $econd Maxime is this, Things both Spiritual and Cor-
poreal, Durable and Corruptible, Moveable and Immoveable,
have received from God a perpetual, unchangeable, and inviola-
ble Law, con$tituting the E$$ence and Nature of every one of
them: according to which Law all of them in their own Na-
ture per$i$ting in a certain Order and Con$tancy, and ob$erving
the $ame perpetual Cour$e, may de$ervedly be $tiled mo$t Stable
and Determinate. Thus Fortune (than which there is nothing
in the World more incon$tant or fickle) is $aid to be con$tant
and unalterable in her continual volubility, vici$$itude, and in-
con$tancy, which was the occa$ion of that Ver$e,</P>
<head><I>Et $emper con$tans in levitate $ua e$t.</I></head>
<P>And thus the motion of Heaven (which by the con$tan Law
<foot><I>of</I></foot>
<p n=>491</p>
of Nature ought to be perpetual) may be $aid to be immutable
and immoveable, and the Heavens them$elves to be immovea-
bly moved, and Terrene things to be immutably changed, be-
cau$e tho$e never cea$e moving, nor the$e changing. By this Prin-
ciple or Maxime all difficulties belonging to the fir$t Cla$$is are
cleared, by which the Earth is $aid to be $table and immoveable,
that is, by under$tanding this one thing, That the Earth, as to its
own Nature, though it include in it $elf a local Motion, and that
threefold, according to the opinion of <I>Copernicus ($cilicet</I> Diur-
<marg><I>Several Motions
of the Earth ac-
cording to</I> Coper-
nicus.</marg>
nal, with which it revolveth about its own Centre; Annual,
by which it moveth through the twelve Signes of the Zodiack,
and the motion of Inclination, by which its Axis is alwayes op-
po$ed to the $ame part of the World) as al$o other Species of
Mutation, $uch as Generation and Corruption, Accretion and
Diminution, and Alteration of divers kinds; yet in all the$e $he
is $table &amp; con$tant, never deviating from that Order which God
hath appointed her, but moveth continually, con$tantly and im-
mutably, according to the $ix before named Species of Motion.</P>
<P>My third Maxime $hall be this; When a thing is moved ac-
cording to $ome part of it, and not according to its whole, it
cannot be $aid to be <I>$imply &amp; ab$olutely</I> moved, but only <I>per acci-
dens,</I> for that $tability taken $imply &amp; ab$olutly do rather accord
with the $ame. As for example, if a Barrel or other mea$ure of
Water be taken out of the Sea, and transferred to another place,
the Sea may not therefore <I>ab$olutely &amp; $imply</I> be $aid to be remo-
ved from place to place; but only <I>per accidens,</I> and <I>$ecundum
quid,</I> that is, according to a part of it, but rather (to $peak $im-
ply) we $hould $ay that the Sea cannot be carried or moved out of
its proper place,, though as to its parts it be moved, and transfer-
red to &amp; again. This Maxime is manife$t of it $elf, and by it may
the Authorities be explained which $eem to make for the immo-
bility of the Earth in this manner; namely, The Earth <I>per $e &amp;
ab$olut&egrave;</I> con$idered as to its <I>Whole,</I> is not mutable, $eeing it is
neither generated nor corrupted neither increa$ed nor dimini$hed;
neither is it altered <I>$ecundum totum,</I> but only <I>$ecundum partes.</I>
<marg><I>The Earth Se-</I>
cundum Totum <I>is
Immutable,
though not Immo-
vable.</I></marg>
Now it plainly appears, that this is the genuine and true Sen$e of
what is a$cribed to it out of <I>Eccle$ia$tes, cap. 1. v. 4. One Generation
pa$$eth away, and another Generation cometh, but the Earth abideth
for ever</I>: as if he $hould $ay; although the Earth, according to its
parts, doth generate and corrupt, and is liable to the vici$$itudes of
Generation and corruption, yet in reference to its Whole it never
generateth nor Corrupteth, but abideth immutable for ever:
Like as a Ship, which though it be mended one while in the Sail-
yard, another while in the Stern, and afterwards in other parts
it yet remains the $ame Ship as it was at fir$t. But tis to be ad-
<foot>Qqq 2 verti$ed</foot>
<p n=>492</p>
vertized, that that Scripture doth not $peak of a Local Motion,
but of Mutations of another nature; as in the very $ub$tance,
quantity or quality of the Earth it $elf. But if it be $aid, that
it is to be under$tood of a Local Motion, then it may be ex-
plained by the in$uing Maxime, that is to $ay, a re$pect being had
to the natural Place a$$igned it in the Univer$e, as $hall be $hewed
by and by.</P>
<P>The fourth Axiome is this; That every Corporeal thing, mo-
veable or immoveable from its very fir$t Creation, is alotted its
proper and natural place; and being drawn or removed from
thence, its motion is violent, and it hath a natural tendency to
move back thither again: al$o that nothing can be moved from
its natural place, <I>$ecundum Totum</I>; For mo$t great and dread$ul
mi$chiefs would follow from that perturbation of things in the
Univer$e. Therefore neither the whole Earth, nor the whole
<marg><I>The Earth can-
not</I> Secundum To-
tum, <I>remove out of
its Natural Place.</I></marg>
Water, nor the whole Air can <I>$ecundum totum</I> be driuen or for-
ced out of their proper place, $ite, or Sy$teme in the Univer$e,
in re$pect of the order and di$po$ition of other mundane Bodies.
And thus there is no Star (though Erratick) Orb or Sphere that
can de$ert its natural place, although it may otherwi$e have $ome
kind of motion. Therefore all things, how moveable $oever,
are notwith$tanding $aid to be $table and immoveable in their
proper place, according to the fore$aid $en$e, <I>i.e. $ecundum to-
tum</I>; For nothing hinders, but that <I>$ecundum partes</I> they may
$ome waymove; which motion $hall not be natural, but violent.
Therefore the Earth, although it $hould be moveable, yet it
might be $aid to be immoveable, according to the precedent
Maxime, for that its neither moved in a right Motion nor out of
the Cour$e a$$igned it in its Creation for the $tanding Rule of its
motion; but keep within its own $ite, being placed in that
which is called the Grand Orb, above <I>Venus,</I> and beneath <I>Mars,</I>
<marg><I>The Natural
Place of the Earth.</I></marg>
and being in the middle betwixt the$e (which according to the
common opinion is the Suns place) it equally and continually
moveth about the Sun, and the two other intermediate Planets,
namely <I>Venus</I> and <I>Mercury,</I> and hath the Moon (which is another
Earth, but &AElig;therial, as <I>Macrobius</I> after $ome of the ancient Phi-
<marg><I>The Moon is an
&AElig;therial Body.</I></marg>
lo$ophers, will have it) about it $elf. From whence, ina$much as
$he per$i$teth uniformly in her Cour$e, and never at any time
departeth from it, $he may be $aid to be $table and immoveable:
and in the $ame $en$e Heaven likewi$e, with all the Elements,
may be $aid to be immoveable.</P>
<P>The fifth Maxime followeth, being little different from the
former. Among$t the things created by God, $ome are of $uch a
nature, that their parts may be <I>ab invicem,</I> or by turns, $e-
parated from them$elves, and di$-joyned from their Whole;
<foot>others</foot>
<p n=>493</p>
others may not, at lea$t, taken <I>collectively</I>: now tho$e are pe-
ri$hable, but the$e perpetual. The Earth therefore $ince it
is reckoned among$t tho$e things that are permanent, as hath
<marg><I>The Earths Cen-
tre keepeth it in
its Natural Place.</I></marg>
been $aid already, hath its parts, not di$$ipable, nor <I>ab invicem,</I>
$eparable from its Centre (whereby its true and proper place is
a$$igned it) and from its whole, taken collectively: becau$e ac-
cording to its whole it is always pre$erved, compact, united, and
coh&aelig;rent in it $elf, nor can its parts be $eperated from the Cen-
tre, or from one another, unle$s it may $o fall out <I>per accidens,</I>
and violently in $ome of its parts; which afterwards, the ob$tacle
being removed, return to their Natural Station $pontaneou$ly,
and without any impul$e. In this Sen$e therefore the Earth is
$aid to be Immoveable, and Immutable: yea even the Sea, Aire,
Heaven, and any other thing (although otherwi$e moveable) $o
long as its parts are not di$$ipable and $eperable, may be $aid to
be Immoveable, at lea$t taken <I>collectively.</I> This Principle
or Maxim differeth from the precedent only in that this referrs
to the parts in order to <I>Place,</I> and this, in order to the Whole.</P>
<P>From this Speculation another Secret is di$covered. For hence
<marg><I>Gravity and Le-
vity of Bodies,
what it is.</I></marg>
it is manife$t wherein the proper and genuine formality of the
Gravity aad Levity of Bodyes con$i$teth; a point which is not $o
clearly held forth, nor $o undeniably explained by the Peripate-
tick Phylo$ophy. <I>Gravity</I> therefore is nothing el$e according to
the Principles of this new Opinion, than a certain power and ap-
petite of the Parts to rejoyn with their Whole, and there to re$t
as in their proper place. Which Faculty or Di$po$ition is by
Divine Providence be$towed not only on the Earth, and Ter-
rene Bodies, but, as is believed, on C&oelig;le$tial Bodies al$o, name-
<marg><I>All C&oelig;le$tial Bo-
dies have Gravity
and Levety.</I></marg>
ly the Sun, Moon, and Starrs; all who$e parts are by this Impul-
$ion connected, and con$erved together, cleaving clo$ely to each
other, and on all $ides pre$$ing towards their Centre, until they
come to re$t there. From which Concour$e and Compre$$ion a
Sph&aelig;rical and Orbicular Figure of the C&aelig;le$tial Orbes is produ-
ced, wherein by this occult Quality naturally incident to
each of them they of them$elves $ub$i$t, and are alwayes pre$er-
ved. But <I>Levity</I> is the Extru$ion and Exclu$ion of a more te-
nuo$e and thin Body from the Commerce of one more Solid and
<marg><I>Compre$$ive Ma-
tion, proper to
Gravity; the Ex-
ten$ive, to Levity.</I></marg>
den$e, that is Heterogeneal to it, by vertue of Heat. Where-
upon, as the Motion of Grave Bodies is <I>Compre$$ive,</I> $o the Mo-
tion of Light Bodies is <I>Exten$ive:</I> For its the propperty of Heat
to dilate and rarify tho$e things to which it doth apply, conjoine
and communicate it $elf. And for this rea$on we find Levity
and Gravity not only in re$pect of this our Tere$trial Globe, and
the Bodies adjacent to it, but al$o in re$pect of tho$e Bodies
which are $aid to be in the Heavens, in which tho$e parts which
<foot>by</foot>
<p n=>494</p>
by rea$on of their proclivity make towards their Centre are
Grave, and tho$e that incline to the Circumference Light. And
$o in the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, there are parts as well Grave as
<marg><I>Heaven is not
compo$ed of a fift
E$$ence differing
from the matter of
inferior Bodies.</I></marg>
Light. And con$equently Heaven it $elf that $o Noble Body,
and of a fifth E$$ence, $hall not be con$tituted of a Matter diffe-
rent from that of the Elements, being free from all Mutation in
it's Sub$tance, Quantity, and Quality: Nor $o admirable and
<marg><I>Nor yet a Solid
or den$e Body but
Rare.</I></marg>
excellent as <I>Ari$totle</I> would make us to believe; nor yet a $olid
Body, and impermeable; and much le$$e (as the generality of
men verily believe) of an impenetrable and mo$t obdurate Den-
$ity: but in it (as this Opinion will have it) Comets may be ge-
nerated; and the Sun it $elf, as tis probable, exhaling or attract-
ing $undry vapours to the $urface of its Body, may perhaps pro-
duce tho$e Spots which were ob$erved to be $o various, and irre-

hath mo$t excellently and mo$t accurately $poken; in$omuch,
that though it were not be$ides my pre$ent purpo$e, yet it is con-
venient that I forbear to $peak any thing touching tho$e matters,
lea$t I $hould $eem to do that which he hath done before me: But
now if there be found in the Sacred Scriptures any Authority
contrary to the$e things, it may be $alved by the fore$aid Argu-
ments Analogically applyed. And further more it may be $aid,
that that Solidity is to be $o under$tood, <I>as that it admits of no
vacuum, cleft, or penetration from whence the lea$t vacuity might
proceed</I> For the truth is, as that cannot be admitted in bodily
Creatures, $o it is likewi$e repugnant to Heaven it $elf, being
indeed a Body of its own Nature the mo$t Rare of all o-

thers, and tenuo$e beyond all Humane Conception, and happly
hath the $ame proportion to the Aire, as the Aire to the
Water.</P>
<P>It is clear al$o from the$e Principles how fal$e the$e words of
<I>Ari$totle</I> are, that: <I>Of one $imple Body, there is one $imple Motion</I>;
<I>and this is of two kindes, Right and Circular: the Right is two-
fold, from the medium, and to the medium; the fir$t of Light Bo-
dyes, as the Aire and Fire: the $econd of Grave Bodyes, as the
Water and Earth: the Circular, which is about the medium, be-
longeth to Heaven, which is neither Grave nor Light</I>: For all this
Philo$ophy is now for$aken, and of it $elf grown into di$-e$teem;
for though it be received for an unque$tionable truth in this new
Opinion, that to a $imple body appertains one only $imple Moti-
<marg>* <I>Vide Coperni-
cum de Revolutio-
nibus C&oelig;le$t.</I></marg>
on, yet it granteth no Motion but what is Circular, by which alone
a$imple body is con$erved in its naturall Place, and $ub$i$ts in its
Unity, and is properly $aid to move <I>in loco</I> [<I>in a place</I>:] whereby
<marg><I>Simple Motion
peculiar to only
Simple Bodies.</I></marg>
it comes to pa$s that a Body for this rea$on doth continue to move
in it $elf, [<I>or about its own axis</I>;] and although it have a Motion,
<foot>yet</foot>
<p n=>495</p>
yet it abideth $till in the $ame place, as if it were perpetually im-
moveable. But right Motion, which is properly <I>ad locum, [to a
place]</I> can be a$cribed only to tho$e things which are out of their
naturall place, being far from union with one another, and from
unity with their whole, yea that are $eperated and divided from
it: Which being that it is contrary to the Nature and forme of
the Univer$e, it nece$$arily followeth, that right Motion doth in
<marg><I>Right Motion
belongeth to Im-
perfect Bodies, and
that are out of
their natural Pla-
ces.</I></marg>
$hort $ute with tho$e things which are de$titute of that perfection,
that according to their proper Nature belongeth to them, and
which by this $ame right Motion they labour to obtaine, untill
they are redintigrated with their Whole, and with one another,
and re$tored to their Naturall place; in which at the length,
having obtained their perfection, they $ettle and remaine immove-
able. Therefore in right Motions there can be no Uniformity,
<marg><I>Right Motion
cannot be Simple.</I></marg>
nor $implicity; for that they vary by rea$on of the uncertaine
Levity or Gravity of their re$pective Bodyes: for which cau$e
they do not per$evere in the $ame Velocity or Tardity to the end
which they had in the beginning. Hence we $ee that tho$e things
who$e weight maketh them tend downwards, do de$cend at fir$t
with a $low Motion; but afterwards, as they approach neerer
and neerer to the Centre, they precipitate more and more $wiftly.
And on the other$ide, tho$e things which by rea$on of their light-
ne$s are carryed upwards (as this our Terre$triall fire, which is no-
thing el$e but a $moak that burneth, and is inkindled into a flame)
are no $ooner a$cended on high, but, in almo$t the $elf-$ame mo-
ment, they fly and vani$h out of fight; by rea$on of the rare-
faction and exten$ion, that they as $oon as they acquire, are freed
from tho$e bonds which violently and again$t their own Nature
<marg><I>Right Motion is
ever mixt with
the Circular.</I></marg>
kept them under, and deteined them here below. For which
rea$on, it is very apparent, that no Right Motion can be called
Simple, not only in regard that (as hath been $aid) it is not
^{*} even and uniforme, but al$o becau$e it is mixt with the Circu-
<marg>* <I>&aelig;quabilis.</I></marg>
lar, which lurketh in the Right by an occult con$ent, <I>$cilicet</I> by
rea$on of the Natural affection of the Parts to conforme unto
their Whole. For when the Whole moveth Circularly, it is re-
qui$ite likewi$e that the Parts, to the end that they may be uni-
ted to their Whole, (howbeit <I>per accidens</I> they are $ometimes
moved with a Right Motion) do move (though not $o appa-
rently) with a Circular Motion, as doth their Whole. And thus
at length we have evinced that Circular Motion only is Simple,
<marg>* <I>Even.</I></marg>
Uniform and ^{*} &AElig;quable, and of the $ame tenor [<I>or rate</I>] for that
<marg><I>Circular Mo-
tion is truly Sim-
ple and Perpetual.</I></marg>
it is never de$titute of its interne Cau$e: whereas on the contra-
ry, Right Motion, (which pertains to things both Heavy and
Light) hath a Cau$e that is imperfect and deficient, yea that ari-
$eth from Defect it $elf, and that tendeth to, and $eeketh after
<foot>no</foot>
<p n=>496</p>
nothing el$e but the end and termination of it $elf: in regard
that Grave and Light Bodies, when once they have attained their
proper and Natural Place, do de$i$t from that Motion to which
they were incited by Levity and Gravity. Therefore: $ince Cir-
<marg><I>Circular Mo-
tion belongeth to
the Whole Body,
and the Right to
its parts.</I></marg>
cular Motion is proper <I>to the Whole,</I> and Right Motion <I>to the
Parts,</I> the$e differences are not rightly referred to Motion, $o as
to call one Motion Right, another Circular, as if they were not
con$i$tent with one another: For they may be both together, and
<marg><I>Circular and
Right Motion co-
incedent, and may
con$i$t together in
the $ame Body.</I></marg>
that Naturally, in the $ame Body; no le$$e than it is equally
Natural for a Man to participate of Sen$e and Rea$on, $eeing
that the$e differences are not directly oppo$ite to one another.
Hereupon Re$t and Immobility only are oppo$ed to Motion;
and not one Species of Motion to another. And for the other
differences <I>&agrave; medio, ad medium,</I> and <I>circa medium,</I> they are di-
$tingui$hed not <I>really,</I> but only <I>formally,</I> as the Point, Line and
Superficies, none of which can be without the other two, or
without a Body. Hence it appears, that in as much as this Phy-
lo$ophy differs from that of <I>Ari$totle,</I> $o in like manner doth this
New Co$mographical Sy$tem vary from the Common one, that
hath been hitherto received. But this by the way, upon occa$ion
of explaining the Fifth Maxim: For as to the truth or fal$hood
of the$e foregoing Po$itions (although I conceive them very pro-
bable) I am re$olved to determine nothing at pre$ent, neither
$hall I make any farther enquiry into them.</P>
<P>The Sixth and La$t Maxim is this. Every thing is Simply deno-
minated $uch as it is in compari$on of all things, or of many
things which make the greater number of that kinde, but not in
re$pect of a few which make but the le$$er part of them. As,
for in$tance, a Ve$$el $hall not be called ab$olutely Great be-
cau$e it is $o whil$t it is compared with two or three others: but
it $hall be $aid to be great ab$olutely, and will be $o, if it ex-
ceed in magnitude all indivials, or the greater part of them. Nor
again $hall a Man be $aid to be ab$olutely Big, becau$e he is big-
ger than a Pigmey; nor yet ab$olutely Little, becau$e le$$e than
a Gyant: but he $hall be termed ab$olutely Big or Little in com-
pari$on of the ordinary Stature of the greater part of Men. Thus
the Earth cannot ab$olutely be $aid to be High or Low for that it
is found to be $o in re$pect of $ome $mall part of the Univer$e; nor
again $hall it be ab$olutely affirmed to be High, being compared
to the Centre of the World, or $ome few parts of the Univer$e,
more near to the $aid Centre, as is the <I>Sun, Mercury</I> or <I>Venus</I>:
<marg><I>The Earth in
what $en$e it may
<*>b$olutely be $aid
<*> be in the lowe$t
part of the World.</I></marg>
but it $hall receive its ab$olute denomination according as it $hall
be found to be in compari$on of the greater number of the
Spheres and Bodies of the Univer$e. The Earth therefore, in
compari$on of the whole Circuit of the Eighth Sph&aelig;re which in-
<foot>cludeth</foot>
<p n=>497</p>
cludeth all Corporeal Creatures, and in compari$on of <I>Jupiter,
Mars,</I> and <I>Saturn</I> together with the <I>Moon,</I> and much more in
compari$on of other Bodies, (if any $uch there be) above the
Eighth Sphere and e$pecially the Empyrial Heaven, may be truly
$aid to be in the lowe$t place of the World, and almo$t in the
Centre of it; nor can it he $aid to be above any of them, except
the <I>Sun, Mercury</I> and <I>Venus</I>: So that one may apply unto it the
name of an Infime and Low, but not a Supreme or Middle Body.
And $o to come down from Heaven, e$pecially the Empyrian, to it
(as it is accepted in the De$cent of Chri$t from Heaven to his Holy
Incarnation) and from it to go up to Heaven (as in Chri$ts return
<marg><I>Chri$t in his
Incarnation tru-
ly de$cended from
Heaven, and in
his A$cen$ion tru-
ly a$cended into
Heaven.</I></marg>
to Heaven in his Glorious A$cention) is truly and properly to
<I>De$cend</I> from the Circumference to the Centre, and to <I>a$cend</I>
from the parts which are neare$t to the Centre of the World
to its utmo$t Circumference. This Maxim therefore may ea$ily
and according to truth explain Theologicall Propo$itions: and
this is $o much the more confirmed, in that (as I have ob$erved)
almo$t all Texts of Sacred Scripture which oppo$e the Earth to
Heaven, are mo$t conveniently and aptly under$tood of the Em-
pyrial Heaven (being the Highe$t of all the Heavens, and Spiritual
in re$pect of its end) but not of the inferiour or intermediate Hea-
vens, which are a Corporeal, and were framed for the benefit of
Corporeal Creatures: and thus when in the Plural Number
Heavens are mentioned, then all the Heavens promi$cuou$ly and
without di$tinction are to be under$tood, as well the Empyrian
it $elf as the Inferiour Heavens. And this Expo$ition indeed any
man (that doth but take notice of it) may find to be mo$t true.
And $o for this Rea$on the Third Heaveu into which St. <I>Paul</I>

was wrapt up, by this Maxim may be taken for the Empyrean:
if for the the Fir$t Heaven we under$tand that immen$e Space of
Erratick and Moveable Bodies illuminated by the Sun, in which
are comprehended the Planets, as al$o the Earth moveable, and
the Sun immoveable, Who like a King upon his Augu$t Tribu-
nal, $its with venerable Maje$ty immoveable and con$tant in
Centre of all the Sph&aelig;res, and, with his Divine Beames, doth
bountifully exhilerate all C&oelig;le$tial Bodies that $tand in need of
his vital Light, for which they cravingly wander about him; and
doth liberally and on every $ide comfort and illu$trate the Thea-
tre of the whole World, and all its parts, even the very lea$t, like
an immortal and perpetual Lamp of high and un$peakable va-
lue. The Second Heaven $hall be the Starry Heaven, common-
ly called the Eighth Sph&aelig;re, or the Firmament, wherein are all
the Fixed Starrs, which according to this Opinion of <I>Pythagoras,</I>
is (like as the Sun and Centre) void of all Motion, the Centre
and utmo$t Circumference mutually agreeing with each other in
<foot>Rrr Immobility</foot>
<p n=>498</p>
Immobility. And the Third $hall be the Empyrean Heaven, that
is the Seat of the Ble$$ed. And in this manner we may come to

<I>(a) All things are about the King of all things, Second things
about the $econd, and Third things about the Third</I>: For that
God being the Centre of Spiritual things, the Sun, of Cor-
poreal, Chri$t, of tho$e that are Mixt, or made up of both, things
do doubtle$$e depend of that of the$e three Centres that is mo$t
corre$pondent and proportionable to them, and the Centre is
ever adjudged to be the nobler and worthier place: and therefore
in Animals the Heart, in Vegitables the Pith or Kernell wherein
the Seed lyeth that con$erveth their perpetuity, and virtually in-
cludes the whole Plant, are in the Mid$t, and in the Centre: and
thus much $hall $uffice to have hinted at, $ince there may another
occa$ion offer it $elf for a larger Explication of the$e things. By
this Maxim the Authorities and Arguments of the Third Fourth
and Fifth Cla$$es are re$olved.</P>
<P>It may be added withall, that even the <I>Sun, Mercury</I> and <I>Ve-
nus</I> (that is to $ay in re$pect of the Earth) are to be thought
<I>aboue,</I> and not <I>beneath</I> the Earth it $elf, although in re$pect of
the Univer$e, yea and al$o ab$olutely, they are <I>below.</I> The rea-
$on is, becau$e in re$pect of the Earth they alwayes appear above
its Surface: and although they do not environe it, yet by the
Motion of the $aid Earth they behold one while one part, another
while another part of its Circumference. Since therefore tho$e
things which in a Sph&aelig;rical Body are nearer to the Circumfe-
rence and more remote from the Cenrre are $aid to be <I>above,</I> but
tho$e that are next adjoyning to the Centre are $aid to be <I>below</I>;
it clearly followeth that whil$t the <I>Sun, Mercury</I> and <I>Venus</I> are
not only turned towards the Surface and Circumference of the
$aid Earth, but are at a very great di$tance without it, $ucce$$ively
turned about it, and every way have a view of it, and are very
far remote from its Centre, they may, in re$pect of the $aid Earth,
be $aid to be <I>above</I> it; as al$o on the other $ide, the Earth in
re$pect of them may be $aid to be <I>beneath</I>: howbeit on the con-
trary, in re$pect of the Univer$e, the Earth in reality is much
higher than they. And thus is $alved the Authority of <I>Eccle$i-</I>

true Sen$e wherein it is $aid, That we are <I>under the Sun,</I> and <I>un-

name of <I>Sublunary.</I></P>
<P>The Sixth Cla$$is threatneth a difficulty which is common as
<foot>well</foot>
<p n=>499</p>
well to this of <I>Copernicus,</I> as to the Vulgar Opinion; $o that they
are both alike concerned in the $olution of it: But $o far as it
oppo$eth that of <I>Copernicus,</I> its an$wer is ea$y from the Fir$t
Maxim.</P>
<P>But that which is added in the Fourth Cla$$e, That it follow-
eth from this Opinion, that Hell (for that it is included by the
Earth, as is commonly held) doth move circularly about the
Sun, and in Heaven, and that $o Hell it $elf will be found to be
in Heaven; di$covers, in my judgment, nothing but Ignorance
and Calumny, that in$inuate the belief of their Arguments ra-
ther by a corrupt $en$e of the Words, than by $olid Rea$ons
taken from the bo$ome of the Nature of things. For in this
place Heaven is no wi$e to be taken for Paradice, nor according
to the Sen$e of Common Opinion, but (as hath been $aid above)
<marg><I>Heaven accord-
ing to Copernicus
is the $ame with
the mo$t tenuous
&AElig;ther; but dif-
ferent from Para<*>
dice, which $ar-
pa$$eth all the
Heavens.</I></marg>
according to the <I>Copernican</I> Hypothe$is, for the $ubtile$t and
Pure$t Aire, far more tenuous and rare than this of ours; where-
upon the Solid Bodies of the Stars, Moon, and Earth, in their
Circular and Ordinary Motions, do pa$$e thorow it, (the Sph&aelig;re
of Fire being by this Opinion taken away.) And as according
to the Common Opinion it was no ab$urdity to $ay, That Hell
being demerged in the Centre of the Earth and of the World it
$elf, hath Heaven and Paradice above and below it, yea and on
all $ides of it, and that it is in the middle of all the C&oelig;le$tial
Bodies (as if it were po$ited in a more unworthy place) $o, nei-
ther in this will it be deemed an Error, if from the other Sy$tem,
which differeth not much from the Vulgar one, tho$e or the like
things follow as do in that. For both in that of <I>Copernicus,</I> and
the Vulgar Hypothe$is, Hell is $uppo$ed to be placed among$t the
very dreggs of the Elements, and in the Centre of the Earth it
$elf, for the confinement and puni$hment of the damned. There-
fore we ought not for want of Rea$ons to trifle away time in
vain and impertinent $trife about words, $ince their true Sen$e
is clouded then with no ob$curity, and in regard that it is very
clear to any man indued with a refined Intellect, and that hath
but an indifferent judgment in the Liberal Arts, and e$pecially
in the Mathematicks, that the $ame, or not very different Gon-
$equences do flow from both the$e Opinions.</P>
<P>By the$e Maxims and their Interpretations it appears, that
the <I>Pythagorick</I> and <I>Copernican</I> Opinion is $o probable, that its
po$$ible it may exceed even the <I>Ptolemaick</I> in probability; and
$ince there may be deduced from it a mo$t ordinate Sy$teme, and
a mroe admirable and my$terious Hypothe$is of the World
than from that of <I>Ptolomy:</I> the Authorities of Sacred Scripture
and Theological Tenents in the mean while not oppo$ing it, be-
ing opportunely and appo$itely (as I have $hown how they may
<foot>Rrr 2 be)</foot>
<p n=>500</p>
be) reconciled with it: And $ince that by it not only the Ph&oelig;-
nomena of all the C&oelig;le$tial Bodies are mo$t readily $alved, but
al$o many Natural Rea$ons are di$covered, which could not o-
therwi$e, (but with extream difficulty) have been found out:
And $ince it, la$t of all, doth open a more ea$y way into A$tro-
nomy and Phylo$ophy, and rejecteth all tho$e $uperfluous and
imaginary inventions produced by A$tronomers to the end only,
that they might be able by them to render a rea$on of the $o ma-
ny and $o various Motions of the C&oelig;le$tial Orbs.</P>
<P>And who knows, but that in that admirable compo$ure of the
Candle$tick which was to be placed in the Tabernacle of God, he
might out of his extraordinary love to us have been plea$ed to
$haddow forth unto us the Sy$teme of the Univer$e, and more

Text proceeds to the de$cription of the Bowls, the Knops, and
the Flowers, $aying, <I>(f) Three Bowls made like unto Almonds,
with a Knop and a Flower in one Branch; and three Bowls made
like Almonds in the other Branch, with a Knop and a Flower: this
$hall be the work of the $ix Branches that come out of the Shaft.
And in the Candle$tick $hall be four Bowls made like unto Al-
monds, with their Knops and their Flowers: there $hall be a knop
under two branches of the $ame, and a Knop under two Branches
of the $ame, and a Knop under two Branches of the $ame; which
together are $ix Branches, proceeding from one Shaft.</I> The truth
<marg>(f) <I>ver$.</I> 33, 34.</marg>
is, the $hallowne$$e of my under$tanding cannot fathome the
<foot>depth</foot>
<p n=>501</p>
depth of all the My$teries that are couched in this mo$t wi$e
di$po$ure of things: neverthele$$e being amazed, and tran$ported
with admiration, I will $ay; Who knows but that tho$e three
Bowls like unto Almonds to be repre$ented on each of the
Branches of the Candle$tick may $ignifie tho$e Globes which are
apter (as is this our Earth) for the receiving than emitting of Influ-
ences? Perhaps al$o they denote tho$e Globes of late di$covered
by the help of the Optick Tele$cope, which participate with
<I>Saturn, Jupiter, Venus,</I> and po$$ibly al$o with the other Planets?
Who knows likewi$e, but that there may be $ome occult propor-
tion between the$e Globes and tho$e My$terious Knops and
Lilies in$inuated unto us in the $acred Scriptures? But this
$hall here $uffice to bound humane Pre$umption, and to teach us
to ex$pect with an Harpocratick $ilence from Time, the Indice of
Truth, a di$covery of the$e My$teries: <I>(g) Solomon</I> made ten

Candle$ticks by the $ame Patern of <I>Mo$es,</I> which he placed, five
on one hand and five on another, in the Temple erected by him
in honour of the mo$t High God; which very thing doth al$o,
without all que$tion, contain mo$t ab$tru$e $igni$ications. More-
over, that Apple of the Knowledg of Good and Evil prohibited
our fir$t Parents by God is not without a My$tery; which $ome
$ay was an Indian Figg. In which the$e things are to be ob$erv-
ed: Fir$t, That it is replete with many Kernels, every one of
which hath a particular Centre. Secondly, Though of it $elf it
be hard and $olid, yet about its Circumference it is of a more rare
and tenuou$e $ub$tance; herein re$embling the Earth, which
though in its Centre, and tho$e parts which are neare$t to it, it
be $tony, Metallick, and compact, yet the nearer one approacheth
to the Circumference, its parts are $een to be the more rare and
tenuou$e: and withall it hath another body, more rare than its
own, namely the Water, above which there is yet another, more
$ubtil than all the re$t of inferiour Bodyes, that is to $ay,
the Aire,</P>
<P>The $ame Repre$entation with that of the Indian Figg is held
forth to us by the <I>Malum Punicum,</I> or Pomegranate, with its
innumerable poly centrick Stones or Kernels, all which in the parts
more remote from their Centre, and nearer approaching towards
the Circumference, are of a $ub$tance $o $ubtil and rare, that being
but lightly compre$$ed, they in a manner wholly convert into a
mo$t tenuo$e Liquor or juice: Of which fruit it plea$ed Divine
Wi$dom to make mention, and ordained that its Figure $hould be
imbroidered and wrought with a needle in the <I>$acerdotal</I> Garment

$piration the <I>(q)</I> Chapiters of the Pillars were adorned with $eve-
ral rowes of Pomegranates: which particular is mentioned, not
in one but many places of Holy Writ. Yea and $ometimes acci-
dentally and occa$ionally the Holy hath Gho$t &aelig;nigmatically re-
pre$ented this mo$t admirable and Mo$t Wi$e Sructure of the
World, the Order of the Heavens, and the di$po$ure of Crea-
tures Spiritual and Corporeal by Emblems, Parables, and Figures,
lea$t they $hould be as it were dazled and blinded, by the reful-
gent $plendor of $o excellent an Object. Hence we $ee, that in
the$e Doctrinal &amp; Dubious Points we may di$cour$e in $uch man-
ner by help of the Holy Scripture as is meet for the under$tanding
of the Prophets; which $eeing they are very ob$cure, they $hall be
fully under$tood, and may be aptly applyed only then when they
$hall be fulfilled, and not before: So al$o when once the true
Sy$teme of the Univer$e is found out, then, and not till then, the
meaning of the$e Figures, and &AElig;nigma's $hall be made known
unto us: Thus before the coming of the Son of God had di$co-
vered unto us the My$tery of the Holy Trinity, none were able
to comprehend or imagine what was concealed under tho$e
<foot>words</foot>
<p n=>503</p>
words; <I>(r) In Principio creavit Elohim C&oelig;lum &amp; Terram:</I> for
<marg><I>(r)</I> Gen. c. 1. v. 1</marg>
that they did not $ee how the Noun Plural <I>Elohim</I> (which is as much
as to $ay <I>Dij,</I> [Gods] $hould be joyned with the Verb Singular,
<I>Creavit</I>: But the My$tery of the Unity of E$$ence and Trinity
of Per$ons in God being revealed, it was pre$ently known, that
the Singular Number, <I>Creavit,</I> had reference to the Unity of E$-
$ence, (in regard that the Works of the Trinity <I>ad extra</I> are in-
divi$ible) and the Plural, <I>Elohim,</I> to the Per$ons. Who, I pray,
in elder times could have found out this My$tery? And thus the
Name of God is thrice repeated in <I>P$al. 67. (s) God, even our</I>
<marg><I>(s) P</I>$al. 67. v. 6
7.</marg>
<I>God $hall ble$$e us, God $hall ble$$e us, &amp;c.</I> Which at fir$t might
$eem a Pleona$me, and $uperfluous repetition; but afterwards it
was evident that <I>David</I> did there $et out the Benedictions of $e-
veral Per$ons implyed, to wit, the Father, Son, and Holy Gho$t.
Innumerable Examples of the like kind may be found in the Sa-
cred Leaves. Therefore, to conclude, I will $ay with ^{*}<I>David,</I>

<head>AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
Authour and Work.</head>
<P>DON BENEDETTO CASTELLI,
<I>the famous Authour of the$e en$uing
Di$cour$es of the</I> Men$uration of
Running Waters, <I>is de$cended from
the Wor$hipful FAMILY of the</I>
GASTELLII, <I>and took his
fir$t breath near to the lake THR A-
SIMENVS, (where</I> Hanibal <I>gave
a fatal overthrow to the</I> Roman
<I>Legions) in that $weet and fertile part
of happy</I> ITALY, <I>called the</I> Territory
<I>of</I> PERUGIA, <I>a branch of the Dukedome of</I> TUSCANY, <I>which
at pre$ent $ubmitteth to the Juri$diction of the Church, as being a
part of</I> St. PETER'S Patrimony. <I>His Parents, who were more
zealous of the good of his Soul than ob$ervant of the Propen$ion of
his Genius, dedicated him (according to the Devotion of that Coun-
try) to the Service of the Church; and entered him into the Flou-
ri$hing Order of Black-Friers, called from the place Moncks
of</I> Monte Ca$ino, <I>and from the Founder</I> Benedictines. <I>Na-
ture, that She might con$ummate the Profu$ion of her Fa-
vours upon him, $ent him into the World in an Age that was $o
ennobled and illuminated with Eminent Scholars in all Kinds of
Literature, that hardly any Century $ince the Creation can boa$t
the like.</I></P>
<foot>&sect;. <I>In</I></foot>
<pb>
<P>&sect;. <I>In particular, the</I> SCIENCES MATHEMATI-
CAL <I>had then got that Fame and E$teem in the Learned World,
that all men of Spirit or Quality became either Students in, or
Patrons of tho$e Sublime Knowledges. On this occa$ion the Curi-
o$ity of our</I> AUTHOUR <I>being awakened, his Active Wit
could not endure to be any longer confined to the Slavi$h Tuition
of Hermetical Pedagogues; but in concurrence with the Genius
of the Age, he al$o betook him$elf to tho$e mo$t Generous and
Liberal Studies. His helps in this his de$ign were $o many, and
$o extraordinary, that had his Inclination been weaker, or his
Apprehen$ion le$$er, he could hardly have failed attaining more
than a Common Eminency in the$e Sciences. For be$ides the De-
luge of Learned and V$eful Books, which the Pre$$e at that
time $ent forth from all parts of</I> EUROPE, <I>he had the good
Fortune to fall into the Acquaintance, and under the In$truction
of the mo$t Demon$trative and mo$t Familiar Man in the World,
the Famous</I> GALILEO<I>: who$e $ucce$$e being no le$$e upon
this his</I> Pupil <I>than upon the re$t of tho$e Illu$trious and Ingeni-
ous Per$ons that re$orted from all parts to $it under his Admi-
rable Lectures, he in a $hort time attained to that Name in the
Mathematicks, that he was invited to</I> ROME, <I>Complemen-
ted, and Preferred by his then Holine$$e the Eighth</I> URBAN,
<I>upon his very fir$t Acce$$ion to the</I> Papacy, <I>which was in the
Year</I> 1623.</P>
<P>&sect;. <I>This Pope being moved with a Paternal Providence for the
Concerns of his Subjects in that part of</I> ITALY <I>about</I> BO-
LOGNA, FERRARA, <I>and</I> COMMACHIO, <I>ly-
ing between the Rivers of</I> PO <I>and</I> RENO, <I>which is part of</I>
Lo Stato della Chie$a, <I>or the Church Patrimony, appoints this
our</I> CASTELLI <I>in the Year 1625, to accompany the Right
Honourable</I> Mon$ignore GORSINI <I>(a mo$t ob$ervant and
intelligent per$on in the$e affaires, and at that time Superinten-
dent of the General Draines, and Pre$ident of</I> ROMAGNA)
<I>in the Grand Vi$itation which he was then ordered to make con-
cerning the di$orders occa$ioned by the Waters of tho$e parts.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. CASTELLI, <I>having now an Opportunity to employ,
yea more, to improve $uch Notions as he had imbued from the
Lectures of his Excellent</I> MASTER, <I>falls to his work with
all indu$try: and in the time that his Occa$ions detained him in</I>
ROMAGNA <I>he perfected the Fir$t Book of this his Di$-
cour$e concerning the</I> Men$uration of Running Waters. <I>He con-
fe$$eth that he had $ome years before applyed him$elf to this part
of Practical Geometry, and from $everal Ob$ervations collected
part of that Doctrine which at this time he put into Method, and
which had procured him the Repute of $o much Skill that he began</I>
<foot><I>to</I></foot>

<I>to be Courted by $undry Princes, and great Prelates. In particu-
lar about the beginning of the Year 1623. and before his Invita-
tion to</I> ROME <I>he was employed by Prince</I> Ferdinando I, <I>Grand
Duke of</I> TUSCANY, <I>to remedy the Di$orders which at that
time happened in the Valley of</I> PISA <I>in the Meadows that lye
upon the Banks of</I> Serchio <I>and</I> Fiume Morto: <I>and in the pre-
$ence of the Grand Duke, Grand Dutche$$e Mother, the Commi$-
$ioners of Sewers, and $undry other Per$ons in a few hours he
made $o great a progre$$e in that affair, as gave his Mo$t Serene
Highne$$e high $atisfaction, and gained him$elf much Honour.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>No $ooner had he in his fore-mentioned Voiage to</I> RO-
MAGNA <I>(which was but few Moneths after, in the $ame
Year) committed his Conceptions to paper, but he communicated
them to certain of his Friends. In which number we finde</I> Signo-
re Ciampoli <I>Secretary of the Popes Private Affaires; whom in
the beginning of the Fir$t Book he gratefully acknowledgeth to
have been contributary, in his Pur$e, towards defraying the
charge of Experiments, and in his Per$on, towards the debating
and compleating of Arguments upon this Subject. Some few years
after the Importunity of Friends, and the Zeal he had for the
Publique Good prevailed with him to pre$ent the World with his
Fir$t Di$cour$e, accompanied with a Treati$e of the Geometrical
Demon$trations of his whole Doctrine. What Reception it found
with the Judicious mu$t needs be imagined by any one that hath
ob$erved how</I> Novelty <I>and</I> Facility <I>in conjunction with</I> Verity
<I>make a Charm of irre$i$table Operation.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. New <I>it was, for that no man before him had ever attemp-
ted to Demon$trate all the three Dimen$ions, to wit, the Length,
Breadth and Profundity, of this Fluid and Current Ele-
ment. And he detecteth $uch gro$$e Errours in tho$e few that
had untertook to write upon the Subject (of which he in$tan-
ceth in</I> Frontinus <I>and</I> Fontana, <I>as tho$e that include the rest)
and delivereth $uch $ingular and unheard-of Paradoxes (for $o
they $ound in Vulgar Eares) as cannot but procure un$peakable
delight to his Reader.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. Eafie <I>it is likewi$e and</I> True; <I>and that upon $o Familiar
Experiments and Manife$t Demon$trations, that I have oft que-
$tioned with my $elf which merited the greater wonder, he, for
di$covering, or all men that handled the Argument before him
for not di$covering a Doctrine of $uch $trange Facility and Infal-
libility. But yet as if our Authour de$igned to oblige the whole
World to him by $o excellent a</I> Pre$ent, <I>he $elects a Subject that
he knew would be carre$$ed by all per$ons of Nobler Souls, upon
the accounts afore-named, and by all Mankind in General, as
gratifying them in their much adored Idol</I> Utility. <I>And to ren-</I>
<foot><I>der</I></foot>
<pb>
<I>der his Art the more profitable, he reduceth the lofty, and ea$ie-to-
be-mi$taken Speculations of the Theory, into certain and facile
Directions for Practice; teaching us how to prevent and repaire
the Breaches of Seas, and Inundations of Rivers; to draine
and recover Fenns and Marches; to divert, conveigh and di-
$tribute Waters for the Flowing and Stercoration of Grounds,
$trengthening of Fortifications, $erving of Aquaducts, pre$er-
ving of Health (by clean$ing Streets, and $cowring Sewers) and
maintaining of Commer$e (by defending Bridges, cleering Ri-
vers, and opening Ports and Channels) with innumerable other
Benefits of the like nature. And, that I may omit no circum$tance
that may recommend my Authour, the Fortune of this his Trea-
ti$e hath been $uch, that as if he intended a</I> Plus ultra <I>by it,
or as if all men de$paired to out-do it, or la$tly, as if</I> CA-
STELLI <I>hath been $o great a</I> Ma$ter <I>that none have pre$u-
med to take Pencil in hand for the fini$hing of what he</I> Pour-
foild, <I>this $mall Tract like the Arabian Ph&oelig;nix (of which it is
$aid</I> Unica $emper Avis) <I>did for $everal years together continue
$ingle in the World, till that to verifie it to be truly</I> Ph&oelig;nician,
<I>it renewed its Age by undergoing a $econd Impre$$ion. And as if
this did not make out the Immortal vertue of it, it hath had</I>
Anno 1660 <I>a third Circulation, and ri$en in this la$t Edition as
it were from the Vrne of its Authour; and that $o improved by
the Addition of a $econd part, that it promi$eth to perpetuate
his Merits to all Po$terity. To be brief, the meer Fame of this
Work re$ounded the Honourable Name of</I> CASTELLI <I>in-
to all the Corners of</I> Italy, <I>I may $ay of</I> Europe; <I>in$omuch,
that, in hopes to reap great benefit by his Art, the re$pective
Grandees of the adjacent Countries courted his Judgment and
Advice about their Draining of Fenns, Diver$ion of Rivers,
Evacuation of Ports, Preventing of Inundations, &amp;c. So that
every Summer he made one or more of the$e Journies or Vi$itati-
ons. Particularly, the Senate of</I> Venice <I>con$ulted him about their
Lake; to whom he delivered his Opinion in</I> May 1641. <I>and up-
on farther thoughts he pre$ented them with another Paper of Con-
$iderations the</I> 20 December <I>following. Prince</I> LEOPOLDO
<I>of</I> TUSCANY <I>likewi$e reque$ted his Advice in the begin-
ning of the en$uing year 1642, which occa$ioned his Letter to
Father</I> France$co di San Giu$eppe, <I>bearing date</I> February 1,
<I>To which</I> Signore Bartolotti <I>oppo$ing, he writes a $econd Let-
ter, directed to one of the Commi$$ioners of Sewers, vindicating
his former, and refuting</I> Bartolotti, <I>both which I here give
you.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>The Preferments which his Merits recommended him unto,
were fir$t to be Abbot of</I> Ca$$ino, <I>from which he was removed</I>
<foot>Anno</foot>
<pb>
Anno 1640, <I>or thereabouts, unto the Abbey of</I> Santo Benedet-
to Aloy$io; <I>and much about the $ame time preferred to the Dig-
nity of Chief Mathematician to his grand Patron Pope</I> URBAN
VIII. <I>and Publique Profe$$our of Mathematicks in the Vni-
ver$ity of</I> ROME.</P>
<P>&sect;. <I>Here a Stop was put to the Carier of his Fortunes, and be-
ing fuller of Honour than of Years, was by Death, the Importu-
nate Intrerupter of Generous De$igns, prevented in doing that
farther Good which the World had good rea$on to promi$e it $elf
from $o Profound and Indu$trious a Per$onage, leaving many
Friends and Di$ciples of all Degrees and Qualities to lament
his lo$$e, and honour his Memory.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>His $ingular Virtues and Abilities had gained him the
Friend$hip of very many; as to in$tance in $ome, he had con-
racted $trict Amity with</I> Mon$ignore Maffei Barberino <I>a Floren-
tine, Pr&aelig;fect of the Publique Wayes, and afterwards Pope with
the Name of</I> URBAN VIII. <I>as was $aid before; with the
above-named</I> Mon$ignore Cor$ini <I>Superintendant of the General
Draines: with</I> Mon$ignore Piccolomini <I>Arch-Bi$hop of</I> Siena<I>:
with Cardinal</I> Serra: <I>with Cardinal</I> Caponi, <I>who hath $tudied
much and writ well upon this Subject; and with Cardinal</I> Gae-
tano <I>who frequently con$ulted with him in his de$ign of Drain-
ing the Fenns of</I> ROMAGNA. <I>Moreover Prince</I> LEO-
POLDO, <I>and his Brother the Grand Duke had very great
kindne$$e for him; which $peaks no $mall attractions in him,
con$idering him as a favourite of the Family of</I> Barberini, <I>be-
tween whom and the Hou$e of</I> Medeci <I>there is an inveterate
Fewd. Among$t per$ons of a lower Quality he acknowledgeth</I>
Signore Ciampoli <I>the Popes Secretary,</I> Sig. Ferrante Ce$arini,
Sig. Giovanni Ba$adonna <I>Senator of</I> Venice; <I>and I find menti-
oned</I> Sig. Lana, Sig. Albano, Padre Serafino, Pad. France$co
de San. Giu$eppe, <I>and many others.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>The Works in which he will $urvive to all $ucceeding Ages
are fir$t His $olid and $ober Confutation of the Arguments of</I>
Signore Lodovico dell Columbo, <I>and</I> Signore Vincentio di
Gratia <I>again$t the Tract of</I> Galileo Delle co$e che $tanno $opra
Aqua, <I>wherein he vindicates bis $aid</I> Ma$ter <I>with a Gratitude
that Tutors very rarely reap from the pains they take in Culti-
vating their Pupils. This Apology was fir$t Printed</I> Anno 1615.
<I>and was a $econd time publi$hed, as al$o tho$e of his Antago-
ni$ts, among$t the Works of</I> GALILEO, <I>$et forth by the
Learned</I> Viviani 1656. <I>He hath likewi$e writ $everal other
curious Pieces, as I am informed by the mo$t Courteous</I> Carolo
Manole$$i <I>of</I> Bologna; <I>among$t others an excellent Treati$e
concerning</I> Colours, <I>which he putteth me in hopes to $ee printed</I>

<I>very $peedily. And la$t of all the$e Di$cour$es and Reflections
upon the</I> Men$uration of Running Waters, <I>with the addition of
a Second Book, three Epi$tles, and four Con$iderations upon
the $ame Argument, which conduce much to Illu$trate his Do-
ctrine and Facilitate the Practice of it; and which with a Rela-
tion of</I> Mon$ignore Cor$ini, <I>make the $econd part of my Fir$t
Tome.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>I might here $ally forth into the Citation of $undry Au-
thours of Good Account, that have tran$mitted his Character
to Po$terity, but $hall confine my $elf to onely two; the one is
of his</I> Ma$ter, <I>the other of his</I> Scholar; <I>than whom there can-
not be two more competent Judges of his Accompli$hments. To

<P>&sect;. <I>I have onely two particulars more to offer the Engli$h Rea-
der: The one concerns the Book, and it is this, That after the
general Aprobation it hath had in</I> Italy, <I>I cannot but think it
de$erveth the $ame Civil Entertainment with us, in regard that
it cometh with no le$$e</I> Novelty, Facility, Verity, and Utility <I>to
us than to tho$e whom the Authour favoured with the Original.
Our Rivers and Sewers through Publique Di$tractions and Pri-
vate Incroachments are in great di$order, as tho$e Channels for
iu$tance which formerly were Navigable unto the very Walls of</I>
<foot>York</foot>
<pb>
York <I>and</I> Salisbury, <I>&amp;c: Our Ports are choaked and ob$tructed
by Shelfes and Setlements: Our Fenns do in a great part lie wa$te
and unimproved: Now all the$e may be (and, as I find by the
Confe$$ion of $ome who$e Practi$es upon the Copy of the Fir$t
Book onely of our Authour hath got them both Money and Repu-
tation, in part have been) remedied by the Ways and Means he
here $ets down. The truth is the Argument hath been pa$t over
with an Vniver$al Silence; $o that to this day I have not $een
any thing that hath been written Demon$tratively and with Ma-
thematical Certainty concerning the $ame, $ave onely what this
Learned Prelate hath delivered of his Own Invention in the$e
Treati$es: who yet hath $o fully and plainly handled the Whole
Doctrine, that I may affirm his Work to be every way ab$olute. It
mu$t be confe$t the Demon$tration of the Second Propo$ition of the
Second Book did not well plea$e the Authour, and had he lived
he would have $upplyed that defect, but being prevented by
Death, the Reader mu$t content him$elf with the Mechanical
Proof that he giveth you of the truth of $o Excellent a Con-
clu$ion.</I></P>
<P>&sect;. <I>The other particular that I am to offer is, that out of my de-
$ire to contribute what lyeth in me to the compleating of this Piece
for Engli$h Practice, I have exeeded my promi$e not onely in gi-
ving you the Second and following Books which were not extant at
the time of tendring my Overtures, but al$o in that I have added
a Map or Plat of all the Rivers, Lakes, Fenns, &amp;c. mentioned
thorow out the Work. And if I have not kept touch in point of
Time, let it be con$idered that I am the Tran$lator and not the
Printer. To conclude, according to your acceptance of the$e my
endeavours, you may expect $ome other Tracts of no le$$e Profit
and Delight.</I> Farewell.</P>

<head>OF THE
MENSURATION
OF
Running Waters.</head>
<head><I>LIB.</I> I.</head>
<P>What, and of how great moment the confi-
deration of <I>Motion</I> is in natural things,
is $o manife$t, that the Prince of <I>Peri-
pateticks</I> pronounced that in his Schools
now much u$ed Sentence: <I>Ignorato mo-
tu, ignoratur natura.</I> Thence it is that
true Philo$ophers have $o travailed in the
contemplation of the Cele$tial motions,
and in the $peculation of the motions of
Animals, that they have arrived to a wonderful height and $ub-
limity of under$tanding. Under the $ame Science of <I>Motion</I>
is comprehended all that which is written by Mechanitians con-
cerning Engines moving of them$elves, <I>Machins</I> moving by the
force of Air, and tho$e which $erve to move weights and im-
men$e magnitudes with $mall force. There appertaineth to the
Science of <I>Motion</I> all that which hath been written of the
alteration not onely of Bodies, but of our Minds al$o; and
in $um, this ample matter of <I>Motion</I> is $o extended and di-
lated, that there are few things which fall under mans no-
tice, which are not conjoyned with <I>Motion,</I> or at lea$t de-
pending thereupon, or to the knowledge thereof directed;
and of almo$t every of them, there hath been written and
compo$ed by $ublime wits, learned Treati$es and In$tructions.
<foot>Bbbb And</foot>
<p n=>2</p>
And becau$e that in the years pa$t I had occa$ion by Order of
our Lord Pope <I>Vrban</I> 8. to apply my thoughts to the motion of
the Waters of Rivers, (a matter difficult, mo$t important, and
little handled by others) having concerning the $ame ob$erved
$ome particulars not well ob$erved, or con$idered till now, but of
great moment both in publick and private affairs; I have thought
good to publi$h them, to the end that ingenious $pirits might
have occa$ion to di$cu$$e more exactly then hitherto hath been
done, $o nece$$ary and profitable a matter, and to $upply al$o my
defects in this $hort and difficult Tractate. Difficult I $ay, for
the truth is, the$e knowledges, though of things next our $en$es,
are $ometimes more ab$truce and hidden, then the knowledge of
things more remote; and much better, and with greater exqui$it-
ne$s are known the motions of the Planets, and Periods of the
Stars, than tho$e of Rivers and Seas: As that $ingular light of
Philo$ophie of our times, and my Ma$ter <I>Signore Galileo Galilei</I>
wi$ely ob$erveth in his Book concerning the Solar $pots. And
to proceed with a due order in Sciences, I will take $ome $uppo-
$itions and cognitions $ufficiently clear; from which I will after-
wards proceed to the deducing of the principal conclu$ions. But
to the end that what I have written at the end of this di$cour$e in
a demon$trative and Geometrical method, may al$o be under-
$tood of tho$e which never have applyed their thoughts to the
$tudy of Geometry; I have endeavoured to explain my conceit
by an example, and with the con$ideration of the natural things
them$elves, mu$t after the $ame order in which I began to doubt
in this matter; and have placed this particular Treati$e here in
the beginning, adverting neverthele$s, that he who de$ires more
full and ab$olute $olidity of Rea$ons, may overpa$s this prefatory
di$cour$e, and onely con$ider what is treated of in the demon$tra-
tions placed towards the end, and return afterwards to the con$i-
deration of the things collected in the <I>Corollaries</I> and Appendices;
which demon$trations notwith$tanding, may be pretermitted by
him that hath not $een at lea$t the fir$t $ix Books of the Elements
of Euclid; $o that he diligently ob$erveth that which fol-
loweth.</P>
<P>I $ay therefore, that having in times pa$t, on divers occa$i-
ons heard $peak of the mea$ures of the waters of Rivers, and
Fountains, $aying, $uch a River is two or three thou$and feet of
water; $uch a $pring-water is twenty, thirty, or forty inches, <I>&amp;c.</I>
Although in $uch manner I have found all to treat thereof in
word and writing, without variety, and as we are wont to $ay,
<I>con$tanti $ermone,</I> yea even Arti$ts and Ingeneers, as if it were
a thing that admitted not of any doubt, yet how$oever I re-
mained $till infolded in $uch an ob$curity, that I well knew I un-
<foot>der$tood</foot>
<p n=>3</p>
der$tood nothing at all, of that which others pretended full and
clearly to under$tand. And my doubt aro$e from my frequent
ob$ervation of many Trenches and Channels, which carry
water to turn Mills, in which Trenches, and Channels, the
water being mea$ured, was found pretty deep; but if afterwards
the $ame water was mea$ured in the fall it made to turn the
Wheel of the Mill, it was much le$$e, not amounting often to the
tenth part, nor $ometimes to the twentieth, in$omuch, that the
$ame running water came to be one while more, another while le$s
in mea$ure, in divers parts of its Channel; and for that rea$on this
vulgar manner of mea$uring running Waters, as indeterminate and
uncertain, was by me ju$tly $u$pected, the mea$ure being to be de-
terminate, and the $ame. And here I freely confe$$e that I had fin-
gular help to re$olve this difficulty from the excellent &amp; accurate
way of di$cour$ing, as in allother matters, $o al$o in this, of the
Right Honourable and Truly Noble Signior <I>Ciampoli,</I> Secretary
of the Popes $ecret affairs. Who moreover, not $paring $or the co$ts
of the $ame, generou$ly gave me occa$ion a few years pa$t to try by
exact experiments that which pa$t concerning this particular. And
to explain all more clearly with an example; we $uppo$e a Ve$$el
filled with Water, as for in$tance a Butt, which is kept full, though
$till water runneth out, and the Water run out by two Taps equal
of bigne$$e, one put in the bottom of the Ve$$el, and the other in
the upper part; it is manife$t that in the time wherein from the
upper part $hall i$$ue a determinate mea$ure of water $rom
the inferiour part there $hall i$$ue four, five, and many more of
the $ame mea$ures, according to the difference of the height of
the Taps, and the di$tance of the upper Tap from the Superfici-
es and level of the water of the Ve$$el: and all this will alwayes
follow, though, as hath been $aid, the Taps be equal, and the
water in di$charging keep the $aid Taps alwayes full. Where fir$t
we note, that, although the mea$ure of the Taps be equal, never-
thele$$e there i$$ueth from them in equal times unequal quantities
of water, And if we $hould more attentively con$ider this bu$i-
ne$$e, we $hould find, that the water by the lower Tap, run-
neth and pa$$eth with much greater velocity, then it doth by the
upper, whatever is the rea$on. If therefore we would have
$uch a quantity of Water di$charge from the upper tap, as
would di$charge from the neather in the $ame time, it is plain, that
either the upper Taps mu$t be multiplyed in $uch $ort, that $o
many more Taps in number be placed above than below, as the
neather tap $hall be more $wift than the upper, or the upper Tap
made $o much bigger than the nether, by how much that be-
neath $hall be more $wift than that above; and $o then in equal
times, the $ame quantity of Water $hall di$charge from the upper,
as doth from the neather part.</P>
<foot>Bbbb 2 I</foot>
<p n=>4</p>
<P>I will declare my $elf by another example. If we $hould ima-
gine, that two cords or lines of equal thickne$s, be drawn through
two holes of equal bore; but $o that the fir$t pa$s with quadruple
velocity to the $econd: It is manife$t, that if in a determinate
time, we $hall by the fir$t bore have drawn four Ells of the line,
in the $ame time, by the $econd hole we $hall have drawn but one
Ell of cord onely; and if by the fir$t there pa$$e twelve Ells, then
through the $econd there $hall pa$$e onely three Ells; and in
$hort the quantity of cord $hall have the $ame proportion to the
cord, that the volocity hath to the velocity. And therefore we
de$iring to compen$ate the tardity of the $econd cord, and main-
taining the $ame tardity to draw through the $econd hole as much
cord as through the fir$t, it will be nece$$ary to draw through the
$econd bore four ends of cord; $o that the thickne$s of all the
cords by the $econd hole, have the $ame proportion to the thick-
ne$s of the cord which pa$$eth onely by the fir$t, as the velocity
of the cord by the fir$t hole hath reciprocally to the velocity of
the codrs by the $econd hole. And thus its clear, that when
there is drawn through two holes equal quantity of cords in
equal time, but with unequal velocity, it will be nece$$ary, that
the thickne$s of all the four cords $hall have the $ame reciprocal
proportion to the thickne$s of the $wifter cord, that the velo-
city of the $wifter cord hath to the velocity of the $lower. The
which is verified likewi$e in the fluid Element of Water.</P>
<P>And to the end that this principal fundamental be well under-
$tood, I will al$o note a certain ob$ervation made my me in the
Art of Wyer-drawing, or $pinning Gold, Silver, Bra$s, and Iron,
and it is this; That $uch Artificers de$iring more and more to
di$gro$$e and $ubtillize the $aid Metals, having would about a
<I>R</I>ocket or Barrel, the thread of the Metal, they place the Roc-
ket in a frame upon a $tedfa$t Axis, in $uch $ort that the Rocket
may turn about in it $elf; then making one end of the thread to
pa$$e by force through a Plate of Steel pierced with divers holes,
greater and le$$er, as need requireth, fa$tning the $ame end of the
thread to another Rocket, they wind up the thread, which pa$-
$ing through a bore le$s than the thickne$$e of the thread, is of
force con$trained to di$gro$$e and $ubtillize. Now that which is
inten$ly to be ob$erved in this bu$ine$s, is this, That the parts of
the thread before the hole, are of $uch a thickne$$e, but the parts
of the $ame thread after it is pa$$ed the hole, are of a le$$er thick-
ne$$e: and yet neverthele$$e the ma$$e and weight of the thread
which is drawn forth, is ever equal to the ma$$e and weight of the
thread which is winded up. But if we $hould well con$ider the mat-
ter, we $hould finde, that the thicker the thread before the hole is,
than the thread pa$$ed the hole, the greater reciprocally is the
<foot>velocity</foot>
<p n=>5</p>
velocity of the parts of the thread pa$$ed the hole, than the volo-
city of the parts before the hole: In$omuch that if <I>verbi gratia</I>
the thickne$$e of the thread before the hole, were double to the
thickne$$e after the hole, in $uch ca$e the velocity of the parts of
the thread pa$$ed the hole, $hould be double to the velocity of the
parts of the thread before the hole; and thus the thickne$$e
compen$ates the velocity, and the velocity compen$ates the thick-
ne$$e. So that the $ame occurreth in the $olid Metals of Gold,
Silver, Bra$s, Iron, &amp;c. that eveneth al$o in the fluid Element of
Water, and other liquids, namely, That the velocity beareth the
$ame proportion to the velocity, that the thickne$$e of the Me-
tal, or Water, hath to the thickne$$e.</P>
<P>And therefore granting this di$cour$e, we may $ay, that as of-
ten as two Taps with different velocity di$charge equal quanti-
ties of Water in equal times, it will be nece$$ary that the Tap
le$$e $wift be $o much greater, and larger, than the Tap more
$wift, by how much the $wifter $uperates in velocity the $lower;
and to pronounce the Propo$ition in more proper terms, we $ay;
That if two Taps of unequal velocity, di$charge in equal times
equal quantities of Water, the greatne$$e of the fir$t $hall be to
the greatne$$e of the $econd, in reciprocal proportion, as the ve-
locity of the $econd to the velocity of the fir$t. As for example,
if the fir$t Tap $hall be ten times $wifter than the $econd Tap, it
will be nece$$ary, that the $econd be ten times bigger and larger
than the fir$t; and in $uch ca$e the Taps $hall di$charge equall
quantities of water in equal times; and this is the principal and
mo$t important point, which ought to be kept alwayes in minde,
for that on it well under$tood depend many things profitable,
and worthy of our knowledge.</P>
<P>Now applying all that hath been $aid neerer to our purpo$e, I
con$ider, that it being mo$t true, that in divers parts of the $ame
River or Current of running water, there doth always pa$$e equal
quantity of Water in equal time (which thing is al$o demon-
$trated in out fir$t Propo$ition) and it being al$o true, that in di-
vers parts the $ame River may have various and different veloci-
ty; it follows of nece$$ary con$equence, that where the River
hath le$$e velocity, it $hall be of greater mea$ure, and in tho$e
parts, in which it hath greater velocity, it $hall be of le$$e mea-
$ure; and in $um, the velocity of $everal parts of the $aid River,
$hall have eternally reciprocall and like proportion with
their mea$ures. This principle and fundamental well e$tabli$h-
ed, that the $ame Current of Water changeth mea$ure, accor-
ding to its varying of velocity; that is, le$$ening the mea$ure,
when the velocity encrea$eth, and encrea$ing the mea$ure, when
the velocity decrea$eth; I pa$$e to the con$ideration of many
<foot>par-</foot>
<p n=>6</p>
particular accidents in this admirable matter, and all depending
on this $ole Propo$ition, the $en$e of which I have oft repeated,
that it might be well under$tood.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> I.</head>
<P>And fir$t, we hence conclude, that the $ame Streams of a
Torrent, namely, tho$e $treams which carry equal quantity of
Water in equal times, make not the $ame depths or mea$ures in
the River, in which they enter, unle$$e when in the entrance in-
to the River they acquire; or to $ay better, keep the $ame velo-
city; becau$e if the velocicities acquired in the River $hall be
different, al$o the mea$ures $hall be diver$e; and con$equently
the depths, as is demon$trated.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> II.</head>
<P>And becau$e $ucce$$ively, as the River is more and more full,
it is con$tituted ordinarily in greater &amp; greater velocity: hence
it is that the $ame $treams of the Torrent, that enter into the Ri-
ver, make le$$e and le$$e depths, as the River grows more and
more full; $ince that al$o the Waters of the Torrent being en-
tered into the River, go acquiring greater and greater velocities,
and therefore dimini$h in mea$ure and height.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> III.</head>
<P>We ob$erve al$o, that while the main River is $hallow, if there
fall but a gentle rain, it $uddenly much increa$eth and ri$eth;
but when the River is already $welled, though there fall again a-
nother new violent $hower, yet it increa$eth not at the $ame rate
as before, proportionably to the rain which fell: which thing
we may affirm particularly to depend on this, that in the fir$t
ca$e, while the River is low, it is found al$o very $low, and there-
fore the little water which entereth into it, pa$$eth and runs with
little velocity, and con$equently occupieth a great mea$ure:
But when the River is once augmented, by new water being al$o
made more $wift, it cau$eth the great Flood of water which fal-
leth, to bear a le$$e mea$ure, and not to make $uch a depth.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> IV.</head>
<P>From the things demon$trated is manife$t al$o, that whil$t a
Torrent entereth into a River, at the time of Ebbe, then the
Torrent moveth with $uch a certain velocity, what ever it be,
<foot>pa$$ing</foot>
<p n=>7</p>
pa$$ing by its extreame$t parts, wherewith it communicateth with
the River; in which parts, the Torrent being mea$ured, $hall
have $uch a certain mea$ure: but the River $welling and ri$ing,
al$o tho$e parts of the Torrent augment in greatne$$e and mea-
$ure, though the Torrent, in that in$tant, di$-imbogue no more
water than it did before: $o that the River being $welled, we
are to con$ider two mouths of the $ame Torrent, one le$$e be-
fore the ri$ing, the other greater after the ri$ing, which mouths
di$charge equal quantities of water in equal times; therefore the
velocity by the le$$er mouth $hall be greater than the velocity by
the greater mouth; and thus the Torrent $hall be retarded from
its ordinary cour$e.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> V.</head>
<P>From which operation of Nature proceedeth another effect
worthy of con$ideration; and it is, that the cour$e of the water
retarding, as hath been $aid in tho$e ultimate parts of the Tor-
rent, if it $hall happen that the Torrent grow torbid and mud-
dy, and its $treame be retarded in $uch a degree, that it is not
able to carry away tho$e minute grains of Earth, which com-
po$e the muddine$$e; in this ca$e the Torrent $hall clear away
the mud, and carry away the Sand at the bottome of its own
Chanel, in the extream parts of its mouth, which rai$ed and
voided Sand, $hall again afterwards be carried away, when the
River abating, the Torrent $hall return to move with its primitive
velocity.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> VI.</head>
<P>Whil$t it is demon$trated, that the $ame water hath different
mea$ures in its Chanel or cour$e, according as it varieth in
velocity; $o that the mea$ure of the water is alwayes greater, where
the velocity is le$$er; and on the contrary, the mea$ure le$$er,
where the velocity is greater: from hence we may mo$t ele-
gantly render the rea$on of the u$ual Proverb, <I>Take heed of the
$till waters:</I> For that if we con$ider the $elf $ame water of a
River in tho$e parts, wherein it is le$s $wift, and thence called <I>$till</I>
or <I>$mooth</I> water, it $hall be, of nece$$ity, of greater mea$ure
than in tho$e parts, in which it is more $wift, and therefore ordi-
narily $hall be al$o more deep and dangerous for pa$$engers;
whence it is well $aid, <I>Take heed of the $till Waters</I>; and this
$aying hath been $ince applied to things moral.</P>
<foot><I>CO.</I></foot>
<p n=>8</p>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> VII.</head>
<P>Likewi$e, from the things demon$trated may be concluded,
that the windes, which $top a <I>R</I>iver, and blowing again$t the
Current, retard its cour$e and ordinary velocity $hall nece$$arily
amplifie the mea$ure of the $ame River, and con$equently $hall
be, in great part, cau$es; or we may $ay, potent con-cau$es of
making the extraordinary inundations which Rivers u$e to make.
And its mo$t certain, that as often as a $trong and continual wind
$hall blow again$t the Current of a River, and $hall reduce the
water of the River to $uch tardity of motion, that in the time
wherein before it run five miles, it now moveth but one, $uch a
River will increa$e to five times the mea$ure, though there $hould
not be added any other quantity of water; which thing indeed
hath in it $omething of $trange, but it is mo$t certain, for that
look what proportion the waters velocity before the winde, hath
to the velocity after the winde, and $uch reciprocally is the mea-
$ure of the $ame water after the winde, to the mea$ure before
the winde; and becau$e it hath been $uppo$ed in our ca$e that the
velocity is dimini$hed to a fifth part, therefore the mea$ure $hall
be increa$ed five times more than that, which it was before.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> VIII.</head>
<P>We have al$o probable the cau$e of the inundations of <I>Tyber,</I>
which befel at <I>Rome,</I> in the time of <I>Alexander</I> the Sixth, &amp; of
<I>Clement</I> the Seventh; which innundations came in a $erene time,
and without great thaws of the Snows; which therefore much
puzzled the wits of tho$e times. But we may with much pro-
bability affirm, That the River ro$e to $uch a height and excre$-
cence, by the retardation of the Waters dependant on the
boi$trous and con$tant Winds, that blew in tho$e times, as is no-
red in the memorials.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE.</I> IX.</head>
<P>It being mo$t manife$t, that by the great abundance of Water
the Torrents may increa$e, and of them$elves alone exorbitantly
$well the River; and having demon$trated that al$o without new
Water, but onely by the notable retardment the River ri$eth and
increa$eth in mea$ure, in proportion as the velocity decrea$eth:
hence it is apparent, that each of the$e cau$es being able of it $elf,
and $eparate from the other to $well the River; when it $hall
happen that both the$e two cau$es con$pire the augmentation of
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>9</p>
the River, in $uch a ca$e there mu$t follow very great and irre-
pable innundations.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> X.</head>
<P>From what hath been demon$trated, we may with facility re-
$olve the doubt which hath troubled, and $till po$eth the mo$t
diligent, but incautelous ob$ervers of Rivers, who mea$uring
the Streams and Torrents which fall into another River; as tho$e
for in$tance, which enter into the <I>Po,</I> or tho$e which fall into <I>Ti-
ber</I>; and having $ummed the total of the$e mea$ures, and con-
ferring the mea$ures of the Rivers and Brooks, which fall into
<I>Tiber,</I> with the mea$ure of <I>Tiber,</I> and the mea$ures of tho$e which
di$imbogue into <I>Po,</I> with the mea$ure of <I>Po,</I> they find them not
equal, as, it $eems to them, they ought to be, and this is becau$e
they have not well noted the mo$t important point of the varia-
tion of velocity, and how that it is the mo$t potent cau$e of won-
derfully altering the mea$ures of running Waters; but we mo$t
facilly re$olving the doubt, may $ay that the$e Waters dimini$h
the mea$ure, being once entered the principal Channel, becau$e
they increa$e in velocity.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> XI.</head>
<P>Through the ignorance of the force of the velocity of the Wa-
ter, in altering its mea$ure, &amp; augmenting it when the velocity
dimini$heth; and dimini$hing it when the velocity augmenteth:
The Architect <I>Giovanni Fontana,</I> endeavoured to mea$ure, and
and to cau$e to be mea$ured by his Nephew, all the Brooks and
Rivers which di$charged their Waters into <I>Tiber,</I> at the time of
the Innundation; which happened at <I>Rome</I> in the year 1598,
and publi$hed a $mall Treati$e thereof, wherein he $ummeth up
the mea$ures of the extraordinary Water which fell into <I>Tiber,</I>
and made account that it was about five hundred Ells more than
ordinary; and in the end of that Treati$e concludeth, that to re-
move the Innundation wholly from <I>Rome,</I> it would be nece$$ary
to make two other Channels, equal to that at pre$ent, and that
le$$e would not $uffice; and finding afterwards that the whole
Stream pa$$ed under the Bridge <I>Quattro-Capi,</I> (the Arch where-
of is of a far le$s mea$ure then five hundred Ells) concludeth,
that under the $aid Bridge pa$t a hundred fifty one Ells of Water
compre$$ed, (I have $et down the preci$e term of compre$t Wa-
ter, written by <I>Fontana</I>) wherein I finde many errors.</P>
<P>The fir$t of which is to think that the mea$ures of the$e Wa-
ters compre$$ed in the Channels of tho$e Brooks and Rivers,
<foot>Ccco $hould</foot>
<p n=>10</p>
$hould maintain them$elves the $ame in <I>Tiber,</I> which by his leave,
is mo$t fal$e, when ever tho$e waters reduced into <I>Tiber,</I> retain
not the $ame velocity which they had in the place in which <I>Fon-
tana</I> and his Nephew mea$ured them: And all this is manife$t
from the things which we have above explained; for, if the Wa-
ters reduced into <I>Tiber</I> increa$e in velocity, they decrea$e in mea-
$ure; and if they decrea$e in velocity, they increa$e in mea-
$ure.</P>
<P>Secondly, I con$ider that the mea$ures of tho$e Brooks and
Rivers, which enter into <I>Tiber</I> at the time of Innundation, are
not between them$elves really the $ame, when their velocities are
not equal, though they have the $ame names of Ells and Feet;
for that its po$$ible that a di$inboguement of ten Ells requadrated
(to $peak in the phra$e of <I>Fontana</I>) of one of tho$e Brooks,
might di$charge into <I>Tiber</I> at the time of Innundation, four, ten,
and twenty times le$s Water, than another mouth equal to the
fir$t in greatne$s, as would occur when the fir$t mouth were four,
ten, or twenty times le$s $wift than the $econd. Whereupon,
whil$t <I>Fontana</I> $ummes up the Ells and Feet of the mea$ures of
tho$e Brooks and Rivers into a total aggregate, he commits the
$ame error with him, which would add into one $umme diver$e
moneys of diver$e values, and diver$e places, but that had the
$ame name; as if one $hould $ay ten Crowns of <I>Roman</I> money,
four Crowns of Gold, thirteen Crowns of <I>Florence,</I> five Growns
of <I>Venice,</I> and eight Crowns of <I>Mantua,</I> $hould make the $ame
$umme with forty Crowns of Gold, or forty Crowns of <I>Mantua.</I></P>
<P>Thirdly, It might happen that $ome River or Current in the
parts nearer <I>Rome,</I> in the time of its flowing, did not $end forth
more Water than ordinary; and however, its a thing very clear,
that whil$t the $tream came from the $uperior parts, that $ame
Brook or River would be augmented in mea$ure, as hath been
noted in the fourth <I>Corollary</I>; in $uch $ort, that <I>Fontana</I> might
have inculcated, and noted that $ame River or Current as con-
curring to the Innundation, although it were therein altogether
unconcerned.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the fourth place we mu$t note, That it might
$o fall out, that $uch a River not onely was unintere$$ed in the
Innundation, though augmented in mea$ure, but it might I $ay
happen, that it was in$trumental to the a$$waging the Innunda-
tion, by augmenting in the mea$ure of its own Channel; which
matter is $ufficiently evident; for if it be $uppo$ed that the Ri-
ver in the time of flood, had not had of it $elf, and from its pro-
per $prings more Water than ordinary, its a thing certain, that
the Water of <I>Tiber</I> ri$ing and increa$ing; al$o that River, to le-
vel it $elf with the Water of <I>Tiber,</I> would have retained $ome of
<foot>its</foot>
<p n=>11</p>
its Waters in its own Chanel, without di$charging them into <I>Ty-
ber,</I> or el$e would have ingorged and $wallowed (if I may $o $ay)
$ome of the water of <I>Tyber</I>; and in this ca$e, at the time of In-
undation, le$$e abundance of water would have come to <I>Rome,</I>
and yet neverthele$$e the mea$ure of that River would have been
increa$ed.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <I>Fontana</I> deceiveth him$elf, when he concludeth, that
to remove the Inundation from <I>Rome,</I> it would be nece$$ary to
make two other Chanels of Rivers, that were as large as that,
which is the pre$ent one, and that le$s would not $uffice, which,
I $ay, is a fallacy: and to convince him ea$ily of his errour, it
$ufficeth to $ay, that all the Streams being pa$$ed under the Bridge
<I>Quattro-Capi,</I> as he him$elf atte$ts, a Channel would $uffice on-
ly of the capacity of the $aid Bridge, provided that the water
there might run with the $ame velocity, as it did under the Bridge
at the time of Inundation; and on the contrary, twenty Cur-
rents of capacity equal to the pre$ent one, would not $uffice, if
the water $hould run with twenty times le$s velocity, than it made
at the time of the Inundation.</P>
<P>Sixthly, to me it $eemeth a great weakne$$e to $ay, that there
$hould pa$$e under the Bridge <I>Quattro-Capi,</I> an hundred fifty one
ells of water compre$$ed; for that I do not under$tand that wa-
ter is like Cotton or Wool, which matters may be pre$t and trod,
as it happeneth al$o to the air, which receiveth compre$$ion in
$uch $ort, that after that in $ome certain place a quantity of air
$hall be reduced to its natural con$titution; and having taken up
all the $aid place, yet neverthele$$e compre$$ing the fir$t Air
with force and violence, it is reduced into far le$s room, and will
admit four or $ix times as much air, as before, as is experimen-
tally ^{*} $een in the Wind-Gun, invented in our dayes by <I>M. Vin,</I>
<marg>* And as is at
large demon$trated
by that mo$t excel-
lent and lonour-
able per$onage Mr.
<I>Botle</I> in the indu-
$trious experiment
of his Pneumatical
Engine.</marg>
<I>cenzo Vincenti</I> of <I>Vrbin,</I> which property of the Air of admit-
ting conden$ation, is al$o $een in the portable Fountains of the
$ame <I>M. Vincenzo:</I> which Fountains $pirt the Water on high,
by force of the Air compre$$ed, which whil$t it $eeks to reduce
its $elf to its natural con$titution, in the dilation cau$eth that vi-
olence. But the water can never, for any thing I know, crowd,
or pre$s $o, as that if before the compre$$ion it held or po$$e$t a
place, being in its natural con$titution, I believe not, I $ay, that it
is po$$ible, by pre$$ing and crowding to make it po$$e$s le$s room,
for if it were po$$ible to compre$s the Water, and make it to oc-
cupy a le$s place, it would thence follow, that two Ve$$els of e-
qual mea$ure, but of unequal height, $hould be of unequal capa-
city, and that $hould hold more water which was higher; al$o a
Cylinder, or other Ve$$el more high than broad, would containe
more water erected, than being laid along; for that being erect-
<foot>Cccc 2 ed,</foot>
<p n=>12</p>
ed, the water put therein would be more pre$$ed and crowded.</P>
<P>And therefore, in our ca$e, according to our principles we will
$ay, that the water of that Stream pa$seth all under the $aid
Bridge <I>Quattro-Capi,</I> for that being there mo$t $wift, it ought of
con$equence to be le$s in mea$ure.</P>
<P>And here one may $ee, into how many errours a man may run
through ignorance of a true and real Principle, which once known
and well under$tood, takes away all mi$ts of doubting, and ea-
$ily re$olveth all difficulties.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE.</I> XII.</head>
<P>Through the $ame inadvertency of not regarding the variation
of velocity in the $ame Current, therea re committed by Ingi-
neers and Learned men, errours of very great moment (and I
could thereof produce examples, but for good rea$ons I pa$s
them over in $ilence) when they think, and propo$e, by deriving
new Channels from great Rivers, to dimini$h the mea$ure of the
water in the River, and to dimini$h it proportionally, according
to the mea$ure of the Water which they make to pa$s through
the Channel, as making <I>v.g</I> a Channel fifty foot broad, in which
the derived water is to run wa$te, ten foot deep, they think they
have dimini$hed the mea$ure of the Water in the River five hun-
dred feet, which thing doth not indeed $o fall out; and the rea-
$on is plain; for that the Chanel being derived, the re$t of the
main River, dimini$heth in velocity, and therefore retains a grea-
ter mea$ure than it had at fir$t before the derivation of the Cha-
nel; and moreover, if the Chanel being derived, it $hall not
con$erve the $ame velocity which it had at fir$t in the main Ri-
ver, but $hall dimini$h it, it will be nece$$ary, that it hath a grea-
ter mea$ure than it had before in the River; and therefore
to accompt aright, there $hall not be $o much water derived into
the Channel, as $hall dimini$h the River, according to the quanti-
ty of the water in the Channel, as is pretended.</P>

$elves to the common opinion, $ince it would be very $trange if
the multitude in $uch matters $hould hit on the truth, nor ought
that to be held difficult, in which even the vulgar do know the
truth and right; be$ides that I hope morever to prove all in $uch
$ort, that per$ons of $olid judgment, $hall re$t fully per$waded,
$o that they but keep in mind the principal ground and foundation
of all this Treati$e; and though that which I will propo$e, be a par-
ticular, as I have $aid, pertaining onely to the intere$ts of <I>Ferara</I>;
yet neverthele$$e from this particular Doctrine well under$tood,
good judgement may be made of other the like ca$es in general.</P>
<P>I $ay then, for greater per$pecuity, and better under$tanding
of the whole, That about thirteen miles above <I>Ferara,</I> near to
<I>Stellata,</I> the main of P<I>o,</I> branching it $elf into two parts, with one
of its Arms it cometh clo$e to <I>Ferara,</I> retaining the name of the
P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I>; and here again it divideth it $elf into two other
branches, and that which continueth on the right hand, is called
the P<I>o</I> of <I>Argenta,</I> and of <I>Primaro</I>; and that on the left the P<I>o</I>
of <I>Volana.</I> But for that the bed of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I> being here-
tofore augmented and rai$ed, it followeth that it re$teth wholly
deprived of the Water of the great P<I>o,</I> except in the time of its
greater $welling; for in that ca$e, this P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I> being re-
$trained with a Bank near to <I>Bondeno,</I> would come al$o in the
overflowings of the main P<I>o,</I> to be free from its Waters: But the
Lords of <I>Ferara</I> are wont at $uch time as the P<I>o</I> threateneth to
break out, to cut the bank; by which cutting, there di$-
gorgeth $uch a Torrent of Water, that it is ob$erved, that the
main P<I>o</I> in the $pace of $ome few hours abateth near a foot, and
all per$ons that I have $poken with hitherto, moved by this ex-
periment, think that it is of great profit and benefit to keep ready
this Vent, and to make u$e of it in the time of its fullne$$e. And
indeed, the thing con$idered $imply, and at the fir$t appearance,
it $eemeth that none can think otherwi$e; the rather, for that
many examining the matter narrowly, mea$ure that body of
Water which runneth by the Channel, or Bed of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Fera-
ra,</I> and make account, that the body of the Water of the great
P<I>o,</I> is dimini$hed the quantity of the body of the Water which
runneth by the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara.</I> But if we well remember what
hath been $aid in the beginning of the Treati$e, and how much
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>14</p>
the variety of the velocities of the $aid Water importeth, and the
knowledge of them is nece$$ary to conclude the true quantity of
the running Water, we $hall finde it manife$t, that the benefit of
this Vent is far le$$e than it is generally thought: And mereover,
we $hall finde, if I deceive not my $elf, that there follow from
thence $o many mi$chiefs, that I could greatly incline to believe,
that it were more to the purpo$e wholly to $top it up, than to
maintain it open: yet I am not $o wedded to my opinion, but
that I am ready to change my judgement upon $trength of better
rea$ons; e$pecially of one that $hall have fir$t well under$tood
the beginning of this my di$cour$e, which I frequently inculcate,
becau$e its ab$olutely impo$$ible without this adverti$ement to
treat of the$e matters, and not commit very great errours.</P>
<P>I propo$e therefore to con$ideration, that although it be true,
that whil$t the water of the main P<I>o</I> is at its greate$t height, the
Bank and Dam then cut of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara,</I> and the $uperior
waters having a very great fall into the Channel of <I>Ferara,</I> they
precipitate into the $ame with great violence and velocity, and
with the $ame in the beginning, or little le$$e, they run towards
the P<I>o</I> of <I>Volana,</I> and of <I>Argenta</I> on the $ea coa$ts; yet after the
$pace of $ome few hours, the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I> being full, and the $u-
perior Waters not finding $o great a diclivity there, as they had
at the beginning of the cutting, they fall not into the $ame with
the former velocity, but with far le$$e, and thereby a great deal
le$$e Water begins to i$$ue from the great P<I>o</I>; and if we dili-
gently compare the velocity at the fir$t cutting, with the velocity
of the Water after the cutting made, and when the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I>
$hall be full of Water, we $hall finde perhaps that to be fifteen or
twenty times greater than this, and con$equently the Water
which i$$ues from the great P<I>o,</I> that fir$t impetuo$ity being pa$t,
$hall be onely the fifteenth or twentieth part of that which i$$ued
at the beginning; and therefore the Waters of the main P<I>o</I> will
return in a $mall time almo$t to the fir$t height. And here I will
pray tho$e who re$t not wholly $atisfied with what hath been $aid,
that for the love of truth, and the common good, they would
plea$e to make diligent ob$ervation whether in the time of great
Floods, the $aid Bank or Dam at <I>Bondeno</I> is cut, and that in few
hours the main P<I>o</I> dimini$heth, as hath been $aid about a foot in
its heigh<*>; that they would ob$erve I $ay, whether, a day or two
being pa$t, the Waters of the main P<I>o</I> return almo$t to their fir$t
height; for if this $hould follow, it would be very clear, that the
benefit which re$ulteth from this diver$ion or Vent, is not $o great
as is univer$ally pre$umed; I $ay, it is not $o great as is
pre$umed; becau$e, though it be granted for true, that
the Waters of the main P<I>o,</I> abate at the beginning of
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>17</p>
the Vent, yet this benefit happens to be but temporary and for a
few hours: If the ri$ing of P<I>o,</I> and the dangers of breaking forth
were of $hort duration, as it ordinarily befalleth in the overflow-
ings of Torrents, in $uch a ca$e the profit of the Vent would be
of $ome e$teem: But becau$e the $wellings of P<I>o</I> continue for
thirty, or $ometimes for forty dayes, therefore the gain which
re$ults from the Vent proveth to be incon$iderable. It remain-
eth now to con$ider the notable harms which follow the $aid
Sluice or Vent, that $o reflection being made, and the profit and
the detriment compared, one may rightly judge, and choo$e that
which $hall be mo$t convenient. The fir$t prejudice therefore
which ari$eth from this Vent or Sluice, is; That the Channels of
<I>Ferara, Primaro,</I> and <I>Volana</I> filling with Water, all tho$e parts
from <I>Bondeno</I> to the Sea $ide are allarmed and endangered
thereby. Secondly, The Waters of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Primaro</I> having
free ingre$$e into the upper Valleys, they fill them to the great
damage of the Fields adjacent, and ob$truct the cour$e of the
ordinary Trenches in the $ame Valleys; in$omuch that all the
care, co$t, and labour about the draining, and freeing the upper
Valleys from Water, would al$o become vain and ineffectual.
Thirdly, I con$ider that the$e Waters of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I> being
pa$$ed downwards towards the Sea, at the time that the main P<I>o</I>
was in its greater excre$cences and heights, it is manife$t by expe-
rience, that when the great P<I>o</I> dimini$heth, then the$e Waters
pa$$ed by the P<I>o</I> of <I>Ferara</I> begin to retard in their cour$e, and
finally come to turn the current upwards towards <I>Stellata,</I> re$ting
fir$t iu the intermediate time, almo$t fixed and $tanding, and
therefore depo$ing the muddine$$e, they fill up the Channel of
the River or Current of <I>Ferara.</I> Fourthly and la$tly, There
followeth from this $ame diver$ion another notable damage, and
it is like to that which followeth the breaches made by Rivers;
near to which breaches in the lower parts, namely below the
breach, there is begot in the Channel of the River, a certain ridge
or $helf, that is, the bottom of the River is rai$ed, as if $ufficiently
manife$t by experience; and thus ju$t in the $ame manner cutting
the Bank at <I>Bondeno,</I> there is at it were a breach made, from which
followeth the ri$ing in the lower parts of the main P<I>o,</I> being pa$t
the mouth of <I>Pamaro</I>; which thing, how pernitious it is, let any one
judge that under$tandeth the$e matters. And therefore both for
the $mall benefit, and $o many harms that en$ue from maintain-
ing this diver$ion, I $hould think it were more $ound advice to
keep that Bank alwaies whole at <I>Bondeno,</I> or in any other conve-
nient place, and not to permit that the Water of the Grand P<I>o</I>
$hould ever come near to <I>Ferara.</I></P>

<P>In the Grand Rivers, which fall into the Sea, as here in <I>Italy
Po, Adige,</I>^{*} and <I>Arno,</I> which are armed with Banks again$t their
excre$cencies, its ob$erved that far from the Sea, they need
Banks of a notable height; which height goeth afterwards by
degrees dimini$hing, the more it approacheth to the Sea-coa$ts:
in $uch $ort, that the P<I>o,</I> di$tant from the Sea about fifty or $ixty
miles at <I>Ferara,</I> $hall have Banks that be above twenty feet
higher than the ordinary Water marks; but ten or twelve miles
from the Sea, the Banks are not twelve feet higher than the $aid
ordinary Water-marks, though the breadth of the River be the
$ame, $o that the excre$cence of the $ame Innundation happens
to be far greater in mea$ure remote from the Sea, then near; and
yet it $hould $eem, that the $ame quantity of Water pa$$ing by
every piace, the River $hould need to have the $ame altitude of
Banks in all places: But we by our Principles and fundamentals
may be able to render the rea$on of that effect, and $ay; That
that exce$$e of quantity of Water, above the ordinary Water,
goeth alwaies acquiring greater velocity; the nearer it approach-
eth the Sea, and therefore decrea$eth in mea$ure, and con$equenly
in height. And this perhaps might have been the cau$e in great
part, why the <I>Tyber</I> in the Innundation <I>Anno</I> 1578. i$$ued not
forth of its Channel below <I>Rome</I> towards the Sea.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> XV.</head>
<P>From the $ame Doctrine may be rendred a mo$t manife$t rea-
$on why the falling Waters go le$$ening in their de$cent, $o
that the $ame falling Water, mea$ured at the beginning of
its fall, is greater, and bigger, and afterwards by degrees le$$eneth
in mea$ure the more it is remote from the beginning of the fall.
Which dependeth on no other, than on the acqui$ition, which
it $ucce$$ively makes of greater velocity; it being a mo$t fami-
liar conclu$ion among Philo$ophers, that grave bodies falling,
the more they remove from the beginning of their motion, the
more they acquire of $wiftne$$e; and therefore the Water, as a
grave body, falling, gradually velocitates, and therefore de-
crea$eth in mea$ure, and le$$eneth.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I> XVI.</head>
<P>And on the contrary, the $pirtings of a Fountain of Water,
which $pring on high, work a contrary effect; namely
<foot>in</foot>
<p n=>17</p>
in the beginning they are $mall, and afterwards become greater
and bigge; and the rea$on is mo$t manife$t, becau$e in the be-
ginning they are very $wift, and afterwards gradually relent
their impetuo$ity, and motion, $o that in the beginning of the
excur$ion that they make, they ought to be $mall, and after-
wards to grow bigger, as in the effect is $een.</P>
<head>APPENDIX. I.</head>
<P>Into the errour of not con$idering how much the different
velocities of the $ame running water in $everal places of
its current, are able to change the mea$ure of the $ame
water, and to make it greater, or le$$e, I think, if I be not
deceived, that <I>Ginlio Frontino</I> a noble antient Writer, may
have faln in the Second Book which he writ, of the Aqueducts
of the City of <I>Rome</I>: Whil$t finding the mea$ure of the Water
^{*}<I>Commentaries</I> le$$e than it was <I>in erogatione 1263. Quinaries,</I> he
<marg>+ <I>Commentarius</I>
beareth many $en-
$es, but in this
place $ignifieth a
certain Regi$ter of
the quantities of
the Waters in the
$everal publique A-
qu ducts of <I>Rome</I>;
which word I find
frequently u$ed in
the Law-books of
antient Civilians:
Andby errogation
we are to under-
$tand the di$tribu-
tion or delivering
out of tho$e $tores
of Water.</marg>
thought that $o much difference might proceed from the negligence
of the Mea$ures; and when afterwards with his own indu$try he
mea$ured the $ame water at the beginnings of the Aqueducts,
finding it neer 10000. <I>Quinaries</I> bigger than it was <I>in Commenta-
riis</I> he judged, that the overplus was imbeziled by Mini$ters and
Partakers; which in part might be $o, for it is but too true, that
the publique is almo$t alwayes defrauded; yet neverthele$$e, I
verily believe withal, that be$ides the frauds of the$e Officers,
the velocities of the water in the place wherein <I>Frontino</I> mea$u-
red, it might be different from tho$e velocities, which are
found in other places before mea$ured by others; and there-
fore the mea$ures of the waters might, yea ought nec$$arily to
be diffcrent, it having been by us demon$trated, that the mea-
$ures of the $ame running water have reciprocal proportion to
their velocities. Which <I>Frontino</I> not well con$idering, and find-
ing the water <I>in Commentariis 12755. Quinaries in erogati-
one</I> 14018, and in his own mea$ure <I>ad capita ductuum,</I> at the
head of the fountain 22755. <I>Quinaries,</I> or thereabouts, he
thought, that in all the$e places there pa$t different quantities of
water; namely, greater at the fountain head then that which was
<I>in Erogatione,</I> and this he judged greater than that which was
<I>in Commentariis.</I></P>
<head>APPENDIX II.</head>
<P>Alike mi$take chanced lately in the Aqueduct of <I>Acqua-
Paola,</I> which Water $hould be 2000 Inches, and $o many
effectively ought to be allowed; and it hath been given in
<foot>Dddd $o</foot>
<p n=>18</p>
$o to be by the Signors of <I>Bracciano</I> to the <I>Apo$tolick-Chamber</I>;
and there was a mea$ure thereof made at the beginning of the
Aqueduct; which mea$ure proved afterwards much le$$e and
$hort, con$idered and taken in <I>Rome,</I> and thence followed di$-
contents and great di$orders, and all becau$e this property of
Running-Waters, of increa$ing in mea$ure, where the velocity
decrea$ed; and of dimini$hing in mea$ure, where the velocity
augmented, was not lookt into.</P>
<head>APPENDIX III.</head>
<P>Alike errour, in my judgement, hath beeen committed by
all tho$e learned men, which to prevent the diver$ion of
the <I>Reno</I> of <I>Bologna</I> into P<I>o</I> by the Channels, through
which it at pre$ent runneth, judged, that the <I>Reno</I> being in its
greater excre$cence about 2000 feet, and the P<I>o</I> being near
1000 feet broad, they judged, I $ay, that letting the <I>Reno</I> into
P<I>o,</I> it would have rai$ed the Water of P<I>o</I> two feet; from which
ri$e, they concluded afterwards mo$t exorbitant di$orders, either
of extraordinary Inundations, or el$e of immen$e and intolera-
ble expences to the people in rai$ing the Banks of P<I>o</I> and <I>Reno,</I>
and with $uch like weakne$$es, often vainly di$turbed the minds
of the per$ons concerned: But now from the things demon$tra-
ted, it is manife$t, That the mea$ure of the <I>Reno</I> in <I>Reno,</I> would
be different from the mea$ure of <I>Reno</I> in P<I>o</I>; in ca$e that the
velocity of the <I>Reno</I> in P<I>o,</I> $hould differ from the velocity
of <I>Reno</I> in <I>Reno,</I> as is more exactly determined in the fourth Pro-
po$ition.</P>
<head>APPENDIX IV.</head>
<P>No le$s likewi$e are tho$e Ingeneers and Arti$ts deceived,
that have affirmed, That letting the <I>Reno</I> into P<I>o,</I> there
would be no ri$e at all in the Water of P<I>o</I>: For the truth
is, That letting <I>Reno</I> into P<I>o,</I> there would alwaies be a ri$ing; but
$ometimes greater, $ometimes le$$e, as the P<I>o</I> $hall have a $wifter
or $lower Current; $o that if the P<I>o</I> $hall be con$tituted in a great
velocity, the ri$e will be very $mall; and if the $aid P<I>o</I> $hall be
$low in its cour$e, then the ri$e will be notable.</P>
<head>APPENDIX V.</head>
<P>And here it will not be be$ides the purpo$e to adverti$e, That
the mea$ures, partments, and di$tributions of the Waters
of Fountains, cannot be made exactly, unle$s there be con-
<foot>$idered</foot>
<p n=>19</p>
fidered, be$ides the mea$ure, the velocity al$o of the Water;
which particular not being thorowly ob$erved, is the cau$e of
continual mi$cariages in $uch like affairs.</P>
<head>APPENDIX VI.</head>
<P>Like con$ideration ought to be had with the greater diligence,
for that an errour therein is more prejudicial; I $ay, ought to
be had by tho$e which part and divide Waters; for the
watering of fields, as is done in the Territories of <I>Bre$cia, Ber-
gama, Crema, Pavia, Lodigiano, Cremona,</I> and other places:
For if they have not regard to the mo$t important point of the
variation of the velocity of the Water, but onely to the bare
Vulgar mea$ure, there will alwaies very great di$orders and pre-
judices en$ue to the per$ons concerned.</P>
<head>APPENDIX VII.</head>
<P>It $eemeth that one may ob$erve, that whil$t the Water run-
neth along a Channel, Current, or Conduit, its velocity is
retarded, withheld, and impeded by its touching the Bank or
$ide of the $aid Channel or Current; which, as immoveable, not
following the motion of the Water, interrupteth its velocity:
From which particular, being true, as I believe it to be mo$t
true, and from our con$iderations, we have an occa$ion of di$-
covering a very nice mi$take, into which tho$e commonly fall
who divide the Waters of Fountains. Which divi$ion is wont
to be, by what I have $een here in <I>Rome,</I> performed two wayes;
The fir$t of which is with the mea$ures of like figures, as Cir-
cles, or Squares, having cut through a Plate of metal $everal
Circles or Squares, one of half an inch, another of one inch,
another of two, of three, of four, <I>&amp;c.</I> with which they after-
wards adju$t the Cocks to di$pence the Waters. The other
manner of dividing the Waters of Fountains, is with rectangle
paralellograms, of the $ame height, but of different Ba$es, in $uch
$ort likewi$e, that one paralellogram be of half an inch, another
of one, two, three, <I>&amp;c.</I> In which manner of mea$uring and
dividing the Water, it $hould $eem that the Cocks being placed
in one and the $ame plain, equidi$tant from the level, or $uperior
$uperficies of the water of the Well; and the $aid mea$ures be-
ing mo$t exactly made, the Water ought con$equently al$o to
be equally divided, and parted according to the proportion of
the mea$ures. But if we well con$ider every particular, we $hall
finde, that the Cocks, as they $ucce$$ively are greater, di$charge
alwaies more Water than the ju$t quantity, in compari$on of
<foot>Dddd 2 the</foot>
<p n=>20</p>
the le$$er; that is, to $peak more properly, The Water which
pa$$eth through the greater Cock, hath alwaies a greater pro-
portion to that which pa$$eth through the le$$er, than the greater
Cock hath to the le$$er. All which I will declare by an exam-
ple.</P>
<P>Let there be $uppo$ed for more plainne$s two Squares; (the
$ame may be under$tood of Circles, and other like Figures) The
fir$t Square is, as we will $uppo$e, quadruple to the other, and
the$e Squares are the mouths of two Cocks.; one of four inches,
the other of one: Now its manife$t by what hath been $aid, that
the Water which pa$$eth by the le$s Cock, findeth its velocity
impeded in the circumference of the Cock; which impediment
<fig>
is mea$ured by the $aid circumfe-
rence. Now it is to be con$ider-
ed, that if we would have the Wa-
ter which pa$$eth through the
greater Cock, to be onely qua-
druple to that which pa$$eth
through the le$$e, in equal $paces of time, it would be nece$$ary,
that not onely the capacity and the mea$ure of the greater Cock
be quadruple to the le$$er Cock, but that al$o the impediment be
quadrupled. Now in our ca$e it is true, That the belly and
mouth of the Cock is quadrupled, and yet the impediment is not
quadrupled, but is onely doubled; $eeing that the circumference
of the greater Square, is onely double to the circumference of
the le$ier Square; for the greater circumference containeth eight
of tho$e parts, of which the le$$er containeth but four, as is ma-
nife$t by the de$cribed Figure; and for that cau$e there $hall
pa$s by the greater Cock, above four times as much Water, as
$hall pa$s by the le$$er Cock.</P>
<P>The like errour occurreth al$o in the other manner of mea$u-
ring the Water of a Fountain, as may ea$ily be collected from
what hath been $aid and ob$erved above.</P>
<head>APPENDIX VIII.</head>
<P>The $ame contemplation di$covereth the errour of tho$e
Architects, who being to erect a Bridge of $undry Arches
over a River, con$ider the ordinary breadth of the River;
which being <I>v. g.</I> fourty fathom, and the Bridge being to con$i$t
of four Arches, it $ufficeth them, that the breadth of all the four
Arches taken together, be fourty fathom; not con$idering that
in the ordinary Channel of the River, the Water hath onely
two impediments which retard its velocity; namely, the touching
and gliding along the two $ides or $hores of the River: but
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>21</p>
the $ame water in pa$$ing under the Bridge, in our ca$e meeteth
with eight of the $ame impediments, bearing, and thru$ting upon
two $ides of each Arch (to omit the impediment of the bottom,
for that it is the $ame in the River, and under the Bridge) from
which inadvertency $ometimes follow very great di$orders, as
quotidian practice $hews us.</P>
<head>APPENDIX IX.</head>
<P>It is al$o worthy to con$ider the great and admirable benefit
that tho$e fields receive, which are wont to drink up the Rain-
water with difficulty, through the height of the water in the
principal Ditches; in which ca$e the careful Husbandman cutteth
away the reeds and ru$hes in the Ditches, through which the
waters pa$s; whereupon may be pre$ently $een, $o $oon as the
reeds and ru$hes are cut, a notable Ebb in the level of the water
in the Ditches; in$omuch that $ometimes it is ob$erved, that the
water is abated after the $aid cutting a third and more, of what it
was before the cutting. The which effect $eemingly might de-
pend on this, That, before tho$e weeds took up room in the
Ditch, and for that cau$e the water kept a higher level, and the
$aid Plants being afterwards cut and removed, the water came to
abate, po$$e$$ing the place that before was occupied by the
weeds: Which opinion, though probable, and at fir$t $ight $a-
tisfactory, is neverthele$s in$ufficient to give the total rea$on of
that notable abatement which hath been $poken of: But it is ne-
ce$$ary to have recour$e to our confideration of the velocity in
the cour$e of the water, the chiefe$t and true cau$e of the vari-
ation of the mea$ure of the $ame Running-Water; for, that
multitudes of reeds, weeds, and plants di$per$ed through the cur-
rent of the Ditch, do chance notably to retard the cour$e of the
water, and therefore the mea$ure of the water increa$eth; and
tho$e impediments removed, the $ame water gaineth velocity,
and therefore decrea$eth in mea$ure, and con$equently in
height.</P>
<P>And perhaps this point well under$tood, may be of great
profit to the fields adjacent to the <I>Pontine</I> Fens, and I doubt not
but if the River <I>Ninfa,</I> and the other principal Brooks of tho$e
Territories were kept well clean$ed from weeds, their waters
would be at a lower level, and con$equently the drains of the
fields would run into them more readily; it being alwayes to be
held for undoubted, that the mea$ure of the water before the
clean$ing, hath the $ame proportion to the mea$ure after clean-
$ing, that the velocity after the clean$ing hath to the velocity
before the clean$ing: An dbecau$e tho$e weeds being clean$ed
<foot>away,</foot>
<p n=>22</p>
away, the cour$e ef the water notably increa$eth, it is therefore
nece$$ary that the $aid water abate in mea$ure, and become
lower.</P>
<head>APPENDIX. X.</head>
<P>We having above ob$erved $ome errors that are commit-
ted in di$tributing the waters of Fountains, and tho$e
that $erve to water fields; it $eemeth now fit, by way of
a clo$e to this di$cour$e, to adverti$e by what means the$e divi-
$ions may be made ju$tly and without error. I therefore think
that one might two $everal wayes exqui$itly divide the water of
Fountains; The fir$t would be by diligently examining, Fir$t,
how much water the whole Fountain di$chargeth in a determi-
nate time, as for in$tance: How many Barrels, or Tuns it carri-
eth in a $et time; and in ca$e you are afterwards to di$tribute
the water, di$tribute it at the rate of $omany Barrels or Tuns, in
that $ame time; and in this ca$e the participants would have
their punctual $hares: Nor could it ever happen to $end out more
water, than is reckoned to be in the principal Fountain; as befel
<I>Giulio Frontino,</I> and as al$o it frequently happeneth in the Mo-
dern Aqueducts, to the publick and private detriment.</P>
<P>The other way of dividing the $ame waters of a Fountain, is
al$o $ufficiently exact and ea$ie, and may be, by having one one-
ly $ize for the Cock or Pipe, as $uppo$e of an inch, or of half an
inch; and when the ca$e requireth to di$pence two, three, and
more inches, take $o many Cocks of the $aid mea$ure as do eva-
cuate the water, which is to be emitted; and if we are to make
u$e onely of one greater Cock, we being to place one to di$-
charge for example four inches; and having the former $ole mea-
$ure of an inch, we mu$t make a Cock that is bigger, its true, than
the Cock of one inch; but not $imply in a quadruple propor-
tion, for that it would di$charge more than ju$t $o much water,
as hath been $aid above; but we ought to examine diligently
how much water the little Cock emitteth in an hour; and then
enlarge, and contract the greater Cock, $o, that it may di$-
charge four times as much water as the le$$er in the $ame time;
and by this means we $hall avoid the di$order hinted in the
$eventh Appendix. It would be nece$$ary neverthele$s, to ac-
commodate the Cocks of the Ci$tern $o, that the level of the
water in the Ci$tern may alwayes re$t at one determinate mark
above the Cock, otherwi$e the Cocks will emit $ometimes
greater, and $ometimes le$$e abundance of water: And becau$e
it may be that the $ame water of the Fountain may be $ometimes
more abundant, $ometimes le$s; in $uch ca$e it will be nece$$ary
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>23</p>
to adju$t the Ci$tern $o, that the exce$s above the ordinary wa-
ter, di$charge into the publick Fountains, that $o the particular
participants may have alwayes the $ame abundance of
water.</P>
<head>APPENDIX XI.</head>
<P>Much more difficult is the divi$ion of the waters which
$erve to water the fields, it not being po$$ible to ob$erve
$o commodiou$ly, what quantity of water the whole
Ditch $ends forth in one determinate time, as may be done in
Fountains: Yet neverthele$s, if the $econd propo$ition by us a
little below demon$trated, be well under$tood, there may be
thence taken a very $afe and ju$t way to di$tribute $uch waters.
The Propo$ition therefore by us demon$trated is this: If there
be two Sections, (namely two mouths of Rivers) the quantity of
the water which pa$$eth by the fir$t, hath a proportion to that
which pa$$eth by the $econd, compounded of the proportions of
the fir$t Section to the $econd, and of the velocity through
the fir$t, to the velocity through the $econd: As I will declare
for example by help of practice, that I may be under$tood by
all, in a matter $o important. Let the two mouths of the
Rivers be A, and B, and let
<fig>
the mouth A be in mea$ure
and content thirty two feet,
and the mouth B, eight feet.
Here you mu$t take notice,
that it is not alwayes true, that
the Water which pa$$eth by A,
hath the $ame proportion to that which pa$$eth by B, that the
mouth A hath to the mouth B; but onely when the velocityes
by each of tho$e pa$$ages are equal: But if the velocityes $hall
be unequal, it may be that the $aid mouths may emit equal
quantity of Water in equal times, though their mea$ure be un-
equal; and it may be al$o, that the bigger doth di$charge a great-
er quantity of Water: And la$tly, it may be, that the le$s mouth
di$chargeth more Water than the greater; and all this is mani-
fe$t by the things noted in the beginning of this di$cour$e, and
by the $aid $econd Propo$ition. Now to examine the propor-
tion of the Water that pa$$eth by one Ditch, to that which pa$-
$eth by another, that this being known, the $ame Waters and
mouths of Ditches may be then adju$ted; we are to keep ac-
count not onely of the greatne$s of the mouths or pa$$ages of the
Water, but of the velocity al$o; which we will do, by fir$t find-
ing two numbers that have the $ame proportion between them-
<foot>$elves,</foot>
<p n=>24</p>
$elves, as have the mouths, which are the numbers 32 and 8
in our example: Then this
<fig>
being done, let the velocity
of the Water by the pa$$a-
ges A and B, be examined
(which may be done keeping
account what $pace a piece
of Wood, or other body that
$wimmeth, is carried by the $tream in one determinate time; as
for in$tance in 50 pul$es) and then work by the golden Rule, as
the velocity by A, is to the velocity by B, $o is the number 8, to
another number, which is 4. It is clear by what is demon$tra-
ted in the $aid $econd Propo$ition, that the quantity of water,
which pa$$eth by the mouth A, $hall have the $ame proportion of
that which pa$$eth by the mouth B, that 8 hath to 1. Such pro-
portion being compo$ed of the proportions of 32 to 8, and of 8 to
4; namely, tothe greatne$s of the mouth A, to the greatne$s of the
mouth B, and of the velocity in A, to the velocity in B. This being
done, we mu$t then contract the mouth which di$chargeth more
then its ju$t quantity of water, or enlarge the other which di$char-
geth le$s, as $hal be mo$t commodious in practice, which to him that
hath under$tood this little that hath been delivered, will be very
afie.</P>
<head>APPENDIX XII.</head>
<P>The$e opperations about Water, as I have hitherto on $un-
dry occa$ions ob$erved, are involved in $o many difficul-
ties, and $uch a multiplicity of mo$t extravagant accidents,
that it is no marvel if continually many, and very important er-
rours be therein committed by many, and even by Ingeneers
them$elves, and Learned-men; and becau$e many times they
concern not onely the publique, but private intere$ts: Hence it
is, that it not onely belongeth to Arti$ts to treat thereof, but very
oft even the vulgar them$elves pretend to give their judgement
therein: And I have been troubled many times with a nece$$ity
of treating, not onely with tho$e, which either by practice, or
particular $tudy, under$tood $omewhat in the$e matters; but al$o
with people wholly void of tho$e notions, which are nece$$ary for
one that would on good grounds di$cour$e about this particular;
and thus many times have met with more difficulty in the thick
skulls of men, than in precipitous Torrents, and va$t Fennes.
And in particular, I had occafion $ome years pa$t to go $ee the
Gave or Emi$$ary of the Lake of <I>Perugia,</I> made many years agon
by <I>Braccio Fortobraccio,</I> but for that it was with great ruines by
Time decayed, and rendred unu$eful, it was repaired with in-
<foot>du$try</foot>
<p n=>25</p>
du$try truly heroicall and admirable, by Mon$ignor <I>Maffei Bar-
herino,</I> then Prefect for the Wayes, and now Pope. And being
nece$$itated, that I might be able to walk in the Cave, and for
other cau$es, I let down the Sluices of the $aid Cave, at the mouth
of the Lake: No $ooner were they $topt, but a great many of the
people of the Towns and Villages coa$ting upon the <I>L</I>ake
flocking thither, began to make grievous complaints, that if tho$e
Sluices were kept $hut, not onely the Lake would want its due
Vent, but al$o the parts adjacent to the Lake would be over
flown to their very great detriment. And becau$e at fir$t appea-
rance their motion $eemed very rea$onable, I found my $elf hard
put to it, $eeing no way to per$wade $uch a multitude, that the
prejudice which they pretended I $hould do them by keeping
the Sluices $hut for two dayes, was ab$olutely in$en$ible; and that
by keeping them open, the Lake did not ebb in the $ame time $o
much as the thickne$s of a $heet of Paper: And therefore I was
nece$$itated to make u$e of the authority I had, and $o followed
my bu$ine$s as cau$e required, without any regard to that Rab-
ble tumultuou$ly a$$embled. Now when I am not working with
Mattock or Spade, but with the Pen and Di$cour$e, I intend to
demon$trate clearly to tho$e that are capable of rea$on, and that
have well under$tood the ground of this my Treati$e, that the
fear was altogether vain which tho$e people conceited. And
therefore I $ay, that the Emi$$ary or Sluice of the Lake of <I>Peru-
gia,</I> $tanding in the $ame mannner as at pre$ent, and the water
pa$$ing thorow it with the $ame velocity as now; to examine
how much the Lake may abate in two days $pace, we ought to
con$ider, what proportion the $uperficies of the whole Lake hath
to the mea$ure of the Section of the Emi$$ary, and afterwards to
infer, that the velocity of the water by the Emi$$ary or Sluice,
$hall have the $ame proportion to the abatement of the Lake,
and to prove thorowly and clearly this di$cour$e, I intend to
demon$trate the following Propo$ition.</P>
<P>Suppo$e a Ve$$el of any bigne$$e, and that it hath an Emi$$ary
or Cock, by which it di$chargeth its water. And look what pro-
portion the $uper$icies of the
ve$$el hath to the mea$ure of
<fig>
the $ection of the cock, $uch pro-
portion $hall the velocity of the
Water in the Cock have to the
abatement of the Lake Let the
Ve$$el be A B C D, H I L B, through which the Water runneth,
the $uperficies of the Water in the Ve$$el A D, and the $ection
of the Cock H L: and let the Water in the Ve$$el
be $uppo$ed to have falne in one determinate time from A to F.
<foot>Eeee I</foot>
<p n=>26</p>
I $ay that the proportion of the $uperficies of the Ve$$el A D is
in proportion to the mea$ure of the $ection of the Emi$$ary
H L, as the velocity of the Emi$$ary or Cock to the line A F;
which is manife$t, for that the Water in the Ve$sel moving by
the line A F; as far as F, and the whole ma$s of Water A G
di$charging it $elf, and in the $ame time the $ame quantity of
Water being di$charged by the $ection of the Emi$$ary H L; it
is nece$$ary by what I have demon$trated in the third Propo$ition,
and al$o explained in the beginning of this Treati$e, that the ve-
locity by the Emi$$ary or Cock be in proportion to the velocity
of the abatement, as the $uperficies of the Ve$$el to the mea-
$ure of the $ection of the Emi$$ary, which was to be demon-
$trated.</P>
<P>That which hath been demon$trated in the Ve$$el, falls out ex-
actly al$o in our Lake of <I>Perugia,</I> and its Emi$sary; and becau$e
the immen$ity of the $uperficies of the Lake is in proportion to
the $uperficies of the Emi$sary or Sluice, as many millions to
one, as may be ea$ily calculated; it is manife$t, that $uch abate-
ment $hall be imperceptible, and almo$t nothing, in two dayes
$pace, nay in four or $ix: and all this will be true, when we
$uppo$e that for that time there entreth no other Water into the
Lake from Ditches or Rivolets, which falling into the Lake would
render $uch abatement yet le$s.</P>
<P>Now we $ee, that it's nece$sary to examine $uch abatements
and ri$ings, with excellent rea$ons, or at lea$t, with accurate ex-
periments, before we re$olve and conclude any thing; and how
farre the vulgar are di$tant from a right judgment in $uch
matters.</P>
<head>APPENDIX XIII.</head>
<P>For greater confirmation of all this which I have $aid, I
will in$tance in another like ca$e, which al$o I met with here-
tofore, wherein, for that the bu$ine$s was not rightly un-
der$tood, many di$orders, va$t expences, and con$iderable mi$-
chiefs have followed. There was heretofore an Emi$sary or
Sluice made to drain the Waters, which from Rains, Springs, and
Rivolets fall into a Lake; to the end, the $hores adjoyning on
the Lake, $hould be free from the overflowing of the Waters;
but becau$e perhaps the enterprize was not well managed and
carried on, it fell out, that the Fields adjacent to the $aid Chanel
could not drain, but continued under water; to which di$orders
a pre$ent remedy hath been u$ed, namely, in a time convenient
to $top up the Sluice, by meanes of certain Floodgates kept on
purpo$e for that end; and thus abating the Level of the Water
<foot>in</foot>
<p n=>27</p>
in the Emi$$ary, in the $pace of three or four dayes, the Fields
have been haply drained. But on the other part, the proprietors
bordering on the Lake oppo$ed this, grievou$ly complaining, that
whil$t the Floodgates are $hut, and the cour$e of the Water of
the Sluice hindered, the Lake overflowes the Lands adjacent, by
meanes of the Rivers that fell into it, to their very great damage;
and $o continuing their $uits, they got more of vexation than $a-
tisfaction. Now, being asked my opinion herein, I judged it
requi$ite ($ince the point in controver$ie was about the ri$ing
and falling of the Lake) that the $aid abatement, when the
Floodgates are open, and increa$e when they are $hut $hould be
exactly mea$ured, and told them, that it might be ea$ily done at
a time when no extraordinary Waters fell into the Lake, neither
of Rain, or otherwi$e; and the Lake was undi$turbed by winds
that might drive the Water to any $ide, by planting neer to an
I$let, which is about the middle of the Lake, a thick po$t, on
which $hould be made the marks of the Lakes ri$ing and falling
for two or three dayes. I would not, at that time, pawn, or re-
$olutely declare, my judgment, in regard I might be, by divers
accidents mi$led. But this I told them, that (by what I have
demon$trated, and particularly that which I have $aid above
touching the Lake of <I>Perugia</I>) I inclined greatly to think,
that the$e ri$ings and fallings would prove imperceptible, and
incon$iderable; and therefore, that in ca$e experience $hould
make good my rea$on, it would be to no purpo$e for them to
continue di$puting and wrangling, which cau$eth, (according
to the Proverb) <I>A great deal of cry,</I> but produceth not much
<I>Wool.</I></P>
<P>La$tly, it importing very much to know what a Rain conti-
nued for many dayes can do in rai$ing the$e Lakes, I will here in-
$ert the Copy of a Letter, which I writ formerly to <I>Signior Ga-
lil&aelig;o Galil&aelig;i,</I> chief Philo$opher to the Grand Duke of <I>Tu$cany,</I>
wherein I have delivered one of my conceits in this bu$ine$$e, and
it may be, by this Letter, I may, more $trongly, confirm what I
have $aid above.</P>

<P><I>The Copy of a Letter to</I> Signore GALIL&AElig;O
GALIL&AElig;I, <I>Chief Philo$opher to the mo$t Serene
Great Duke of TVSCANY.</I></P>
<P><I>Worthy and mo$t Excellent</I> SIR,</P>
<P>In $atisfaction of my promi$e, in my former Letters of
repre$enting unto you $ome of my Con$iderations
made upon the Lake <I>Thra$imeno,</I> I $ay, That in times
pa$t, being in <I>Perugia,</I> where we held our General
Convention, having under$tood that the Lake <I>Thra$imeno,</I> by
the great drought of many Moneths was much abated, It came
into my head, to go privately and $ee this novelty, both for my
particular $atisfaction, as al$o that might I be able to relate the
whole to my Patrons, upon the certitude of my own $ight of the
place. And $o being come to the Emi$$ary of the Lake, I found
that the Level of the Lakes $urface was ebbed about five Ro-
man Palmes of its wonted watermark, in$omuch that it was lower
than the tran$ome of the mouth of the Emi$$ary, by the length
of ---------------------------- this de$cribed line, and there-
fore no Water i$$ued out of the Lake, to the great prejudice of
all the places and villages circumjacent, in regard that the Wa-
ter which u$ed to run from the $aid Lake turned 22 Mills, which
not going, nece$$itated the inhabitants of tho$e parts to go a
dayes journey and more, to grinde upon the <I>Tiber.</I> Being retur-
ned to <I>Perugia,</I> there followed a Rain, not very great, but con-
$tant, and even, which la$ted for the $pace of eight hours, or
thereabouts; and it came into my thoughts to examine, being
in <I>Perugia,</I> how much the Lake was increa$ed and railed by this
Rain, $uppo$ing (as it was probable enough) that the Rain had
been univer$al over all the Lake; and like to that which fell in
<I>Perugia,</I> and to this purpo$e I took a Gla$$e formed like a Cy-
linder, about a palme high, and half a palme broad; and having
put in water $nfficient to cover the bottome of the Gla$$e, I no-
ted diligently the mark of the height of the Water in the Gla$$e,
and afterwards expo$ed it to the open weather, to receive the
Raine-water, which fell into it; and I let it $tand for the
$pace of an hour; and having ob$erved that in that time the Wa-
ter was ri$en in the Ve$$el the height of the following line---,
I con$idered that if I had expo$ed to the $ame rain $uch other ve$-
$els equal to that, the Water would have ri$en in them all accor-
ding to that mea$ure: And thereupon concluded, that al$o in all
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>29</p>
the whole extent of the Lake, it was nece$$ary the Water $hould
be rai$ed in the $pace of an hour the $ame mea$ure. Yet here I
con$idered two difficulties that might di$tutb and altar $uch an
effect, or at lea$t render it inob$erveable, which afterwards well
weighed, and re$olved, left me (as I will tell you anon) in the
conclu$ion the more confirmed; that the Lake ought to be in-
crea$ed in the $pace of eight hours, that the rain la$ted eight
times that mea$ure. And whil$t I again expo$ed the Gla$s to re-
peat the experiment, there came unto me an Ingeneer to talk
with me touching certain affairs of our Mona$tary of <I>Perugia,</I> and
di$cour$ing with him, I $hewed him the Gla$s out a<*> my Cham-
ber-window, expo$ed in a Court-yard; and communicated to
him my fancy, relacing unto him all that I had done. But I
$oon perceived that this brave fellow conceited me to be but of
a dull brain, for he $milling $aid unto me; Sir, you deceive
your $elf: I am of opinion that the Lake will not be increa$-
ed by this rain, $o much as the thickne$$e of a ^{*} <I>Julio.</I>
<marg>* A Coyn of Pope
<I>Julius</I> worth $ix
pence.</marg>
Hearing him pronounce this his opinion with freene$s and
confidence, I urged him to give me $ome rea$on for what he
$aid, a$$uring him, that I would change my judgement, when I
$aw the $trength of his Arguments: To which he an$wered, that
he had been very conver$ant about the Lake, and was every day
upon it, and was well a$$ured that it was not at all increa$ed. And
importuning him further, that he would give me $ome rea$on
for his $o thinking, he propo$ed to my con$ideration the great
drought pa$$ed, and that that $ame rain was nothing for the
great parching: To which I an$wered, I believe Sir that the $ur-
face of the Lake, on which the rain had fallen was moi$tned; and
therefore $aw not how its drought, which was nothing at all,
could have drunk up any part of the rain. For all this he per-
$i$ting in his conceit, without yielding in the lea$t to my allega-
tion; he granted in the end (I believe in civility to me) that
my rea$on was plau$ible and good, but that in practi$e it could
not hold. At la$t to clear up all, I made one be called, and
$ent him to the mouth of the Emi$$ary of the Lake, with order
to bring me an exact account, how he found the water of the
Lake, in re$pect of the Tran$ome of the Sluice. Now here,
Signore <I>Galilo,</I> I would not have you think that I had brought
the matter in hand to concern me in my honour; but believe me
(and there are witne$$es of the $ame $till living) that my me$$en-
ger returning in the evening to <I>Perugia,</I> he brought me word,
that the water of the Lake began to run through the Cave; and
that it was ri$en almo$t a fingers breadth above the Tran$ome:
In$omuch, that adding this mea$ure, to that of the lowne$s of
the $urface of the Lake, beneath the Tran$ome before the rain,
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>30</p>
it was manife$t that the ri$ing of the Lake cau$ed by the rain, was
to a hair tho$e four fingers breadth that I had judged it to be.
Two dayes after I had another bout with the Ingeneer, and re-
lated to him the whole bu$ine$s, to which he knew not what to
an$wer.</P>
<P>Now the two difficulties which I thought of, able to impede
my conclu$ion, were the$e following: Fir$t, I con$idered that
it might be, that the Wind blowing from the $ide where the
Sluice $tood, to the Lake-ward; the mole and ma$s of the Wa-
ter of the Lake might be driven to the contrary $hore; on which
the Water ri$ing, it might be fallen at the mouth of the Emi$$a-
ry, and $o the ob$ervation might be much ob$cured. But this
difficulty wholly vani$hed by rea$on of the Aires great tranqui-
lity; which it kept at that time, for no Wind was $tirring on any
$ide, neither whil$t it rained, nor afterwards.</P>
<P>The $econd difficulty which put the ri$ing in doubt, was, That
having ob$erved in <I>Florence,</I> and el$ewhere, tho$e Ponds into
which the rain-water, falling from the hou$e, is conveyed
through the Common-$hores: And that they are not thereby
ever filled, but that they $wallow all that abundance of water,
that runs into them by tho$e conveyances which $erve them with
water; in$omuch that tho$e conveyances which in time of
drought maintain the Pond, when there comes new abundance
of water into the Pond, they drink it up, and $wallow it: A like
effect might al$o fall out in the Lake, in which there being many
veins (as it is very likely) that maintain and feed the Lake; the$e
veins might imbibe the new addition of the Rain-water, and $o
by that means annuall the ri$ing; or el$e dimini$h it in $uch $ort, as
to render it inob$ervable. But this difficulty was ea$ily re$olved
by con$idering my Treati$e of the mea$ure of Running-Waters;
fora$much as having demon$trated, that the abatement of a Lake
beareth the reciprocal proportion to the velocity of the Emi$$a-
ry, which the mea$ure of the Section of the Emi$$ary of the Lake,
hath to the mea$ure of the $urface of the Lake: making the
calculation and account, though in gro$s; by $uppo$ing that its
veins were $ufficiently large, and that the velocity in them were
notable in drinking up the water of the Lake; yet I found never-
thele$s, that many weeks and moneths would be $pent in drink-
ing up the new-come abundance of water by the rain, $o that
I re$ted $ure, that the ri$ing would en$ue, as in effect it did.</P>
<P>And becau$e many of accurate judgement, have again cau$ed
me to que$tion this ri$ing, $etting before me, that the Earth be-
ing parched by the great drought, that had $o long continued, it
might be, that that Bank of Earth which environed the brink of
the Lake, being dry, and imbibing great abundance of Water
<foot>from</foot>
<p n=>31</p>
from the increa$ing Lake, would not $uffer it to increa$e in
height: I $ay therefore, that if we would rightly con$ider this
doubt here propo$ed, we $hould, in the very con$ideration of it,
$ee it re$olved; for, it being $uppo$ed that that li$t or border of
Banks which was to be occupied by the increa$e of the Lake, be
a Brace in breadth quite round the Lake, and that by rea$on of
its dryne$s it $ucks in water, and that by that means this propor-
tion of water co-operates not in rai$ing of the Lake: It is ab$o-
lutely nece$$ary on the other hand, that we con$ider, That the
Circuit of the water of the Lake being thirty miles, as its com-
monly held, that is to $ay, Ninety thou$and Braces of <I>Florence</I>
in compa$s; and therefore admitting for true, that each Brace of
this Bank drink two quarts of water, and that for the $pieading
it require three quarts more, we $hall finde, that the whole agre-
gate of this portion of water, which is not imployed in the rai$ing
of the Lake, will be four hundred and fifty thou$and Quarts of
water; and $uppo$ing that the Lake be $ixty $quare miles, three
thou$and Braces long, we $hall finde, that to di$pence the water
po$$e$t by the Bank about the Lake, above the total $urface of
the Lake, it ought to be $pread $o thin, that one $ole quart of
water may over-$pread ten thou$and $quare Braces of $urface:
$uch a thinne$s, as mu$t much exceed that of a leaf of beaten
Gold, and al$o le$s than that skin of water which covers the Bub-
bles of it: and $uch would that be, which tho$e men would have
$ub$tracted from the ri$ing of the Lake: But again, in the $pace
of a quarter of an hour at the beginning of the rain, all that
Bank is $oaked by the $aid rain, $o that we need not for the
moi$tning of it, imploy a drop of that water which falleth into
the Lake. Be$ides we have not brought to account that abun-
dance of water which runs in time of rain into the Lake, from
the $teepne$s of the adjacent Hills and Mountains; which would
be enough to $upply all our occa$ions: So that, neither ought
we for this rea$on to que$tion our pretended ri$ing. And this
is what hath fallen in my way touching the con$ideration of the
<I>Thra$imenian</I> Lake.</P>
<P>After which, perhaps $omewhat ra$hly, wandring beyond my
bounds, I proceeded to another contemplation, which I will re-
late to you, hoping that you will receive it, as collected with
the$e cautions requi$ite in $uch like affairs; wherein we ought
not too po$itively to affirm any thing of our own heads for cer-
tain, but ought to $ubmit all to the $ound and $ecure delibera-
tion of the Holy Mother-Church, as I do this of mine, and all
others; mo$t ready to change my judgement, and conform my
$elf alwaies to the deliberations of my Superiors. Continu-
<foot>ing</foot>
<p n=>32</p>
ing therefore my above-$aid conceit about the ri$ing of the wa-
ter in the gla$s tried before, it came into my minde, that the
forementioned rain having been very gentle, it might well be,
that if there $hould have faln a Rain fifty, an hundred, or a thou-
$and times greater than this, and much more inten$e (which
would in$ue as oft as tho$e falling drops were four, $ive or ten
times bigger than tho$e of the above-mentioned rain, keeping
the $ame number) in $uch a ca$e its manife$t, that in the $pace
of an hour the Water would ri$e in our Gla$s, two, three, and
perhaps more Yards or Braces; and con$equently, if $uch a
Raine $hould fall upon a Lake, that the $aid Lake would
ri$e, according to the $ame rate: And likewi$e, if $uch a
Rain were univer$all, over the whole Terre$triall Globe, it
would nece$$arily, in the $pace of an hour, make a ri-
$ing of two, or three braces round about the $aid Globe,
And becau$e we have from Sacred Records, that in the
time of the Deluge, it rained fourty dayes and fourty nights;
namely, for the $pace of 960 houres; its clear, that if the $aid
Rain had been ten times bigger than ours at <I>Perugia,</I> the ri$ing
of the Waters above the Terre$trial Globe would reach and pa$s
a mile higher than the tops of the Hills and Mountains that are
upon the $uperficies of the Earth; and they al$o would concur
to increa$e the ri$e. And therefore I conclude, that the ri$e of
the Waters of the Deluge have a rational congruity with natural
Di$cour$es, of which I know very well that the eternal truths of
the Divine leaves have no need; but however I think $o clear an
agreement is worthy of our con$ideration, which gives us occa-
$ion to adore and admire the greatne$$e of God in his mighty
Works, in that we are $ometimes able, in $ome $ort, to mea$ure
them by the $hort Standard of our Rea$on.</P>
<P>Many Le$$ons al$o may be deduced from the $ame Doctrine,
which I pa$$e by, for that every man of him$elf may ea$ily know
them, having once $tabli$hed this Maxime; That it is not po$$i-
ble to pronounce any thing, of a certainty, touching the quantity
of Running Waters, by con$idering only the $ingle vulgar mea-
$ure of the Water wichout the velocity; and $o on the contrary,
he that computes only the velocity, without the mea$ure, $hall
commit very great errours; for treating of the mea$ure of Run-
ning Waters, it is nece$$ary, the water being a body, in handling
its quantity, to con$ider in it all the three dimen$ions of breadth,
depth, and length: the two fir$t dimen$ions are ob$erved by all
in the common manner, and ordinary way of mea$uring Running
Waters; but the third dimen$ion of length is omitted; and hap-
ly $uch an over$ight is committed, by rea$on the length of Run-
<foot>ning</foot>
<p n=>33</p>
ning Water is reputed in $ome $en$e infinite, in that it never cea-
$eth to move away, and as infinite is judged incomprehen$ible;
and $uch as that there is no exact knowledge to be had thereof;
&amp; $o there comes to be no account made thereof; but if we $hould
make $trict reflection upon our con$ideration of the velocity of
Water, we $hould find, that keeping account of the $ame, there
is a reckoning al$o made of the length; fora$much as whil$t we
$ay, the Water of $uch a Spring runs with the velocity of pa$$ing
a thou$and or two thou$and paces an hour: this in $ub$tance is
no other than if we had $aid, $uch a Fountain di$chargeth in an
hour a Water of a thou$and or two thou$and paces long. So
that, albeit the total length of Running water be incomprehen-
$ible, as being infinite, yet neverthele$$e its rendered intelligible
by parts in its velocity. And $o much $ufficeth to have hinted
about this matter, hoping to impart on $ome other occa$ion other
more accurate Ob$ervations in this affair.</P>

<P>It is to be $uppo$ed, that we $peak of Rivers, when they are at

<head>FIRST.</head>
<P>If a River $hall be cut by a Plane at right angles to the $urface
of the water of the River, and to the banks of the River,
that $ame dividing Plane we call the Section of the River; and
this Section, by the Suppo$itions above, $hall be a right angled
Parallelogram.</P>

<P>Sections equally $wift, and that di$charge equal quantity of
Water, in equal time, $hall be equal.</P>
<head>AXIOME III.</head>
<P>Sections equal, and that di$charge equal quantities of Water

<P>When Sections are unequal, but equally $wift, the quanti-
ty of the Water that pa$$eth through the fir$t Section,
$hall have the $ame proportion to the quantity that pa$-
$eth through the Second, that the fir$t Section hath to the $econd

<P>If the Sections $hall be equal, and of unequal velocity, the
quantity of the Water that pa$$eth through the fir$t, $hall
have the $ame proportion to that which pa$$eth through the
$econd, that the velocity of the fir$t Section, $hall have to the
velocity of the $econd Section. Which al$o is manife$t, becau$e

pa$$eth, dependeth on the velocity.</P>
<head><I>PETITION.</I></head>
<P>A Section of a River being given, we may $uppo$e another

locity.</P>
<foot>PRO.</foot>
<p n=>37</p>
<head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
<P><I>The Sections of the $ame River di$charge equal quan-
tities of Water in equal times, although the Secti-
ons them$elves he unequal.</I></P>
<P>Let the two Sections be A and B, in the River C, running
from A, towards B; I $ay, that they di$charge equal quan-
tity of Water in equal times; for if greater quantity of Wa-
ter $hould pa$s through A, than pa$$eth through B, it would
<fig>
follow that the Water in the intermediate $pace of the River C,
would increa$e continually, which is manife$tly fal$e, but if
more Water $hould i$$ue through the Section B, than entreth at
the Section A, the Water in the intermediate $pace C, would
grow continually le$s, and alwaies ebb, which is likewi$e fal$e;
therefore the quantity of Water that pa$$eth through the Secti-
on B, is equal to the quantity of Water which pa$$eth through
the Section A, and therefore the Sections of the $ame River di$-
charge, <I>&amp;c.</I> Which w s to be demon$trated.</P>
<head>PROPOSITION II.</head>
<P><I>In two Sections of Rivers, the quantity of the Water
which pa$$eth by one Section, is to that which pa$-
$eth by the $econd, in a Proportion compounded of
the proportions of the fir$t Section to the $econd, and
of the velocitie through the first, to the velocitie
of the $econd.</I></P>
<P>I Et A, and B be two Sections of a River; I $ay, that the
quantity of Water which pa$$eth through A, is to that which
pa$$eth through B, in a proportion compounded of the pro-
portions of the fir$t Section A, to the Section B; and of the velo-
city through A, to the velocity through B: Let a Section be
<p n=>40</p>
$uppo$ed equal to the Section A, in magnitude; but of velocity
equal to the Section B, and let it be G, and as the Section A is
<fig>
to the Section B, $o let the line F be to the line D; and as the
velocity A, is to the velocity by B, $o let the line D be to the
line R: Therefore the Water which pa$$eth thorow A, $hall be
to that which pa$$eth through G (in regard the Sections A and
G are of equal bigne$s, but of unequal velocity) as the velocity
through A, to the velocity through G; But as the velocity
through A, is to the velocity through G, $o is the velocity through
A, to the velocity through B; namely, as the line D, to the
line R: therefore the quantity of the Water which pa$$e the
through A, $hall be to the quantity which pa$$eth through G, as
the line D is to the line R; but the quantity which pa$$eth
through G, is to that which pa$$eth through B, (in regard the
Sections G, and B, are equally $wift) as the Section G to the Se-
ction B; that is, as the Section A, to the Section B; that is, as
the line F, to the line D: Therefore by the equal and perturbed
proportionality, the quantity of the Water which pa$$eth through
A, hath the $ame proportion to that which pa$$eth through B,
that the line F hath to the line R; but F to R, hath a proportion
compounded of the proportions of F to D, and of D to R; that
is, of the Section A to the Section B; and of the velocity through
A, to the velocity through B. Therefore al$o the quantity of
Water which pa$$eth through the Section A, $hall have a propor-
tion to that which pa$$eth through the Section B, compounded of
the proportions of the Section A, to the Section B; and of
the velocity through A, to the velocity through B: And
therefore in two Sections of Rivers, the quantity of Water which
pa$$eth by the fir$t, <I>&amp;c.</I> which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE.</I></head>
<P>The $ame followeth, though the quantity of the Water which
pa$$eth through the Section A, be equal to the quantity of
Water which pa$$eth through the Section B, as is manife$t by the
$ame demon$tration.</P>
<foot>PROPO-</foot>
<p n=>41</p>
<head>PROPOSITION III.</head>
<P><I>In two Sections unequal, through which pa$s equal
quantities of Water in equal times, the Sections
have to one another, reciprocal proportion to their
velocitie.</I></P>
<P>Let the two unequal Sections, by which pa$s equal quantities
of Water in equal times be A, the greater; and B, the le$$er:
I $ay, that the Section A, $hall have the $ame Proportion
to the Section B, that reciprocally the velocity through B, hath to
the velocity through A; for $uppo<*>ing that as the Water that
pa$$eth through A, is to that which pa$$eth through B, $o is the
<fig>
line E to the line F: therefore the quantity of water which pa$-
$eth through A, being equal to that which pa$$eth through B,
the line E $hall al$o be equal to the line F: Suppo$ing moreover,
That as the Section A, is to the Section B, $o is the line F, to the
line G; and becau$e the quantity of water which pa$$eth
through the Section A, is to that which pa$$eth through the
Section B, in a proportion compo$ed of the proportions of the
Section A, to the Section B, and of the velocity through A, to the
velocity through B; therefore the line E, $hall be the line to F, in
a proportion compounded of the $ame proportions; namely, of
the proportion of the Section A, to the Section B, and of the ve-
locity through A, to the velocity through B; but the line E, hath
to the line G, the proportion of the Section A, to the Section B,
therefore the proportion remaining of the line G, to the line F,
$hall be the proportion of the velocity through A, to the velocity
through B; therefore al$o the line G, $hall be to the line E, as
the velocity by A, to the velocity by B: And conver$ly, the ve-
locity through B, $hall be to the velocity through A, as the line
E, to the line G; that is to $ay, as the Section A, to the Section B,
and therefore in two Sections, &amp;c. which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<foot>Gggg <I>COROL-</I></foot>
<p n=>42</p>
<head><I>COROLLARIE.</I></head>
<P>Hence it is manife$t, that Sections of the $ame River (which
are no other than the vulgar mea$ures of the River) have
betwixt them$elves reciprocal proportions to their veloci-
ties; for in the fir$t Propo$ition we have demon$trated that the
Sections of the $ame River, di$charge equal quantities of Water
in equal times; therefore, by what hath now been demon$trated
the Sections of the $ame River $hall have reciprocal proportion
to their velocities; And therefore the $ame running water chan-
geth mea$ure, when it changeth velocity; namely, increa$eth the
mea$ure, when it decrea$eth the velocity, and decrea$eth the
mea$ure, when it increa$eth the velocity.</P>
<P>On which principally depends all that which hath been $aid
above in the <I>Di$cour$e,</I> and ob$erved in the <I>Corollaries</I> and <I>Ap-
pendixes</I>; and therefore is worthy to be well under$tood and
heeded.</P>
<head>PROPOSITION IV.</head>
<P><I>If a River fall into another River, the height of the
fir$t in its own Chanel $hall be to the height that it
$hall make in the $econd Chanel, in a proportion
compounded of the proportions of the breadth of
the Chanel of the $econd, to the breadth of the
Chanel of the fir$t, and of the velocitie acquired in
the Chanel of the $econd, to that which it had in
its proper and first Chanel.</I></P>
<P>Let the River A B, who$e height is A C, and breadth C B,
that is, who$e Section is A C B; let it enter, I $ay, into a-
nother River as broad as the line E F, and let it therein make
the ri$e or height D E, that is to $ay, let it have its Section in
the River whereinto it falls D E F; I $ay, that the height A C
hath to the height D E the proportion compounded of the pro-
portions of the breadth E F, to the breadth C B, and of the ve-
locity through D F, to the velocity through A B. Let us $up-
po$e the Section G, equal in velocity to the Section A B, and in
breadth equal to E F, which carrieth a quantity of Water e-
qual to that which the Section A B carrieth, in equal times,
and con$equently, equal to that which D F carrieth. Moreover,
as the breadth E F is to the breadth C B, $o let the line H be to
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>43</p>
the line I; and as the velocity of D F is to the velocity of A B,
$o let the line I be to the line L; becau$e therefore the two
Sections A B and G are equally $wift, and di$charge equal quan-
tity of Water in equal times, they $hall be equal Sections; and
<fig>
therefore the height of A <I>B</I> to the height of G, $hall be as the
breadth of G, to the breadth of A <I>B,</I> that is, as E F to C <I>B,</I>
that is, as the line H to the line I: but becau$e the Water which
pa$$eth through G, is equal to that which pa$$eth through D E F,
therefore the Section G, to the Section D E F, $hall have the re-
ciprocal proportion of the velocity through D E F, to the velo-
city through G; but al$o the height of G, is to the height D E,
as the Section G, to the Section D E F: Therefore the height of
G, is to the height D E, as the velocity through D E F, is to the
velocity through G; that is, as the velocity through D E F, is to
the velocity through A <I>B</I>; That is, finally, as the line I, to the
line L; Therefore, by equal proportion, the height of <I>A B,</I> that
is, A C, $hall be to the height D E; as H to L, that is, com-
pounded of the proportions of the breadth E F, to the breadth
C <I>B,</I> and of the velocity through D F, to the velocity through
A <I>B</I>: So that if a River fall into another River, &amp;c. which was
to be demon$trated.</P>

<head>PROPOSITION V.</head>
<P><I>If a River di$charge a certain quantitie of Water
in a certain time; and after that there come into it
a Flood, the quantity of Water which is di$char-
ged in as much time at the Flood, is to that which
was di$charged before, whil$t the River was low,
in a proportion compounded of the proportions of
the velocity of the Flood, to the velocity of the first
Water, and of the height of the Flood, to the
height of the first Water.</I></P>
<P>Suppo$e a River, which whil$t it is low, runs by the Section
AF; and after a Flood cometh into the $ame, and runneth
through the Section D F, I $ay, that the quantity of the Wa-
ter which is di$charged through D F, is to that which is di$charged
<fig>
through A F, in a proportion compounded of the proportions of
the velocity through D F, to the velocity through A F, and of
the height D <I>B,</I> to the height A <I>B</I>; As the velocity through DF
is to the velocity through A F, $o let the line R, to the line S;
and as the height D <I>B</I> is to the height A <I>B,</I> $o let the line S, to
the line T; and let us $uppo$e a Section L M N, equal to D F
in height and breadth; that is L M equal to D <I>B,</I> and M N equal
to <I>B F</I>; but let it be in velocity equal to the Section A F, there-
fore the quantity of Water which runneth through D F, $hall be
to that which runneth through LN, as the velocity through DF,
is to the velocity through L N, that is, to the velocity through
<I>A F</I>; and the line R being to the line S, as the velocity through
D <I>F,</I> to the velocity through <I>A F</I>; therefore the quantity which
runneth through D <I>F,</I> to that which runneth through L N, $hall
have the proportion of R to S; but the quantity which runneth
through L N, to that which runneth through <I>A F,</I> (the Sections
<foot>being</foot>
<p n=>45</p>
being equally $wift) $hall be in proportion as the Section <I>L</I> N, to
the Section A F; that is, as D B, to A B; that is as the line S, to
the line T: Therefore by equal proportion, the quantity of the
water which runneth through D F, $hall be in proportion to that
which runneth through A F, as R is to T; that is, compounded of
the proportions of the height D B, to the height A B, and of the
velocity through <I>D F,</I> to the velocity through <I>A F</I>; and therefore
if a River di$charge a certain quantity, <I>&amp;c.</I> which was to be de-

<P><I>If two equal $treams of the $ame Torrent, fall into a
River at divers times, the heights made in the Ri-
ver by the Torrent, $hall have between them-
$elves the reciprocal proportion of the velocities

<P>Let A and B, be two equal $treams of the $ame Torrent,
which falling into a River at divers times, make the heights
C D, and F G; that is the $tream A, maketh the height
C D, and the $tream B, maketh the height F G; that is, Let
their Sections in the River, into which they are fallen, be C E,
and FH; I $ay, that the height C D, $hall be to the height F G,
in reciprocal proportion, as the velocity through F H, to the ve-
locity through C E; for the quantity of water which pa$$eth
through A, being equal to the quantity which pa$$eth through B,
in equal times; al$o the quantity which pa$$eth through C E, $hall

<head>OF THE
MENSURATION
OF
Running Waters.</head>
<head><I>Lib.</I> II.</head>
<P>Having, in the clo$e of my Treati$e of the
Men$uration of Running Waters promi$ed
to declare upon another occa$ion other par-
ticulars more ob$cure, and of very great
concern upon the $ame argumement: I now
do perform my promi$e on the occa$ion
that I had the pa$t year 1641. to propound
my thoughts touching the $tate of the Lake
of <I>Venice,</I> a bu$ine$s certainly mo$t important, as being the
concernment of that mo$t noble and mo$t admirable City; and
indeed of all <I>Italy,</I> yea of all <I>Europe, A$ia, &amp; Africa</I>; &amp; one may
truly $ay of all the whole World. And being to proceed according
to the method nece$$ary in Sciences, I wil propo$e, in the fir$t place
certain Definitions of tho$e Terms whereof we are to make u$e
in our Di$cour$e: and then, laying down certain Principles we
will demon$trate $ome Problemes and Theoremes nece$$ary for
the under$tanding of tho$e things which we are to deliver; and
moreover, recounting $undry ca$es that have happened, we will
prove by practice, of what utility this contemplation of the
Mea$ure of Running Waters is in the more important affairs both
Publique and Private.</P>
<head>DEFINITION I.</head>
<P>Two Rivers are $aid to move with equal velocity, when in e-
qual times they pa$$e $paces of equal length.</P>
<head>DEFINITION II.</head>
<P>Rivers are $aid to move with like velocity, when their propor-
tional parts do move alike, that is, the upper parts alike to
the upper, and the lower to the lower; $o that if the upper
part of one River $hall be more $wift than the upper part of ano-
ther; then al$o the lower part of the former $hall be more $wift
than the part corre$pondent to it in the $econd, proportionally.</P>
<foot><I>DEFI-</I></foot>
<p n=>48</p>
<head>DEFINITON III.</head>
<P>To mea$ure a River, or running Water, is in our $en$e to finde
out how many determinate mea$ures, or weights of Water
in a given time pa$$eth through the River, or Channel of the
Water that is to be mea$ured.</P>
<head>DEFINITION IV.</head>
<P>If a Machine be made either of Brick, or of Stone, or of
Wood, $o compo$ed that two $ides of the $aid Machine be
placed at right angles upon the ends of a third $ide, that is
$uppo$ed to be placed in the bottom of a River, parallel to the
Horizon, in $uch a manner, that all the water which runneth
through the $aid River, pa$$eth thorow the $aid Machine: And
if all the water coming to be diverted
<fig>
that runneth through the $aid River, the
upper $uperficies of that third $ide placed
in the bottom do remain uncovered
and dry, and that the dead water be not
above it; This $ame Machine $hall be
<marg>* Or Sluice.</marg>
called by us ^{*} REGULATOR: And that third $ide of the
Machine which $tandeth Horizontally is called the bottom of
the Regulator; and the other two $ides, are called the banks of
the Regulator; as is $een in this fir$t Figure: A B C D, $hall be
the Regulator; B C the bottom; and the other two $ides A B,
and C D are its banks.</P>
<head>DEFINITION V.</head>
<P>By the quick height, we mean the Perpendicular from the upper
$uperficies of the River, unto the upper $uperficies of the bot-
tom of the Regulator; as in the foregoing Figure the line. G H.</P>
<head>DEFINITION VI.</head>
<P>If the water of a <I>R</I>iver be $uppo$ed to be marked by three
$ides of a Regulator, that Rightangled Parallelogram compre-
hended between the banks of the Regulator, and the bottom,
and the $uperficies of the Water is called a Section of the
River.</P>
<foot>ANNOTA-</foot>
<p n=>49</p>
<head>ANNOTATION.</head>
<P>Here it is to be noted, that the River it $elf may have $undry
and divers heights, in $everal parts of its Chanel, by rea$on of
the various velocities of the water, and its mea$ures; as hath
been demon$trated in the fir$t book.</P>
<head>SUPPOSITION I.</head>
<P>It is $uppo$ed, that the Rivers equal in breadth, and quick
height, that have the $ame inclination of bed or bottom, ought
al$o to have equal velocities, the accidental impediments being
removed that are di$per$ed throughout the cour$e of the water,
and ab$tracting al$o from the external windes, which may velo-
citate, and retard the cour$e of the water of the River.</P>
<head>SUPPOSITION II.</head>
<P>Let us $uppo$e al$o, that if there be two Rivers that are in
their beds of equal length, and of the $ame inclination, but of
quick heights unequal, they ought to move with like velocity,
according to the $en$e explained in the $econd definition.</P>
<head>SUPPOSITION III.</head>
<P>Becau$e it will often be requi$ite to mea$ure the time exactly
in the following Problems, we take that to be an excellent
way to mea$ure the time, which was $hewed me many years $ince
by <I>Signore Galil&aelig;o Galil&aelig;i,</I> which is as followeth.</P>
<P>A $tring is to be taken three Roman feet long, to the end of
which a Bullet of Lead is to be hanged, of about two or three
ounces; and holding it by the other end, the Plummet is to be
removed from its perpendicularity a Palm, more or le$s, and then
let go, which will make many $wings to and again, pa$$ing and
repa$$ing the Perpendicular, before that it $tay in the $ame: Now
it being required to mea$ure the time that is $pent in any what-
$oever operation, tho$e vibrations are to be numbred, that are
made whil$t the work la$teth; and they $hall be $o many $econd
minutes of an hour, if $o be, that the $tring be three Roman feet
long, but in $horter $trings, the vibrations are more frequent, and
in longer, le$s frequent; and all this $till followeth, whether the
Plummet be little or much removed from its Perpendicularity, or
whether the weight of the Lead be greater or le$$er.</P>

<head>PROPOSITION I. PROBLEME I.</head>
<P><I>Achanel of Running-Water being given, the breadth
of which pa$sing through a Regulator, is three
Palms; and the height one Palm, little more or
le$s, to mea$ure what water pa$$eth through the
Regulator in a time given.</I></P>
<P>Fir$t, we are to dam up the Chanel; $o that there pa$s not any
water below the Dam; then we mu$t place in the $ide of the
Chanel, in the parts above the Regulator three, or four, or five
Bent-pipes, or Syphons, according to the quantity of the water
that runneth along the Chanel; in $uch $ort, as that they may
drink up, or draw out of the Chanel all the water that the Cha-
nel beareth (and then $hall we know that the Syphons drink up
all the water, when we $ee that the water at the Dam doth nei-
ther ri$e higher, nor abate, but alwaies keepeth in the $ame Le-
vel.) The$e things being prepared, taking the In$trument to
mea$ure the time, we will examine the quantity of the water that
i$$ueth by one of tho$e Syphons in the $pace of twenty vibrations,
and the like will we do one by one with the other Syphons; and
then collecting the whole $umme, we will $ay, that $o much is
the water that pa$$eth and runneth thorow the Regulator or
Chanel (the Dam being taken away) in the $pace of twenty $e-
cond minutes of an hour; and calculating, we may ea$ily reduce
it to hours, dayes, months, and years: And it hath fallen to my
turn to mea$ure this way the waters of Mills and Fountains, and I
have been well a$$ured of its exactne$s, by often repeating the
$ame work.</P>
<head>CONSIDERATION.</head>
<P>And this method mu$t be made u$e of in mea$uring the waters,
that we are to bring into Conducts, and carry into Cities
and Ca$tles, for Fountains; and that we may be able afterwards
to divide and $hare them to particular per$ons ju$tly; which will
prevent infinite $uits and controver$ies that every day happen in
the$e matters..</P>

<head>PROPOSITION II. THEOREM I.</head>
<P><I>If a River moving with $uch a certain velocitie
through its Regulator, $hall have a given quick
height, and afterwards by new water $hall increa$e
to be double, it $hall al$o increa$e double in ve-
locitie.</I></P>
<P>Let the quick height of a River in the Regulator A B C D,
be the perpendicular F B, and afterwards, by new water that
is added to the River, let the water be $uppo$ed to be rai$-
ed to G, $o that G B may be double to E B. I $ay, that all the
water G C $hall be double in velocity to
<fig>
that of E C: For the water G F, having
for its bed the bottom E F, equally in-
clined as the bed B C, and its quick
height G E being equal to the quick
height E C, and having the $ame breadth
B C, it $hall have of it $elf a velocity e-
qual to the velocity of the fir$t water
F C: but becau$e, be$ides its own moti-
on, which is imparted to it by the motion of the water E C, it
hath al$o over and above its own motion, the motion of E C. And
becau$e the two waters G C, and E C, are alike in velocity, by
the third Suppo$ition; therefore the whole water G C $hall be
double in velocity to the water E C; which was that which we
were to demon$trate.</P>
<P><I>This demon$tration is not here in$erted, as perfect, the Authour ha-
ving by $everal letters to his friends confe$$ed him$elf un$atisfi-
ed therewith; and that he intended not to publi$h the</I> Theorem
<I>without a more $olid demon$tration, which he was in hope to light
upon. But being overtaken by Death, he could not give the
fini$hing touch either to this, or to the rest of the $econd Book. In
con$ideration of which, it $eemed good to the Publi$her of the
$ame, rather to omit it, than to do any thing contrary to the mind of
the Authour. And this he hints, by way of adverti$ement, to
tho$e that have Manu$cript Copies of this Book, with the $aid de-
mon$tration. For this time let the Reader content him$elf with
the knowledge of $o ingenious and profitable a Conclu$ion; of the
truth of which he may, with $mall expence and much plea$ure, be
a$$ured by means of the experiment to be made in the $ame man-
ner, with that which is laid down in the $econd Corollary of</I>
<foot>Hhhh 2 <I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>52</p>
<I>the fourth</I> Theorem <I>of this, with its Table, and the u$e there-
of annexed.</I></P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE</I></head>
<P>Hence it followeth, that when a River increa$eth in quick
height by the addition of new water, it al$o increa$eth in ve-
locity; $o that the velocity hath the $ame proportion to the velo-
city that the quick height hath to the quick height; as may be
demon$trated in the $ame manner.</P>
<head>PROPOS. III. PROBLEME II.</head>
<P><I>Achanel of Water being given who$e breadth exceeds not
twenty Palms, or thereabouts, and who$e quick beight
is le$s than five Palms, to mea$ure the quantity of the
Water that runneth thorow the Chanel in a time
given.</I></P>
<P>Place in the Chanel a Regulator, and ob$erve the quick
height in the $aid Regulator; then let the water be turned
away from the Chanel by a Chanellet of three or four Palms
in breadth, or thereabouts: And that being done, mea$ure the
quantity of the water which pa$$eth thorow the $aid Chanellet,
as hath been taught in the $econd Propo$ition; and at the $ame
time ob$erve exactly how much the quick height $hall be abated
in the greater Chanel, by means of the diver$ion of the Chancl-
let; and all the$e particulars being performed, multiply the quick
height of the greater Chanel into it $elf, and likewi$e multiply
into it $elf the le$$er height of the $aid bigger Chanel, and the
le$$er $quare being taken, from the greater, the remainder $hall
have the $ame proportion to the whole greater $quare, as the wa-
ter of the Chanellet diverted, hath to the water of the bigger
Chanel: And becau$e the water of the Chanellet is known by
the Method laid down in the fir$t Theorem, and the terms of the
Theorem being al$o known, the quantity of the water which run-
neth thorow the bigger Chanel, $hall be al$o known by the Gol-
den <I>R</I>ule, which was that that was de$ired to be known. We
will explain the whole bu$ine$s by an example.</P>
<P>Let a Chanel be, for example, 15 Palms broad, its quick height
before its diver$ion by the Chanellet $hall be $uppo$ed to be 24
inches; but after the diver$ion, let the quick height of the Chanel
be onely 22 inches. Therefore the greater height to the le$$er,
is as the number 11. to 12. But the $quare of 11. is 121, and the
$quare of 12. is 144, the difference between the $aid le$$er
<foot>$quare</foot>
<p n=>53</p>
$quare and the greater is 23. Therefore the diverted water, is
to the whole water, as 23. to 144: which is well near as 1 to
6 6/23: and that is the proportion that the quantity of the water
which runneth through the Chanellet $hall have, to all the water
that runneth thorow the great Chanel. Now if we $hould finde
by the Rule mentioned above in the fir$t Propo$ition, that the
quantity of the water that runneth through the Chanellet, is
<I>v. g.</I> an hundred Barrels, in the $pace of 15 $econd minutes of
an hour, it is manife$t, that the water which runneth through the
great Chanel in the $aid time of 35 min. $ec. $hall be about 600
Barrels.</P>
<head><I>The $ame operation performed another way.</I></head>
<P>And becau$e very often in applying the Theory to Practice
it happeneth, that all the nece$$ary particulars in the The-
ory cannot $o ea$ily be put in execution; therefore we will
here add another way of performing the $ame Problem, if it $hould
chance to happen that the Chanellet could not commodiou$ly be
diverted from the great Chanel, but that it were ea$ier for the
water of another $maller Chanel to be brought into the greater
Chanel; which water of the $maller Chanel might be ea$ily mea-
$ured, as hath been $hewen in the fir$t Probleme; or in ca$e that
there did fall into a greater Chanel, a le$$er Chanel that might
be diverted and mea$ured. Therefore I $ay in the fir$t ca$e, If
we would mea$ure the quantity of the water that runneth in a
certain time thorow the greater Chanel, into which another le$$er
Chanel that is mea$urable may be brought, we mu$t fir$t exactly
mea$ure the Chanellet, and then ob$erve the quick height of the
greater Chanel, before the introduction of the le$$er; and having
brought in the $aid Chanellet, we mu$t agnin find the propor-
tion that the water of the Chanellet hath to all the water of the
great Ghanel; for the$e terms of the proportion being known, as
al$o the quantity of the water of the Chanellet, we $hall al$o
come to know the quantity of the water that runneth thorow
the great Chanel. It is likewi$e manife$t, that we $hall obtain
our intent, if the ca$e were that there entered into the great
Chanel, another le$$er Chanel that was mea$urable, and that
might be diverted.</P>
<head>CONSIDERATION.</head>
<P>It would be nece$$ary to make u$e of this Doctrine in the di-
$tribution of the waters that are imploy'd to overflow the fields,
as is u$ed in the <I>Bre$ciau, Cremone$e, Bergama$e, Lodigian, Mila-</I>
<foot><I>ne$e,</I></foot>
<p n=>54</p>
<I>ne$e</I> territories, and many other places, where very great $uits
and differences ari$e, which not being to be determined with in-
telligible rea$ons, come oftentimes to be decided, by force of
armes; and in$tead of flowing their Grounds with Waters, they
cruelly flow them with the $hedding of humane blood, impiou$ly
inverting the cour$e of Peace and Ju$tice, $owing $uch di$orders
and feuds, as that they are $ometimes accompanied with the ru-
ine of whole Cities, or el$e unprofitably charge them with vain,
and $ometimes prejudicial expences.</P>
<head>PROPOS. IV. THEOR. II.</head>
<P><I>If a River increa$e in quick height, the quantitie of
Water which the River di$chargeth after the in-
crea$e, hath the Proportion compounded of the
Proportions of the Quick height to the Quick
height, and of the velocity to the velocity.</I></P>
<P>Let there be a River, which whil$t it is low, runneth thorow
the Regulator D F, with the Quick height A B, and after-
wards let a Flood come; and then let it run with the height
D B, I $ay, that the quantity of the Water that is di$charged
through D F, to that which di$chargeth through A F, hath the
proportion compounded of the proportions of the velocity
through D F to the velocity through A F, and of the height
D B to the height A B. As the velocity through D F is to the
velocity through A F, $o let the line R be to the line S; and as
the height D B is to the height A B; $o let the line S be to the
<fig>
line T. And let a Section be $uppo$ed L M N equal to the
Section D F in height and length, but let it be in velocity equal
to the Section AF. Therefore the quantity of the Water that run-
neth through D F to that which runneth through L N, $hall be
<foot>as</foot>
<p n=>55</p>
as the velocity through D F, to the velocity of L N, that is, to
the velocity through L N, that is, to the velocity through <I>A F.</I>
therefore the quantity of Water which runneth through D <I>F,</I>
to that which pa$$eth through L N, $hall have the proportion
that R hath to S; but the quantity of the Water that runneth
through L N, to that which runneth through <I>A F</I>; (the Sections
being equally $wift) $hall have the proportion that the Section
L N hath to the Section A F, that is, that the height <I>B</I> D hath to
the height <I>B</I> A, that is, that S hath to T. Therefore, by equal
proportion, the quantity of the Water which runneth by D F,
to that which runneth by A F, $hall have the proportion of R to
T, that is, $hall be compounded of the proportions of the height
D <I>B,</I> to the height A <I>B</I>; and of the velocity through D F, to
the velocity through A F. And therefore if a River increa$e in
quick height, the quantity of the Water that runneth after the
increa$e, to that which runneth before the increa$e, hath the
proportion compounded, &amp;c. Which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE I.</I></head>
<P>Hence it followeth, that we having $hewn, that the quantity of
the Water which runneth, whil$t the River is high, to that
which ran, whil$t it was low, hath the proportion compounded
of the velocity to the velocity, and of the height to the height.
And it having been demon$trated, that the velocity to the velo-
city is as the height to the height; it followeth, I $ay, that the
quantity of the Water that runneth, whil$t the River is high, to
that which runneth, whil$t it is low, hath duplicate proportion of
the height to the height, that is, the proportion that the $quares
of the heights have.</P>
<head><I>COROLLARIE II.</I></head>
<P>Vpon which things dependeth the rea$on of that which I have
$aid, in my $econd Con$ideration, that if by the diver$ion of
5/9 of the Water that entereth by the Rivers into the Moor or
Fen, the Water be abated $uch a mea$ure, that $ame $hall be
only one third of its whole height; but moreover diverting the 4/9, it
$hall abate two other thirds, a mo$t principal point; and $uch,
that its not having been well under$tood, hath cau$ed very great
di$orders, and there would now, more than ever, follow extream
dammage, if one $hould put in execution the diver$ion of the <I>Sile</I>
and other Rivers; and it is manife$t, that in the $ame manner,
wherewith it hath been demon$trated, that the quantity of the
Water increa$ing quadruple, the height would increa$e onely
<foot>double</foot>
<p n=>56</p>
double, and the quantity increa$ing nonuple, the height increa-
$eth triple; $o that, by adding to units all the odde numbers, ac-
cording to their Series, the heights increa$e according to the na-
tural progre$$ion of all the numbers, from units. As for exam-
ple, there pa$$ing thorow a Regulator $uch a certain quantity of
Water in one time; adding three of tho$e mea$ures, the quick
height is two of tho$e parts, which at fir$t was one; and con-
tinuing to adde five of tho$e $aid mea$ures, the height is three of
tho$e parts which at fir$t were one; and thus adding $even, and
then nine, and then 11. and then 13, &amp;c. the heights $hall be 4.
then 5, then 6. then 7, &amp;c. And for the greater facility of the
Work, we have de$cribed the following Table, of which we will
declare the u$e: The Table is divided into three Series or Pro-
gre$$ions of Numbers: the fir$t Series containeth all the Num-
bers in the Natural Progre$$ion, beginning at a Unit, and is called
the Series of the Heights; the $econd containeth all the odde
numbers, beginning at an unit, and is called the Series of the
Additions: the third containeth all the $quare numbers, begin-
ning at an unit, and is called the Series of Quantity.</P>

<head><I>The u$e of the afore-mentioned Table.</I></head>
<P>Fir$t, if we $uppo$e the whole quick height of a River of Run-
ning Water to be divided into any number of equal parts, at
plea$ure, and would abate the $ame one fift, by means of a divi-
$ron; let there be found in the Table in the Series of heights the
number 5. the denominator of the part which the River is to a-
bate, and take the number that is immediately under it in the
row of Additions, which is 9. which let be $ub$tracted from the
number 25. placed underneath the $ame in the row of Quanti-
ties, the remainder 16. $ignifieth that of the 25. parts of Water
that ran in the River, whil$t it was 5 mea$ures high, there do
onely run 16. parts; $o that to make it abate 1/5 it is nece$$ary to
take 9/25 from the Water that the whole River did carry; $o that
with $ub$tracting $omewhat more than one third of the Water of
the River, it is abated but only one fift.</P>
<P>2. And thus, in the $econd place, if on the contrary, one would
know how much water is to be added to the $aid River to make
it increa$e one fift more in height, $o as that it may run in the
<foot>Regulator</foot>
<p n=>57</p>
Regulator 6. of tho$e parts high; of which it ran before but 5. let
6 be found in the row of heights, and let the number 11. $tand-
ing under the $ame be taken and added to the number 25.
that is placed under the number 9. in the Additions, and 5. in
the heights, and you $hall have 36; which is the quantity of the
water that runneth with the height of the River, when it is high
6 of tho$e parts, whereof it was before but 5.</P>
<P>3. But if it $hould be de$ired, to know how much water it is
requi$ite to add to make the River ri$e $o, as that it may run in
height 8. of tho$e parts of which before it ran but 5; one
ought to take the $um of the number of the Series of Additions
$tanding under 8. 7. and 6, which are 15. 13. and 11. that is, 39.
and this $hall be the $umme that mu$t be added to 25: So that
to make the River to run 8. of tho$e parts in height, of which it
before did run 5, it will be nece$$ary to add 39. of tho$e parts,
of which the River before was 25.</P>
<P>4. Likewi$e the $ame Table giveth the quantity of water
that runneth from time to time through a River, that increa$eth
by the addition of new water to the $ame in one of its heights, the
quantity of its water be known. As for example: If we knew that
the River in one minute of an hour di$chargeth 2500. of tho$e mea-
$ures of water, and runneth in height 5. parts in the Regulator, and
afterwards $hould $ee that it runneth 8 Palms high, finding in the
row of quantity the number placed under 8. which is 64. we would
$ay that the River heightned, carrieth of water 64. of tho$e parts
whereof it carried before but 25; and becau$e before it carried
2500. mea$ures, by the Golden Rule we will $ay, that the River
carrieth 6400. of tho$e mea$ures, of which before it carried 2500.</P>
<P>In this progre$s of Nature, is one thing really curious, and that
at fir$t $ight $eemeth to be $omewhat Paradoxal, that we pro-
ceeding ordinately in the diver$ions and additions, with additi-
ons and diver$ions $o unequal, the abatings do notwith$tanding
alwaies prove equal, and $o do the ri$ings: And who would ever
think that a River in height, <I>v. g.</I> 10. Palms, running and carry-
ing an hundred mea$ures in a minute of an hour, is to abate but
one Palm, onely by the diver$ion of 19. of tho$e mea$ures; and
then again, that the bui$ine$s cometh to that pa$s, that it abateth
likewi$e a Palm by the diver$ion of three onely of tho$e mea$ures,
nay, by the diver$ion of but one mea$ure? and yet it is mo$t
certain: And this truth meets with $o manife$t proofs in experi-
ence, that it is very admirable! And for the full $atisfaction of
tho$e, who not being able to comprehend $ubtil demon$trati-
ons, desire to be clearly inform'd by the matters of fact, and to
$ee with their bobily eyes, and touch with their hands, what their
under$tanding and rea$on cannot reach unto: I will hear add
another very ea$ie way to reduce all to an experiment, the
<foot>Iiii which</foot>
<p n=>58</p>
which may be made in little, in great, or in very great; of
which I make u$e frequently, to the admiration of $uch as $ee it.</P>
<P>I prepared an hundred Siphons, or, if you will, bowed Pipes,
all equal; and placed them at the brim of a Ve$$el, wherein the
water is kept at one and the $ame level (whether all the Syphons
work, or but a certain number of them) the mouths by which
the water i$$ueth being all placed in the $ame level, parallel to
the Horizon; but lower in level than the water in the Ve$$el; and
gathered all the water falling from the Syphons into another
Ve$$el $tanding lower than the former, I made it to run away
thorow a Chanel, in $uch manner inclined, that wanting water
from the Syphons, the $aid Chanel remained quite dry.</P>
<P>And this done, I mea$ured the quick height of the Chanel
with care, and afterwards divided it exactly into 10 equal parts,
and cau$ing 19. of tho$e Syphons to be taken away, $o that the
Chanel did not run water, $ave onely with 81 of tho$e Syphons,
I again ob$erved the quick height of the water in the $ame $ite
ob$erved before, and found that its height was dimini$hed pre-
ci$ely the tenth part of all its fir$t height; and thus continuing to
take away 17. other Syphons, the height was likewi$e dimini$h-
ed 1/1. of all its fir$t quick height; and trying to take away 15.
Syphons, then 13, then 11, then 9, then 7, then 5, and then 3.
alwaies in the$e diver$ions, made in order as hath been $aid, there
en$ued $till an abatement of 1/1. of the whole height.</P>
<P>And here was one thing worthy of ob$ervation, that the water
encrea$ing in [<I>or through</I>] the Chanel, its quick height was diffe-
rent in different $ites of the Chanel, that is $till le$$er, the more
one approached to the Out-let; notwith$tanding which the abate-
ment followed in all places proportionably, that is in all its $ites
the fir$t part of the height of that $ite dimini$hed: And more-
over the water i$$ued from the Chanel, and dilated into a broader
cour$e, from which likewi$e having divers Out-lets and Mouths;
yet neverthele$s in that breadth al$o the quick heights $ucce$$ive-
ly varied and altered in the $ame proportions. Nor did I here
de$i$t my ob$ervation, but the water being dimini$hed, that i$$u-
ed from the Syphons, and there being but one of them left that
di$charged water; I ob$erved the quick height that it made in the
above-$aid $ites, (the which was likewi$e 1/1. of all the fir$t height)
there being added to the water of that Syphon, the water of
three other Syphons; $o that all the water was of 4 Syphons,
and con$equently quadruple to the fir$t Syphon; but the quick
height was onely double, and adding five Siphons, the quick
height became triple, and with adding $even Syphons, the height
increa$ed quadruple; and $o by adding of 9. it increa$ed quin-
tuple, and by adding of 11. it increa$ed $extuple, and by ad-
<foot>ding</foot>
<p n=>59</p>
ding of 13. it increa$ed $eptuple, and by adding of 15. octuple,
and by adding of 17. nonuple, and la$tly by adding 19. Syphons;
$o that all the water was centuple to the water of one Syphon,
yet neverthele$s the quick height of all this water was onely de-
cuple to the fir$t height conjoyned by the water that i$$ued from
one onely Syphon.</P>
<P>For the more clear under$tanding of all which, I have made
the following Figure; in which we have the mouth A, that
maintaineth the water of the Ve$$el B C in the $ame level; though
it continually run; to the brim of the Ve$$el are put 25. Sy-
phons (and there may be many more) divided into 5 Cla$$es,
D E F G H, and the fir$t D, are of one onely Syphon; the $econd
E, of three Syphons; the third F, of five; the fourth G, of 7; the
fifth H, of 9; and one may $uppo$e the $ixth of 11, the $eventh
of 13 Syphons, and $o of the other Cla$$es, all containing in con-
$equent odd numbers $ucce$$ively (we are content to repre$ent in
the Figure no more but the five forenamed Cla$$es to avoid con-
fu$ion) the gathered water D E F G H, which runneth thorow
the Chanel I K L, and falleth into the out-let M N O P; and $o
much $ufficeth for the explanation of this experiment.</P>

<head>CONSIDERATION. I.</head>
<P>And although it $eemeth as if it might prove difficult, and
almo$t impo$$ible to make u$e of the Regulator number, if
one be about to mea$ure the water of $ome great River,
and con$equently would be impo$$ible, or at lea$t very difficult
to reduce the Theory of the fir$t Probleme into practice: Yet ne-
verthele$s, I could $ay that $uch great conceits of mea$uring the
water of a great River, are not to come into the minds of any
but great Per$onages, and potent Princes; of whom it is expected
for their extraordinary concerns, that they will make the$e kinde
of enquiries; as if here in <I>Italy</I> it $hould be of the Rivers <I>Tyber,
Velino, Chiana, Arno, Serchio, Adice,</I> in which it $eemeth real-
ly difficult to apply the <I>R</I>egulator, to finde exactly the quick
height of the <I>R</I>iver: But becau$e in $uch like ca$es $ometimes
it would turn to account to be at $ome charge, to come to the
exact and true knowledge of the quantity of water which that
<I>R</I>iver carrieth, by knowledge whereof, other greater di$-
bur$ments might afterwards be avoided, that would oft times be
made in vain; and prevent the di$gu$ts, which $ometimes happen
among$t Princes: Upon this ground I think it will be well to
$hew al$o the way how to make u$e of the <I>R</I>egulator in the$e
great <I>R</I>ivers; in which if we will but open our eyes, we $hall meet
with good ones, and tho$e made without great co$t or labour,
which will $erve our turn.</P>
<P>For upon $uch like <I>R</I>ivers there are Wears, or Lockes made,
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>61</p>
to cau$e the Waters to ri$e, and to turn them for the $ervice of
Mills, or the like. Now in the$e Ca$es it is $ufficient, that one
erect upon the two extreames of the Weare two Pila$ters either
of Wood or Brick, which with the bottome of the Weare do
compo$e our Regulator, wherewith we may make our de$ired
operation, yea the Chanel it $elf diverted $hall $erve, without
making any other diver$ion or union. And in brief, if the bu-
fine$$es be but managed by a judicious per$on, there may wayes
and helps be made u$e of, according to occa$ion, of which it
would be too tedious to $peak, and therefore this little that hath
been hinted $hall $u$$ice.</P>
<head>CONSIDERATION II.</head>
<P>From what hath been declared, if it $hall be well under-
$tood, may be deduced many benefits and conveniences,
not onely in dividing of Running Waters for infinite u$es
that they are put to in turning of Corne-Mills, Paper-Mills,
Gins, Powder-Mills, Rice-Mills, Iron Mills, Oil-Mills, Saw-
ing-Mills, Mirtle-Mills, Felling-Mills, Fulling-Mills, Silk-Mills,
and $uch other Machines; but al$o in ordering Navigable Cha-
nels, diverting Rivers and Chanels of Waters, or terminating
and limiting the $izes of Pipes for Fountains: In all which af-
fairs there are great errours committed, to the lo$$e of much
expence, the Chanels and Pipes that are made, $ometimes not
being $ufficient to carry the de$igned Waters, and $ometimes they
are made bigger than is nece$$ary; which di$orders $hall be
avoided, if the Engineer be advi$ed of the things above$aid: and
in ca$e that to the$e Notions there be added the knowledge of
Philo$ophy and Mathematicks, agreeable to the $ublime Di$co-
veries of <I>Signore Galil&aelig;o,</I> and the further improvement thereof
by <I>Signore Evangeli$ta Torricelli,</I> Mathematician to the Grand
<I>Duke of Tu$cany,</I> who hath $ubtilly and admirably handled this
whole bu$ine$$e of Motion, one $hall then come to the know-
ledge of particular notions of great curio$ity in the Theoricks,
and of extraordinary benefit in the Practicks that daily occur in
the$e bu$ine$$es.</P>
<P>And to $hew, in effect, of what utility the$e Notions are, I
have thought fit to in$ert, in this place, the Con$iderations by
me made upon the Lake of <I>Venice,</I> and to repre$ent,
at large, by the experience of the la$t year 1641. the mo$t Se-
rene <I>Erizzo,</I> then Duke of the $aid Republique. Being
therefore at <I>Venice,</I> in the year afore$aid, I was reque$ted by the
mo$t Illu$trious and mo$t Excellent <I>Signore Giovanni Ba$a-</I>
<foot><I>donna</I></foot>
<p n=>62</p>
<I>donna,</I> a Senatour of great worth and merit, that I would inge-
nuou$ly deliver my opinion touching the $tate of the Lake
of <I>Venice</I>; and after I had di$cour$ed with his Honour $eve-
ral times, in the end I had order to $et down the whole
bu$ine$$e in writing, who having afterwards read it privately,
the $aid <I>Signore</I> imparted the $ame, with like privacy, to the
mo$t Serene PRINCE, and I received order to repre$ent the
$ame to the full <I>Colledge,</I> as accordingly I did in the Moneth
of <I>May,</I> the $ame year, and it was as followeth.</P>

<head>CONSIDER ATIONS
Concerning the
LAKE
OF
VENICE.
BY</head>
<head>D. BENEDETTO CASTELLI,
Abbot of S. <I>Benedetto Aloy$io,</I> Mathematician to
Pope <I>VR BAN VIII.</I> and Profe$$or in
ROME.</head>
<head><I>CONSIDERATION I.</I></head>
<P>Though the principal cau$e be but one
onely, that in my judgment threatneth
irreparable ruine to the Lake of
<I>Venice,</I> in the pre$ent $tate in which it
now $tands; Yet neverthele$$e, I think
that two Heads may be con$idered.
And this Con$ideration may peradven-
ture $erve us for to facilitate and explain
the opportune remedies, though not to
render the $tate of things ab$olutely unchangeable and eternal:
an enterprize impo$$ible, and e$pecially in that which having had
$ome beginning, ought likewi$e nece$$arily to have its end; or
at lea$t to prevent the danger for many hundreds of years; and
po$$ibly it may, in the mean time, by the mutation it $elf be
brought into a better condition.</P>
<P>I $ay therefore, that the pre$ent di$order may be con$idered
under two Heads; One is the very notable di$covery of Land
that is ob$erved at the time of low Water, the which, be$ides
the ob$tructing of Navigation in the Lake and al$o in the
Chanels, doth likewi$e threaten another mi$chief and di$order
<foot>worthy</foot>
<p n=>64</p>
worthy of very particular con$ideration, which is, That the Sun
drying up that mudde, e$pecially in the times of hot Summers,
doth rai$e thence the putrified and pernicious vapours, fogs, and
exhalations that infect the Air, and may render the City unha-
bitable.</P>
<P>The $econd Head is the great Stoppage that daily is grow-
ing in the Ports, e$pecially of <I>Venice,</I> at <I>Malamoco</I>; concerning
which matters I will hint certain general points, and then
will proceed to the more particular and important affairs.</P>
<P>And fir$t, I $ay, that I hold it altogether impo$$ible to effect
any thing, though never $o profitable, which doth not bring with
it $ome mi$chief; and therefore the good and the hurt ought to
be very well weighed, and then the le$$e harmful part to be im-
braced.</P>
<P>Secondly, I propo$e to con$ideration, that the $o notable di$-
covery of Earth &amp; Mud, hath not been long ob$erved, as I under-
$tand, from old per$ons that can remember pa$$ages for fifty
years pa$t; which thing being true, as to me it $eemeth mo$t
true, it $hould appear that it could not but be good to reduce
matters to that pa$$e that they were at formerly, (laying a$ide
all affection or pa$$ion that $elf-flattering minds have entertained
for their own conceits) or at lea$t it $hall be nece$$ary $peedily to
con$ult the whole.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I hold that it is nece$$ary to weigh, whether from the
fore$aid di$covery of Land, it followeth, that onely the Earth ri-
$eth, as it is commonly thought by all, without di$pute; or whe-
ther the Waters are abated and faln away; or el$e whether it
proceedeth from both the one and other cau$e. And here it would
be $ea$onable to enquire, what $hare the $aid cau$es may have,
each con$idered apart in the fore$aid effect. For, in the fir$t
ca$e, if the Earth have been rai$ed, it would be nece$$ary to
con$ider of taking it down, and removing it: But if the Wa-
ters have failed or abated, I believe that it would be extreamly ne-
ce$$ary to re$tore and rai$e them: And if both the$e rea$ons have
con$pired in this effect, it will be nece$$ary to remedy them each
apart. And I do, for my part, think, that the $o notable appea-
rance of Shelves at the time of low Water, proceeds principally
from the decrea$e and abatement of the Waters, which may
confidently be affirmed to need no other proof, in regard that the
<I>Brent</I> hath been actually diverted which did formerly di$charge
its Water into the Lake.</P>
<P>As to the other point of the great Stoppage of Ports, I hold,
that all proceedeth from the violence of the Sea, which being
$ometimes di$turbed by windes, e$pecially at the time of the wa-
ters flowing, doth continually rai$e from its bottome immen$e
<foot>heaps</foot>
<p n=>65</p>
heaps of $and, carrying them by the tide; and force of the waves
into the Lake; it not having on its part any $ttength of current
that may rai$e and carry them away, they $ink to the bottom, and
$o they choke up the Ports. And that this effect happeneth in
this manner, we have mo$t frequent experiences thereof along the
Sea-coa$ts: And I have ob$erved in <I>Tu$cany</I> on the <I>Roman-
$hores,</I> and in the Kingdom of of <I>Naples,</I> that when a river fal-
leth into the Sea, there is alwaies $een in the Sea it $elf, at the place
of the rivets out-let, the re$emblance, as it were, of an half-Moon,
or a great $helf of $ettled $and under water, much higher then the
re$t of the $hore, and it is called in <I>Tu$cany, il Cavallo</I>; and here
in <I>Venice, lo Scanto</I>: the which cometh to be cut by the current
of the river, one while on the right $ide, another while on the
left, and $ometimes in the mid$t, according as the Wind fits. And
a like effect I have ob$erved in certain little Rillets of water,
along the Lake of <I>Bol$ena</I>; with no other difference, $ave that of
$mall and great.</P>
<P>Now who$o well con$idereth this effect, plainly $eeth that it
proceeds from no other, than from the contrariety of the $tream
of the River, to the <I>impetus</I> of the Sea waves; $eeing that
great abundance of $and which the Sea continually throws upon
the $hore, cometh to be driven into the Sea by the $tream of the
river; and in that place where tho$e two impediments meet
with equal force, the $and $etleth under water, and thereupon is
made that $ame Shelf or <I>Cavallo</I>; the which if the river carry
water, and that any con$iderable $tore, it $hall be thereby cut
and broken; one while in one place, and another while in ano-
ther; as hath been $aid, according as the Wind blows: And
through that Chanel it is that Ve$$els fall down into the Sea, and
again make to the river, as into a Port. But if the Water of
the river $hall not be continual or $hall be weak, in that ca$e the
force of the Sea-Wind $hall drive $uch a quantity of $and into
the mouth of the Port, and of the river, as $hall wholly choak it
up. And hereupon there are $een along the Sea-$ide, very many
Lakes and Meers, which at certain times of the year abound with
waters, and the Lakes bear down that enclo$ure, and run into
the Sea.</P>
<P>Now it is nece$$ary to make the like reflections on our Ports
of <I>Venice, Malamocco, Bondolo,</I> and <I>Chiozza</I>; which in a certain
$en$e are no other than Creeks, mouths, and openings of the $hore
that parts the Lake from the main Sea; and therefore I hold that
if the Waters in the Lake were plentiful, they would have
$trength to $cowr the mouths of the Ports thorowly, &amp; with great
force; but the Water in the Lake failing, the Sea will with-
out any oppo$al, bring $uch a drift of $and into the Ports; that if
<foot>Kkkk it</foot>
<p n=>66</p>
it doth not wholly choke them up, it $hall render them at lea$t
unprofitable, and impo$$ible for Barks and great Ve$$els.</P>
<P>Many other con$iderations might be propounded concerning
the$e two heads of the $toppage of the Ports, and of the appea-
rance of the Ouze and Mud in the Lakes, but $o much $hall $uf-
fice us to have hinted, to make way for di$cour$ing of the opera-
tions about the oportune remedies.</P>
<P>Yet before that I propound my opinion, I $ay, That I know
very well that my propo$al, at fir$t $ight, will $eem ab$urd and in-
convenient; and therefore, as $uch, will perhaps be rejected by
the mo$t: and $o much the rather, for that it will prove directly
contrary to what hath hitherto been, and as I hear, is intended to
be done. And I am not $o wedded to my opinions, but that I
do con$ider what others may judge thereof: But be it as it will,
I am obliged to $peak my thoughts freely, and that being done,
I will leawe it to wi$er men than my $elf; when they $hall have
well con$idered my rea$ons, to judge and deliberate of the <I>quid
agendum:</I> And if the $entence $hall go again$t me, I appeal to the
mo$t equitable and inexorable Tribunal of Nature, who not
caring in the lea$t to plea$e either one party or another, will be
alwaies a punctual and inviolable executrix of her eternal De-
crees, again$t which neither humane deliberations, nor our vain
de$ires; $hall ever have power to rebell. I added by word of
mouth that which followeth.</P>
<P>Though your Highne$s intere$t your $elf in this Noble Col-
ledge, and cau$e it to be confirmed in the ^{*} Senate by univer$al
<marg>* In <I>Pregadi,</I> a
particular Coun-
cil, the Senators of
which have great
Authority.</marg>
Vote, that the Winds do not blow, that the Sea doth not fluctuate,
that the Rivers do not run; yet $hall the Winds be alwaies deaf,
the Sea $hall be con$tant in its incon$tancy, and the Rivers mo$t
ob$tinate: And the$e $hall be my Judges, and to their determi-
nation I refer my $elf.</P>
<P>By what hath been $aid, in my opinion, that is made very clear
and manife$t, which in the beginning of this di$cour$e I glanced
at; namely, That the whole di$order, although it be divided into
two heads, into the di$covery of the Mud, and of the $toppage
Ports, yet neverthele$s, by the application of one onely remedy,
and that in my e$teem very ea$ie, the whole $hall be removed:
And this it is; That there be re$tored into the Lake as much
Water as can be po$$ible, and in particular from the upper parts
of <I>Venice,</I> taking care that the Water be as free from Mud as is
po$$ible. And that this is the true and real remedy of the prece-
dent di$orders, is manife$t: For in the pa$$age that this Water
$hall make thorow the Lakes, it $hall of it $elf by degrees clear
the Chanels in $undry parts of them, according to the currents
that it $hall $ucce$$ively acquire, and in this manner being di$-
<foot>per$ed</foot>
<p n=>67</p>
per$ed thorow the Lake, it $hall maintain the waters in the $ame,
and in the Chanels much higher, as I $hall prove hereafter; a
thing that will make Navigation commodious; and that, which
moreover is of great moment in our bu$ine$$e; tho$e Shelves
of Mud which now di$cover them$elves at the time of Low-
Waters $hall be alwayes covered, $o that the putrefaction of
the Air $hall al$o be remedied.</P>
<P>And la$tly, this abundance of Water being alwayes to di$-
charge it $elf into the Sea by the Ports, I do not doubt, but that
their bottomes will be $coured. And that the$e effects mu$t fol-
low, Nature her $elf $eemeth to per$wade, there remaining onely
one great doubt, whether that abundance of Water that $hall be
brought into the Lake may be really $ufficient to make the Wa-
ters ri$e $o much as to keep the Shelves covered, and to facilitate
Navigation, which ought to be at lea$t half a ^{*} Brace, or there-
<marg>* A <I>Venice</I> Brace
is 11/16 of our yard.</marg>
abouts. And indeed it $eemeth at fir$t $ight to be impo$$ible,
that the $ole Water of the ^{*} <I>Brent</I> let into the Lake, and di$-
<marg>* A River of
that name.</marg>
per$ed over the $ame, can occa$ion $o notable an height of water;
and the more to confirm the difficulties, one might $ay, reducing
the rea$on to calculation, that in ca$e the <I>Brent</I> were 40. Bra-
ces broad, and two and an half high, and the breadth of the
Lake were 20000. Braces, it would $eem nece$$ary that the
height of the water of the <I>Brent</I> dilated and di$tended thorow
the Lake would be but onely 1/200 of a Brace in height, which is
imperceptible, and would be of no avail to our purpo$e; nay
more, it being very certain that the <I>Brent</I> runneth very muddy
and foul, this would occa$ion very great mi$chief, filling and
contracting the Lake, and for that rea$on this remedy ought, as
pernicious, to be totally excluded and condemned.</P>
<P>I here confe$$e that I am $urprized at the forme of the Argu-
ment, as if I were in a certain manner convinced, that I dare not
adventure to $ay more, or open my mouth in this matter; but
the $trength it $elf of the Argument, as being founded upon
the means of Geometrical and Arithmetical Calculation, hath
opened me the way to di$cover a very crafty fraud that is couch-
ed in the $ame Argument, which fraud I will make out to any
one that hath but any in$ight in <I>Geometry</I> and <I>Arithmetick.</I>
And as it is impo$$ible, that $uch an argument $hould be produced
by any but $uch as have ta$ted of the$e, in $uch affairs, mo$t pro-
fitable, and mo$t nece$$ary Sciences; $o do not I pretend to make
my $elf under$tood, $ave onely by $uch, to whom I will evince
$o clearly, as that more it cannot be de$ired, the errour and fraud
wherein tho$e Ancients and Moderns have been, and alwayes
are intangled, that have in any way yet handled this matter of
con$idering the Mea$ure and Quantity of the Waters that move.
<foot>Kkkk 2 And</foot>
<p n=>68</p>
And $o great is the e$teem that I have for that which I am now
about to $ay touching this particular, that I am content that all
the re$t of my Di$cour$e be rejected; provided, that that be per-
fectly under$tood, which I am hereafter to propo$e, I holding
and knowing it to be a main Principle, upon which all that is
founded that can be $aid either well or hand$omely on this parti-
cular. The other Di$cour$es may have an appearance of being
probable, but this hits the mark as full as can be de$ired, arriving
at the highe$t degree of certainty.</P>
<P>I have, $eventeen years $ince, as I repre$ented to the mo$t Se-
rene Prince, and to the Right Honourable the Pre$ident of the
Lords the Commi$$ioners of the ^{*}Sewers, written a Treati$e of the
<marg>* <I>I. Savii dell'
Acque,</I> a particu-
lar Council that
take care of the
Lakes and other
Aquatick affairs.</marg>
Mea$ure of the waters that move, in which I Geometrically de-
mon$trate and declare this bu$ine$$e, and they who $hall have
well under$tood the ground of my Di$cour$e, will re$t fully $a-
tisfied with that which I am now about to propo$e: But that all
may become rhe more ea$ie, I will more briefly explicate and
declare $o much thereof as I have demon$trated in the Di$cour$e,
which will $uffice for our purpo$e: And if that $hould not be
enough, we have alwayes the experiment of a very ea$ie and
cheap way to clear up the whole bu$ine$$e. And moreover I
will take the boldne$$e to affirm, that in ca$e there $hould not for
the pre$ent any deliberation be made concerning this affair, ac-
cording to my opinion; yet neverthele$$e it will be, at $ome
time or other; or if it be not, things will grow wor$e and
wor$e.</P>
<P>For more clear under$tanding, therefore, it ought to be known,
that it being required, as it is generally u$ed, to mea$ure the wa-
ters of a River, its breadth and its depth is taken, and the$e two
dimen$ions being multiplied together, the product is affirmed to
be the quantity of that River: As for example, if a River $hall
be 100. feet broad, and 20. feet high, it will be $aid, that that
River is 2000 feet of Water, and $o if a Ditch $hall be 15. feet
broad, and 5. feet high, this $ame Ditch will be affirmed to be
75. feet of Water: And this manner of mea$uring Running
Water hath been u$ed by the Ancients, and by Moderns, with
no other difference, $ave onely that $ome have made u$e of the
Foot, others of the Palme, others of the Brace, and others of
other mea$ures.</P>
<P>Now becau$e that in ob$erving the$e Waters that move, I fre-
quently found, that the $ame Water of the $ame River was in
$ome $ites of its Chanel pretty big, and in others much le$$e,
not arriving in $ome places to the twentieth, nor to the hundreth
part of that which it is $een to be in other places; therefore this
vulgar way of mea$uring the Waters that move, for that they did
<foot>not</foot>
<p n=>69</p>
not give me a certain and $table mea$ure and quantity of Water,
began de$ervedly to be $u$pected by me, as difficult and defective,
being alwayes various, and the mea$ure, on the contrary, being
to be alwayes determinate, and the $ame; it is therefore written,
that <I>Pondus &amp; Pondus, Men$ura &amp; Men$ura, utrumque abomi-
nabile e$t apud Deum,</I> Exod. I con$idered that in the Terri-
tory of <I>Bre$cia,</I> my native Countrey, and in other places, where
Waters are divided to overflow the Grounds, by the like way of
mea$uring them, there were committed grievous and mo$t impor-
tant errours, to the great prejudice of the Publique and of Pri-
vate per$ons, neither they that $ell, nor they that buy under-
$tanding the true quantity of that which is $old and bought: In
regard that the $ame $quare mea$ure, as is accu$tomed in tho$e
parts, a$$igned one particular per$on, carried to $ometimes above
twice or thrice as much water, as did the $ame $quare mea$ure a$-
$igned to another. Which thing proveth to be the $ame incon-
venience, as if the mea$ure wherewith Wine and Oil is bought
and $old, $hould hold twice or thrice as much Wine or Oil at one
time as at another. Now this Con$ideration invited my minde
and curio$ity to the finding out of the true mea$ure of Running
Waters. And in the end, by occa$ion of a mo$t important bu-
$ine$$e that I was imployed in $ome years $ince, with great in-
ten$ene$$e of minde, and with the $ure direction of <I>Geometry,</I> I
have di$covered the mi$take, which was, that we being upon the
bu$ine$$e of taking the mea$ure of the Waters that move, do make
u$e of two dimen$ions onely, namely, breadth and depth, keep-
ing no account of the length. And yet the Water being, though
running, a Body, it is nece$$ary in forming a conceit of its quan-
tity, in relation to another, to keep account of all the three Di-
men$ions, that is of length, breadth, and depth.</P>
<P>Here an objection hath been put to me, in behalf of the ordi-
nary way of mea$uring Running Waters, in oppo$ition to what
I have above con$idered and propo$ed: and I was told, Its true,
that in mea$uring a Body that $tands $till, one ought to take all
the three Dimen$ions; but in mea$uring a Body that continually
moveth, as the Water, the ca$e is not the $ame: For the length
is not to be had, the length of the water that moveth being infi-
nite, as never fini$hing its running; and con$equently is incom-
prehen$ible by humane under$tanding, and therefore with rea$on,
nay upon nece$$ity it cometh to be omitted.</P>
<P>In an$wer to this, I $ay, that in the above$aid Di$cour$e, two
things are to be con$idered di$tinctly; Fir$t, whether it be po$$ible
to frame any conceit of the quantity of the Body of the Water
with two Dimen$ions onely. And $econdly, whether this length
be to be found. As to the fir$t, I am very certain that no man, let
<foot>him</foot>
<p n=>70</p>
him be never $o great a Wit, can never promi$e to frame a con-
ceit of the quantity of the Body of Water, without the third
Dimen$ion of length: and hereupon I return to affirm, that the
vulgar Rule of mea$uring Running water is vain and erroneous.
This point being agreed on, I come to the $econd, which is, Whe-
ther the third Dimen$ion of length may be mea$ured. And I $ay,
that if one would know the whole length of the water of a
Fountain or River, thereby to come to know the quantity of all
the Water, it would prove an impo$$ible enterprize, nay the
knowing of it would not be u$eful. But if one would know how
much water a Fountain, or a River carrieth in a determinate time
of an hour, of a day, or of a moneth, &amp;c. I $ay, that it is a very
po$$ible and profitable enquiry, by rea$on of the innumerable
benefits that may be derived thence, it much importing to know
how much Water a Chanel carrieth in a time given; and I have
demon$trated the $ame above in the beginning of this Book; and
of this we $tand in need in the bu$ine$$e of the Lake, that $o we
may be able to determine how much $hall be the height of the
<I>Brent,</I> when it is $pread all over the Lake: For the three dimen-
$ions of a Body being given, the Body is known; and the quan-
tity of a Body being given, if you have but two dimen$ions, the
third $hall be known. And thus diving farther and farther into
this Con$ideration, I found that the Velocity of the cour$e of the
water may be an hundred times greater or le$$er in one part of
its Chanel than in another. And therefore although there $hould
be two mouths of Waters equal in bigne$$e; yet neverthele$s it
might come to pa$$e, that one might di$charge an hundred or a
thou$and times more water than another: and this would be, if
the water in one of the mouths $hould run with an hundred or a
thou$and times greater velocity, than the other; for that it
would be the $ame as to $ay, that the $wifter was an hundred or
a thou$and times longer, than the $lower: and in this manner I
di$covered that to keep account of the velocity, was the keeping
account of the Length.</P>
<P>And therefore it is manife$t, that when two Mouths di$charge
the $ame quantity of Wa r in an equal velocity, it is nece$$ary
that the le$s $wift Mouth be $o much bigger than the more $wift;
as the more $wift exceedeth in velocity the le$s $wift; as for
example.</P>
<P>In ca$e two Rivers $hould carry equal quantity of water in
equal times, but that one of them $hould be four times more
$wift than the other, the more $low $hould of nece$$ity be four
times more large. And becau$e the $ame River in any part
thereof alwaies di$chargeth the $ame quantity of Water in equal
times (as is demon$trated in the fir$t Propo$ition of the fir$t
<foot>Book</foot>
<p n=>71</p>

Book</marg>
Book^{*} of the mea$ure of Running Watets;) but yet doth not
run thorowout with the $ame velocity: Hence it is, that the vul-
gar mea$ures of the $aid River, in divers parts of its Chanel, are
alwaies divers; in$omuch, that if a River pa$$ing through its cha-
nel had $uch velocity, that it ran 100 Braces in the 1/60 of an hour-
and afterwards the $aid River $hould be reduced to $o much tardi,
ty of motion, as that in the $ame time it $hould not run more than
one Brace, it would be nece$$ary that that $ame River $hould be-
come 100. times bigger in that place where it was retarded; I
mean, 100. times bigger than it was in the place where it was
$wifter. And let it be kept well in mind, that this point rightly
under$tood, will clear the under$tanding to di$cover very many
accidents worthy to be known. But for this time let it $uffice,
that we have onely declared that which makes for our purpo$e,
referring apprehen$ive and $tudious Wits to the peru$al of my
aforenamed Treati$e; for therein he $hall finde profit and delight
both together.</P>
<P>Now applying all to our principal intent, I $ay, That by what
hath been declared it is manife$t, that if the <I>Brent</I> were 40. Bra-
ces broad, and 2 1/2 high, in $ome one part of its Chanel, that after-
wards the $ame Water of the <I>Brent</I> falling into the Lake, andpa$-
$ing thorow the $ame to the Sea, it $hould lo$e $o much of its ve-
locity, that it $hould run but one Brace, in the time wherein
whil$t it was in its Chanel at the place afore$aid, it ran 100. Bra-
ces. It would be ab$olutely nece$$ary, that increa$ing in mea-
$ure, it $hould become an hundred times ^{*} thicker; and therefore
<marg>* Deeper.</marg>
if we $hould $uppo$e that the Lake were 20000. Braces, the
<I>Brent</I> that already hath been $uppo$ed in its Chanel 100. Braces,
being brought into the Lake, $hould be 100. times 100. Brates;
that is, $hall be 10000. Braces in thickne$s, and con$equently $hall
be in height half a Brace; that is, 100/200 of a Brace, and not 1/2. of a
Brace, as was concluded in the Argument.</P>
<P>Now one may $ee into what a gro$s errour of 99. in 100. one
may fall through the not well under$tanding the true quantity
of Running Water, which being well under$tood, doth open a
direct way to our judging aright in this mo$t con$iderable affair.</P>
<P>And therefore admitting that wich hath been demon$trated,
I fay, that I would (if it did concern me) greatly encline to con-
$ult upon the returning of the <I>Brent</I> again into the Lake: For it
being mo$t evident, that the <I>Brent</I> in the Chanel of its mouth, is
much $wifter than the <I>Brent</I> being brought into the Lake, it will
certainly follow thereupon, that the thickne$s of the Water of
<I>Brent</I> in the Lake, $hall be $o much greater than that of <I>Brent</I> in
<I>Brent,</I> by how much the <I>Bront</I> in <I>Brent</I> is $wifter than thh <I>Brent</I>
in the Lake.</P>
<foot>1. From</foot>
<p n=>72</p>
<P>1. From which operation doth follow in the fir$t place, that
the Lake being filled and increa$ed by tbe$e Waters, $hall be
more Navigable, and pa$$ible, than at pre$ent we $ee it to be.</P>
<P>2. By the current of the$e Waters, the Chanels will be $cour-
ed, and will be kept clean from time to time.</P>
<P>3. There will not appear at the times of low-waters $o many
Shelves, and $uch heaps of Mud, as do now appear.</P>
<P>4. The Ayr will become more whole$om, for that it $hall not
be $o infected by putrid vapours exhaled by the Sun, $o long as
the Miery Ouze $hall be covered by the Waters.</P>
<P>5. La$tly, in the current of the$e advantagious Waters,, which
mu$t i$$ue out of the Lake into the Sea, be$ides tho$e of the Tyde,
the Ports will be kept $coured, and clear: And this is as much as
I $hall offer for the pre$ent, touching this weighty bui$ine$s; al-
waies $ubmitting my $elf to $ounder judgements.</P>
<P>Of the above-$aid Writing I pre$ented a Copy at <I>Venice,</I> at a
full Colledge, in which I read it all, and it was hearkned to with
very great attention; and at la$t I pre$ented it to the Duke, and
left $ome Copies thereof with $undry Senators, and went my way,
promi$ing with all inten$ene$s to apply my pains with reiterated
$tudies in the publick $ervice; and if any other things $hould come
into my minde, I promi$ed to declare them $incerely, and $o took
leave of <I>His $erenity,</I> and that Noble Council. When I was
returned to <I>Rome,</I> this bu$ine$s night and day continually run-
ning in my mind, I hapned to think of another admirable and
mo$t important conceit, which with effectual rea$ons, confirmed
by exact operations, I with the Divine a$$i$tance, made clear and
manife$t; and though the thing at fir$t $ight $eemed to me a mo$t
extravagant Paradox, yet notwith$tanding, having $atisfied my
$elf of the whole bu$ine$s, I $ent it in writing to the mo$t Illu$tri-
ous and mo$t Noble <I>Signore Gio. Ba$adonna</I>; who after he had
well con$idered my Paper, carried it to the Council; and after
that tho$e Lords had for many months maturely con$idered
thereon, they in the end re$olved to $u$pend the execution of the
diver$ion which they had before con$ulted to make of the River
<I>Sile,</I> and of four other Rivers, which al$o fall into the Lake; a
thing by me blamed in this $econd Paper, as mo$t prejudicial,
and harmful. The writing $pake as followeth.</P>

<head>CONSIDERATIONS
Concerning the
LAKE
OF
VENICE.</head>
<head><I>CONSIDERATION II.</I></head>
<P>If the di$cour$ing well about the truth of
things, Mo$t Serene Prince, were as the
carrying of Burdens, in which we $ee
that an hundred Hor$es carry a greater
weight than one Hor$e onely; it would
$eem that one might make more account
of the opinion of many men, than of
one alone; But becau$e that di$cour$ing
more re$embleth running, than carrying
Burdens, in which we $ee that one Barb alone runneth fa$ter
than an hundred heavy-heel'd Jades; therefore I have ever more
e$teemed one Conclu$ion well managed, and well con$idered by
one under$tanding man, although alone, than the common and
Vulgar opinions; e$pecially, when they concern ab$truce and
arduous points: Nay in $uch ca$es the opinions moulded and
framed by the mo$t ignorant and $tupid Vulgar, have been ever
$u$pected by me as fal$e, for that it would be a great wonder if
in difficult matters a common capacity $hould hit upon that
which is hand$om, good, and true. Hence I have, and do hold
in very great veneration the $umme of the Government of the
mo$t Serene, and eternal Republick of <I>Venice</I>; which although,
as being in nature a Common-wealth, it ought to be governed by
the greater part; yet neverthele$s, in arduous affairs, it is alwaies
directed by the Grave Judgement of few, and not judged blindly
<foot>Llll by</foot>
<p n=>74</p>
by the <I>Plebeian</I> Rout. Tis true, that he that propoundeth Pro-
po$itions far above the reach of common capacity, runneth a
great hazard of being very often condemned without further Pro-
ce$s, or knowledge of the Cau$e; but yet for all that, the truth
is not to be de$erted in mo$t weighty affairs, but ought rather to
be explained in due place and time with all po$$ible per$picuity;
that $o being well under$tood, and con$idered, it may come after-
wards for the Common good to be embraced.</P>
<P>This which I $peak in general, hath often been my fortune in
very many particulars, not onely when I have kept within the
bounds of meer $peculation, but al$o when I have chanced to de-
$cend to Practice, and to Operations: and your Highne$s know-
eth very well what befel me the la$t Summer 1641. when in obe-
dience to your Soveraign Command, I did in full Colledge repre-
$ent my thoughts touching the $tate of the Lake of <I>Venice</I>; for
there not being $uch wanting, who without $o much as vouch-
$afing to under$tand me, but having onely had an inkling, and
bad apprehen$ion of my opinion, fell furiou$ly upon me, and by
violent means both with the Pen and Pre$s, full of Gall, did abu$e
me in reward of the readine$s that I had expre$t to obey and
$erve them: But I was above mea$ure encouraged and plea$ed, to
$ee that tho$e few who vouch$afed to hear me, were all either
thorowly per$waded that my opinion was well grounded, or at
lea$t $u$pended their prudent verdict to more mature deliberati-
on. And though at the fir$t bout I chanced to propo$e a thing
that was totally contrary to the mo$t received and antiquated
opinion, and to the re$olutions and con$ultations taken above an
hundred years ago: Moved by the$e things, and to $atisfie al$o
to the promi$e that I had made of tendering unto them what
$hould farther offer it $elf unto me touching the $ame bu$ine$s; I
have re$olved to pre$ent to the Throne of your Highne$s, another
Con$ideration of no le$s importance, which perhaps at fir$t $ight
will appear a $tranger Paradox; but yet brought to the Te$t and
Touch-$tone of experience, it $hall prove mo$t clear and evident.
If it $hall be accounted of, $o that it $ucceedeth to the benefit of
your Highne$s, I $hall have obtained my defire and intent: And
if not, I $hall have $atisfied my $elf, and $hall not have been
wanting to the Obligation of your mo$t faithful Servant, and na-
tive $ubject.</P>
<P>That which I propounded in the Mouths pa$s, touching the
mo$t important bu$ine$s of the Lake, though it did onely expre$-
ly concern the point of the diver$ion of the Mouth of the Lake,
already made and put in execution; yet it may be under$tood
and applyed al$o to the diver$ion under debate, to be made of
the other five Rivers, and of the <I>Sile</I> in particular.</P>
<foot>Now</foot>
<p n=>75</p>
<P>Now touching this, I had the fortune to offer an admirable
accident that we meet with when we come to the effect, which
I verily believe will be an utter ruine to the Lake of <I>Ve-
nice.</I></P>
<P>I $ay therefore, that by diverting the$e five Rivers that re-
main, although their water that they di$charge for the pre$ent in-
to the Lake is not all taken together 4/5 parts of what the <I>Brent</I>
alone did carry, yet neverthele$$e the abatement of the water of
the Lake which $hall en$ue upon this la$t diver$ion of four parts,
which was the whole water, $hall prove double to that which hath
happened by the diver$ion of <I>Brent</I> onely, although that the
<I>Brent</I> alone carried five parts of that water, of which the Rivers
that are to be diverted carry four: A wonder really great, and
altogether unlikely; for the reducing all this Propo$ition to be
under$tood, is as if we $hould $ay, that there being given us
three Rivers, of which the fir$t di$chargeth five parts, the $econd
three, and the third one, and that from the diver$ion of the
fir$t, there did follow $uch a certain abatement or fall; from
the taking away of the $econd there ought to follow al$o $o
much more abatement; And la$tly, from the withdrawing of
the third the water ought to fall $o much more, which is wholly
impo$$ible: And yet it is mo$t certain, and be$ides the demon-
$tration that per$wades me to it, which I $hall explain in due
time, I can $et before your eyes $uch an experiment as is not to
be denied by any one, although ob$tinate: and I will make it
plainly $een and felt, that by taking away only four parts of the
five, which $hall have been taken away, the abatement proveth
double to the abatement en$uing upon the diverting fir$t of the
five onely; which thing being true, as mo$t certainly it is, it
will give us to under$tand how pernicious this diver$ion of five
Rivers is like to prove, if it $hall be put in execution.</P>
<P>By this little that I have hinted, and the much that I could
$ay, let your Highne$$e gather with what circum$pection this bu-
$ine$$e ought to be managed, and with how great skill he ought
to be furni$hed who would behave him$elf well in the$e difficult
affairs.</P>
<P>I have not at this time explained the demon$tration, nor have
I $o much as propounded the way to make the Experiment, that
I am able to make in confirmation of what I have $aid, that $o
by $ome one or others mi$-apprehending the Demon$tration,
and maiming the Experiment, the truth may not happen to $hine
with le$$e clarity than it doth, when all mi$ts of difficulty are re-
moved: and if $o be, no account $hould be made of the Rea$ons
by me alledged, and that men $hould $hut their eyes again$t the
Experiments that without co$t or charge may be made, I do de-
<foot>Llll 2 clare</foot>
<p n=>76</p>
clare and prote$t that there $hall follow very great dammages
to the Fields of the main Land, and extraordinary $ummes
$hall be expended to no purpo$e. The Lake undoubtedly will
become almo$t dry, and will prove impa$$ible for Navigation,
with a manife$t danger of corrupting the Air: And in the la$t
place there will unavoidably en$ue the choaking and $toppage of
the Ports of <I>Venice.</I></P>
<P>Upon the 20th. of <I>December,</I> 1641. I imparted this my $econd
Con$ideration to the mo$t Excellent <I>Signore Ba$adonna,</I> pre$en-
ting him with a Copy thereof among$t other Writings, which I
have thought good to in$ert, although they $eem not to belong
directly to our bu$ine$$e of the Lake.</P>
<head>The way to examine the MUD and SAND
that entereth and remaineth in the
LAKE of <I>VENICE.</I></head>
<head><I>To the mo$t Excellent</I></head>
<head>SIGNORE GIO. BASADONNA.</head>
<P>Two very con$iderable Objections have been made a-
gain$t my opinion concerning the Lake of <I>Venice:</I> One
was that, of which I have $poken at large in my fir$t
Con$ideration, namely, that the <I>Brents</I> having been taken out of
the Lake, cannot have been the occa$ion of the notable fall of
the Waters in the Lake, as I pretend, and con$equently, that
the turning <I>Brent</I> into the Lake would be no con$iderable reme-
dy, in regard that the water of <I>Brent,</I> and the great expan$ion
of the Lake over which the water of <I>Brent</I> is to diffu$e and
$pread being con$idered, it is found that the ri$e proveth in-
$en$ible.</P>
<P>The $econd Objection was, that the <I>Brent</I> is very muddy, and
therefore if it $hould fall muddy into the Lake, the Sand would
$ink and fill up the $ame.</P>
<P>Touching the fir$t Query, enough hath been $aid in my fir$t
Con$ideration, where I have plainly di$covered the deceipt of the
Argument, and $hewn its fallacy; It remaineth now to examine
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>77</p>
the $econd: to which in the fir$t place I $ay, that one of the fir$t
things that I propo$ed in this affair was, that I held it impo$$ible
to do any act, though never $o beneficial, that was not al$o ac-
companied by $ome inconvenience and mi$chief; and therefore
we are to con$ider well the profit, and the lo$$e and prejudice;
and they both being weighed, we $hall be able to choo$e the le$-
$er evil: Secondly, I admit it to be mo$t true, that <I>Brent</I> is at $ome
times muddy, but it is al$o true, that for the greater part of the
year it is not muddy. Thirdly, I do not $ee nor under$tand
what $trength this objection hath, being taken $o at large, and in
general; and methinks that it is not enough to $ay, that the
<I>Brent</I> runneth muddy, and to a$$ert that it depo$eth its Muddi-
ne$$e in the Lake, but we ought moreover to proceed to particu-
lars, and $hew how much this Mud is, and in what time this
choaking up of the Ports may be effected. For the Rea$ons are
but too apparent and particular, that conclude the ruine of the
Lake, and that in a very $hort time, (for mention is made of
dayes) the Waters diver$ion being made, and moreover we
have the circum$tance of an Experiment, the $tate of things be-
ing ob$erved to have grown wor$e $ince the $aid diver$ion. And
I have demon$trated, that in ca$e the Diver$ion of the <I>Sile</I> and
the other Rivers $hould be put in execution, the Lake would in a
few dayes become almo$t dry; and the Ports would be lo$t, with
other mi$chievous con$equences. But on the other $ide, al-
though that we did grant the choaking of them, we may very
probably $ay, that it will not happen, $ave onely in the $ucce$$ion
of many and many Centuries of years. Nor can I think it pru-
dent coun$el to take a re$olution and imbrace a De$igne now, to
obtain a benefit very uncertain, and more than that, which only
$hall concern tho$e who are to come very many Ages after us,
and thereby bring a certain inconvenience upon our $elves, and
upon our children that are now alive and pre$ent.</P>
<P>Let it be alledged therefore, (although I hold it fal$e) that by
the diver$ions of the Rivers the Lake may be kept in good con-
dition for $everal years to come.</P>
<P>But I $ay confidently, and hope to demon$trate it; That the
Diver$ions will bring the Lake, even in our dayes, to be almo$t
dry, and at lea$t will leave $o little water in it, that it $hall cea$e
to be Navigable, and the Ports $hall mo$t infallibly be choaked
up. I will therefore $ay upon experience, in an$wer to this Ob-
jection, that it is very nece$$ary fir$t well to di$cour$e, and ratio-
nally to particularize and a$certain the be$t that may be this
point of the quantity of this $inking Mud or Sand.</P>
<P>Now I fear I $hall make my $elf ridiculous to tho$e, who mea-
$uring the things of Nature with the $hallowne$$e of their brains
<foot>do</foot>
<p n=>78</p>
do think that it is ab$olutely impo$$ible to make this enquiry, and
will $ay unto me, <I>Quis men$us e$t pugillo aquas, &amp; terram palmo
ponderavit</I>? Yet neverthele$s I will propound a way whereby,
at lea$t in gro$s, one may find out the $ame.</P>
<P>Take a Ve$$el of Cylindrical Figure, holding two barrels of
water, or thereabouts; and then fill it with the water of <I>Brent,</I>
at its Mouth or Fall into the Lake; but in the Lake at the time
that the <I>Brent</I> runneth muddy, and after it hath begun to run
muddy for eight or ten hours, to give the mud time to go as far
as S. <I>Nicolo,</I> to i$$ue into the Sea; and at the $ame time take
another Ve$$el, like, and equal to the fir$t, and fill it with the wa-
ter of the Lake towards S. <I>Nicolo,</I> (but take notice that this ope-
ration ought to be made at the time when the waters go out,
and when the Sea is calm) and then, when the waters $hall have
$etled in the afore$aid Ve$$els, take out the clear water, and con-
$ider the quantity of Sand that remains behind, and let it be $et
down, or kept in mind: And I am ea$ily induced to think, that
that $hall be a greater quantity of Sand which $hall be left in the
fir$t Ve$$el, than that left in the $econd Ve$$el. Afterwards
when the <I>Brent</I> $hall come to be clear, let both the operations be
repeated, and ob$erve the quantity of Sand in the afore$aid Ve$-
$els; for if the Sand in the fir$t Ve$$el $hould be mo$t, it would
be a $ign, that in the revolution of a year the <I>Brent</I> would depo$e
Sand in the Lake: And in this manner one may calculate to a
$mall matter what proportion the Sand that entreth into the Lake,
hath to that which remains: And by that proportion one may
judge how expedient it $hall be for publick benefit. And if at
$everal times of the year you carefully repeat the $ame operati-
ons, or rather ob$ervations, you would come to a more exact
knowledge in this bu$ine$s: And it would be good to make the
$aid operations at tho$e times, when the Lake is di$turbed by
$trong high Winds, and made muddy by its own Mud, rai$ed by
the commotion of the Waters.</P>
<P>This notion would give us great light, if the $ame ob$ervations
$hould be made towards the Mouth of <I>Lio,</I> at $uch time as the
waters flow and ebb, in calm $ea$ons; for $o one $hould come to
know whether the waters of the Lake are more thick at the going
out, than at the entrance. I have propounded the foregoing
way of mea$uring Sands and Mud, to $hew that we are not $o
generally, and incon$iderately to pronounce any $entence, but
proceed to $tricter inquiries, and then deliberate what $hall be
mo$t expedient to be done. Others may propo$e more exqui-
$ite examinations, but this $hall $erve me for the pre$ent.</P>
<P>I will add onely, that if any one had greater curio$ity (it would
be profitable to have it) in inve$tigating more exactly the quan-
<foot>tity</foot>
<p n=>79</p>
tity of the Water that entereth into the Lake, by the means that
I have $hewen in the beginning of this Book: When he $hall
have found the proportion of the quantity of water to the quan-
tity of Sand or Mud, he $hall come to know how much Sand the
<I>Brent</I> $hall leave in the Lake in the $pace of a year. But to
perform the$e things, there are required per$ons of di$cretion, and
fidelity, and that are imployed by publick Order; for there
would thence re$ult eminent benefit and profit.</P>
<P><I>Here are wanting</I> LETTERS <I>from $everal per$ons.</I></P>
<head>To the Reverend Father, <I>France$co di</I></head>
<head>S. GIUSEPPE.</head>
<P>In execution of the command that you laid upon me in your
former Letters, by order from the mo$t Serene, my Lord,
<I>Prince Leopold</I>; that I $hould $peak my judgment concern-
ing the di$imboguement of the River called <I>Fiume morto,</I> whe-
ther it ought to be let into the Sea, or into <I>Serchio</I>; I $ay, that
I chanced 18. years $ince to be pre$ent, when the $aid Mouth was
opened into the Sea, and that of <I>Serchio</I> $topt; which work was
done to remedy the great Innundation that was made in all that
Country, and Plain of <I>Pi$a,</I> that lyeth between the River <I>Arno,</I>
and the Mountains of <I>S. Giuliano,</I> and the River <I>Serchio</I>; which
Plain continued long under water, in$omuch that not onely in the
Winter, but al$o for a great part of the Summer, tho$e fields
were overflowed; and when that the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I> was
effectually opened into the Sea, the place was pre$ently freed from
the waters. and drained, to the great $atisfaction of the Owners
of tho$e Grounds. And here I judge it worth your notice, that
for the generality of tho$e that po$$e$s e$tates in tho$e parts, they
de$ired that the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I> might $tand open to the
Sea, and tho$e who would have it open into <I>Serchio,</I> are per$ons
that have no other concernment there, $ave the hopes of gaining
by having the di$po$e of Commi$$ions, and the like, &amp;c,</P>
<P>But for the more plain under$tanding of that which is to be
$aid, it mu$t be known, That the re$olution of opening the $aid
Mouth into <I>Serchio,</I> was taken in the time of the Great Duke
<I>Ferdinando</I> the fir$t, upon the $ame motives that are at this time
again propo$ed, as your Letters tell me, Since that, it manife$t-
ly appearing, that <I>Fiume morto</I> had, and hath its Mouth open to
the Sea, the Plain hathbeen kept dry; and it being al$o true, that
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>80</p>
the fury of the South, and South-We$t-Winds carryed $uch
abundance of $and into the Mouth, or Out-let of <I>Fiume morto,</I>
that it wholly $topt it up: e$pecially when the waters on <I>Pi$a</I>
$ide were low and $hallow, And they think, that turning the
Lake of <I>Fiume morto</I> into <I>Serchio,</I> and the <I>Serchio</I> maintaining
continually its own Mouth with the force of its waters open to the
Sea, and con$equently al$o <I>Fiume morto,</I> they would have had the
Out-let clear and open; and in this manner they think, that the
Plain of <I>Pi$a</I> would have been freed from the waters. The bu-
$ine$s pa$$eth for current, at fir$t $ight; but experience proveth
the contrary, and Rea$on confirmeth the $ame: For the height
of the water of tho$e Plains, was regulated by the height of the
waters in the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I>; that is, The waters at the
Mouth being high, the waters al$o do ri$e in the fields; and when
the waters at the Mouth are low, the waters of the fields do like-
wi$e abate: Nor is it enough to $ay, That the Out-let or Vent
of <I>Fiume morto</I> is continual, but it mu$t be very low: Now if
<I>Fiume morto</I> did determine in <I>Serchio,</I> it is manife$t that it
would determine high; for <I>Serchio</I> terminating in the Sea, when
ever it more and more aboundeth with water, and ri$eth, it is ne-
ce$lary that al$o <I>Fiume morto</I> hath its level higher, and con$e-
quently $hall keep the waters in the Plains higher. Nay, it hath
happened $ometimes (and I $peak it upon my own $ight) that
<I>Fiume morto</I> hath rever$ed its cour$e upwards towards <I>Pi$a</I>;
which ca$e will ever happen, when$oever the <I>Pi$an</I> waters chance
to be lower than the level of tho$e of <I>Serchio</I>; for in that ca$e
the waters of <I>Serchio</I> return back upon the Plains thorow <I>Fiume
morto</I> in $uch $ort, that the Muddine$$es, and the <I>Serchio</I> have
been ob$erved to be carried by this return as farr as the Walls of
<I>Pi$a</I>; and then before $uch time as $o great waters can be a$-
$waged, which come in with great fury, and go out by little and
little, there do pa$s very many days, and moneths, nay $ome-
times one being never able to find the waters of <I>Serchio,</I>
when at the $hallowe$t, $o low as the Sea in level; (which is the
lowe$t place of the waters) it thence doth follow, that the wa-
ters of <I>Fiume morto</I> $hould never at any time of the year, $o long
as they determine in <I>Serchio,</I> be $o low, as they come to be when
the $ame <I>Fiume morto</I> determineth in the Sea. Tis true indeed,
that the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto,</I> opened into the Sea, is $ubject to
the inconvenience of being $topt up by the force of Winds: But
in this ca$e, it is nece$$ary to take $ome pains in opening it; which
may ea$ily be done, by cutting that Sand a little which $tayeth
in the Mouth, after that the Wind is laid; and it is enough if you
make a Trench little more than two Palms in breadth; for the
water once beginning to run into it, it will in a few hours carry
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>81</p>
that Sand away with it, and there will en$ue a deep and broad
Trench that will drain away all the water of the Plains in very lit-
tle time. And I have found by practice, that there having been
a great quantity of Sand driven back, by the fury of the South-
We$t-Wind, into the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto,</I> I having cau$ed the
little gutter to be made in the Morning, $omewhat before Noon,
a Mouth hath been opened of 40. Braces wide, and notably deep,
in$omuch that the water, which before had incommoded all the
Champian ran away in le$s than three dayes, and left the Coun-
try free and dry, to the admiration of all men. There was pre-
$ent upon the place, at this bu$ine$s, on the $ame day that I
opened the Mouth, the mo$t Serene great Duke, the mo$t Serene
Arch-Dutche$s Mother, all the Commi$$ioners of Sewers, with
many other Per$ons and Pea$ants of tho$e parts; and they all $aw
very well, that it was never po$$ible that a little Bark of eight
Oars, which was come from <I>Legorn</I> to wait upon the great
Duke, $hould ever be able to ma$ter the Current, and to make
up into <I>Fiume morto</I>; and his Highne$s, who came with an intent
to cau$e the $aid Mouth towards the Sea to be $topt; and that
into <I>Serchio</I> to be opened, changed his judgement, giving order
that it $hould be left open towards the Sea, as it was done. And
if at this day it $hall return into <I>Serchio,</I> I am very certain that it
will be nece$$ary to open it again into the Sea. And there was
al$o charge and order given to a per$on appointed for the pur-
po$e, that he $hould take care to open the $aid Mouth, as hath
been $aid upon occa$ion. And thus things have $ucceeded very
well unto this very time. But from the middle of <I>October,</I> until
this fir$t of <I>February,</I> there having continued high South, and
South-We$t-Winds, with frequent and abundant Rains; it is no
wonder that $ome innundation hath happened; but yet I will
affirm, that greater mi$chiefs would have followed, if the Mouth
had been opened into <I>Serchio.</I> This which I have hitherto $aid,
is very clear and intelligible to all $uch as have but competent in-
$ight, and indifferent skill in the$e affairs. But that which I am
now about to propo$e farther, will, I am very certain, be under-
$tood by your $elf, but it will $eem $trange and unlikely to many
others. The point is, that I $ay, That by rai$ing the level of
<I>Fiume morto,</I> one half Brace, onely at its Mouth, (it will peni-
penitrate into <I>Serchio</I> farther than it would into the Sea) it $hall
cau$e the waters to ri$e three, or perhaps more Braces upon the
fields towards <I>Pi$a,</I> and $till more by degrees as they $hall recede
farther from the Sea-$ide; and thus there will follow very great
Innundations, and con$iderable mi$chiefs. And to know that
this is true, you are to take notice of an accident, which I give
warning of in my di$cour$e of the Mea$ure of Running Waters:
<foot>Mmmm where</foot>
<p n=>82</p>
where al$o I give the rea$on thereof, ^{*} <I>Coroll.</I> 14. The ac-
cident is this, That there coming a Land-Flood, for example,
into <I>Arno,</I> which maketh it to ri$e above its ordinary Mouth
wthin <I>Pi$a,</I> or a little above or below the City $ix or $even Bra-
ces; this $ame height becometh alwaies le$$er and le$$er, the more
we approach towards the Sea-$ide; in$omuch, that near to the
Sea the $aid River $hall be rai$ed hardly half a Brace: Whence
it followeth of nece$$ary con$equence, that $hould I again be at
the Sea-$ide, and knowing nothing of what hapneth, $hould $ee
the River <I>Arno</I> rai$ed by the acce$$ion of a Land-flood, one third
of a Brace; I could certainly infer, that the $ame River was rai$ed
in <I>Pi$a</I> tho$e $ame $ix or $even Braces. And that which I $ay of
<I>Arno,</I> is true of all Rivers that fall into the Sea. Which thing
being true, it is nece$$ary to make great account of every $mall
ri$ing, that <I>Fiume morto</I> maketh towards the Sea-$ide by fal-
ling into <I>Serchio.</I> For although the ri$ing of <I>Fiume morto,</I> by
being to di$gorge its Waters into <I>Serchio,</I> towards the Sea, were
onely a quarter of a Brace; we might very well be $ure, that fart
from the Sea, about <I>Pi$a,</I> and upon tho$e fields the ri$e $hall be
much greater, and $hall become two or three Braces: And be-
cau$e the Countrey lyeth low, that $ame <*>i$e will cau$e a conti-
nual Innundation of the Plains, like as it did before; I cau$ed the
Mouth to be opened into the Sea. And therefore I conclude
that the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto,</I> ought by no means to be opened
into <I>Serchio</I>; but ought to be continued into the Sea, u$ing all
diligence to keep it open after the manner afore$aid, $o $oon as
ever the Wind $hall be laid. And if they $hall do otherwi$e, I
confidently affirm, that there will daily follow greater damages;
not onely in the Plains, but al$o in the whole$omne$s of the
Air; as hath been $een in times pa$t. And again, It ought with
all care to be procured, that no waters do by any means run or
fall from the Trench of <I>Libra,</I> into the Plain of <I>Pi$a,</I> for the$e
Waters being to di$charge into <I>Fiume morto,</I> they maintain it
much higher than is imagined, according to that which I have de-
mon$trated in my con$ideration upon the $tate of the Lake of
<I>Venice.</I> I have $aid but little, but I $peak to you, who under-
$tandeth much, and I $ubmit all to the mo$t refined judgment of
our mo$t Serene Prince <I>Leopold,</I> who$e hands I be$eech you in all
humility to ki$s in my name, and implore the continuance of his
Princely favour to me; and $o de$iring your prayers to God for
me, I take my leave.</P>

<P>D. BENEDETTO CASTELLI.</P>
<foot>The</foot>
<p n=>83</p>
<head>The an$wer to a Letter written by BAR-
TOLOTTI, touching the
difficultyes ob$erved.</head>
<head><I>The former part of the Letter is omitted, and the di$cour$e
beginneth at the fir$t Head.</I></head>
<P>And fir$t I $ay, Whereas I $uppo$e that the level of the <I>Ser-
chio</I> is higher than that of <I>Fiume morto</I>; this is mo$t true,
at $uch time as the waters of <I>Fiume morto</I> are di$charged in-
to the Sea; but I did never $ay that things could never be brought
to that pa$s, as that the level of <I>Fiume morto</I> $hould be higher than
<I>Serchio</I>: and $o I grant that it will follow, that the waters of
<I>Fiume morto</I> $hall go into <I>Serchio,</I> and its very po$$ible, that the
Drain of <I>Fiume morto</I> into <I>Serchio</I> may be continuate; and I far-
ther grant, that its po$$ible, that the <I>Serchio</I> doth never di$gorge
thorow <I>Fiume morto</I> towards <I>Pi$a</I>; Nay, I will yet farther grant
that it might have happened, that <I>Fiume morto</I> might have had
$uch a fall into <I>Serchio,</I> as would have $ufficed to have turned
Mills: But then I add withall, that the Plains of <I>Pi$a,</I> and the
City it $elf mu$t be a meer Lake.</P>
<P>2. <I>Signore Bartololti</I> $aith confidently, that when the Sea $wel-
leth by the South-We$t, or other Winds, the level of <I>Serchio</I> in
the place marked A in the Platt, di$tant about 200. Braces, ri$eth
very little: But that <I>Fiume morto</I> in D, and in E, many miles
more up into Land ri$eth very much, and that certain Fi$hermen
confirm this, and $hew him the $ignes of the ri$ing of the Water.
I grant it to be very true, and I have $een it with my own eyes:
But this cometh to pa$s, when the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I> is $topt
up by the Sea; as I $hall $hew by and by. And this ri$ing near
the Sea-$ide, is of no con$iderable prejudice to the fields. And
this is as much as I find to be true in the a$$ertion of <I>Signore Bar-
tolotti,</I> (without his confirming it by any other proof; as indeed
it needs none) That the level of <I>Fiume morto</I> ri$eth in E, and ma-
ny miles farther upwards it ri$eth much; nor did I ever affirm the
contrary.</P>
<P>3. Concerning the difficulty of opening the Mouth of <I>Fiume
morto</I> into the Sea, that which <I>Il Ca$tellano</I> $aith is mo$t certain;
namely, That at the entrance upon the opening of the Mouth, it
is nece$$ary to make a deep Trench: But I $ay, that at that time
it is difficult to open it, unle$s upon great occa$ions; for that the
<foot>Mmmm 2 difficulty</foot>
<p n=>84</p>
difficulty proceedeth from the waters of <I>Fiume morto</I> being low,
and the fields drained.</P>
<P>4. As to the particular of the Cau$es that you tell me men
pre$s $o much unto the mo$t <I>Serene Grand Duke,</I> and to the
Prince, I have not much to $ay, becau$e it is not my profe$$ion;
nor have I con$idered of the $ame: Yet I believe, that when the
Prince and his Highne$$e $ee the benefit of his People and Sub-
jects in one $cale of the Ballance, and the accomodation of
Hunt$men in the other, his Highne$$e will incline to the profit
of his $ubjects; $uch have I alwayes found his Clemency and
Noblene$$e of minde. But if I were to put in my vote upon
this bu$ine$$e, I would $ay, that the points of Spears, and the
mouths of Guns, the yelping of Dogs, the wilyne$$e of Hunt$-
men, who run thorow and narrowly $earch all tho$e Woods,
Thickets and Heathes, are the true de$troyers of Bucks and
Boares, and not a little Salt-water, which $etleth at la$t in $ome
low places, and $preadeth not very far. Yet neverthele$$e, I will
not enter upon any $uch point, but confine my $elf $olely to the
bu$ine$$e before me.</P>
<P>5. That Experiment of joyning together the water of <I>Fiume
morto,</I> and that of <I>Serchio</I> by a little trench to $ee what advan-
tage the Level E hath upon the Level I, doth not give me full
$atisfaction, taken $o particularly, for it may come to pa$$e, that
$ometimes E may be higher, and $ometimes A lower, and I do
not que$tion but that when <I>Serchio</I> is low, and <I>Fiume morto</I> full
of Water, the level of <I>Fiume morto</I> will be higher than that of
<I>Serchio.</I> But <I>Serchio</I> being full, and <I>Fiume morto</I> $cant of Wa-
ter, the contrary will follow, if the Mouth $hall be opened to
the Sea. And here it $hould $eem to me, that it ought to be
con$idered, that there is as much advantage from E to the Sea
through the little Trench opened anew into <I>Serchio,</I> as from E to
the Sea by the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto.</I> But the difficulty (which
is that we are to regard in our ca$e) is, that the cour$e of the
Waters thorow the Trench is three times longer than the cour$e
of the Mouth of <I>Fiums morto,</I> as appeareth by the Draught or
Plat which you $ent me, which I know to be very exactly drawn,
for that the $ituation of tho$e places are fre$h in my memory.
Here I mu$t give notice, that the waters of <I>Fiume morto</I> determi-
ning thorow the Trench in <I>Serchio</I> (the waters of which <I>Fiume
morto</I> are, for certain, never $o low as the Sea) their pendency or
declivity $hall, for two cau$es, be le$$e than the pendency of tho$e
waters through the Mouth towards the Sea, that is, becau$e of
the length of the line through the Trench, and becau$e of the
height of their entrance into <I>Serchio,</I> a thing which is of very
great import in di$charging the waters which come $uddenly, as
<foot>he</foot>
<p n=>85</p>
he $hall plainly $ee, who $hall have under$tood my Book of the
Mea$ure of Running Waters And this was the Rea$on why all
the Countrey did grow dry upon the opening of the Mouth into
the Sea. And here I propo$e to con$ideration that which the Pea-
$ants about <I>Pi$a</I> relate, namely, That the Water in the Fields
doth no con$iderable harm by continuing there five or $ix, yea, or
eight dayes. And therefore the work of the Countrey is to o-
pen the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto,</I> in $uch manner, that the Water
being come, they may have the Trench free and ready, when that
the Water cometh it may have a free drain, and may not $tay
there above eight or nine dayes, for then the overflowings be-
come hurtful. It is to be de$ired al$o, that if any Propo$ition is
produced touching the$e affairs, it might be propounded the mo$t
di$tinctly that may be po$$ible, and not con$i$t in generals, e$pe-
cially when the Di$pute is of the ri$ings, of velocity, of tardity,
of much and little water; things that are all to be $pecified by
mea$ures.</P>
<P>6. Your Letter $aith, in the next place, that <I>Signore Barto-
lotti</I> confe$$eth, that if the Mouth of the <I>Fiume morto</I> might al-
wayes be kept open, it would be better to let it continue as it is:
the which, that I may not yield to him in courte$ie, I confe$$e,
for the keeping it $topt on all $ides would be a thing mo$t per-
nicious. But admitting of his confe$$ion I again reply, that <I>Fi-
ume morto</I> ought not to be let into <I>Serchio,</I> but immediately in-
to the Sea; becau$e although $ometimes the Mouth to Sea-
wards be $topt up, yet for all that, the rai$ing of the Bank above
the Plains (which is all the bu$ine$$e of importance) $hall be ever
le$$er, if we make u$e of the Mouth leading to the Sea, than u-
$ing that of <I>Serchio.</I></P>
<P>7. I will not omit to mention a kinde of $cruple that I have
concerning the po$ition of <I>Sign. Bartolotti,</I> that is, where he $aith
that the two Mouths A and D are equal to the like Mouths into
the Sea; Now it $eems to me, that the Mouth A of <I>Fiume morto</I>
into <I>Serchio</I> is ab$olutely within <I>Serchio,</I> nor can it be made low-
er, and is regulated by the height of <I>Serchio</I>: But the Mouth
of <I>Fiume morto</I> terminates, and ought to be under$tood to ter-
minate in the Sea it $elf, the lowe$t place. And this I believe
was very well peroeived by <I>Sig. Bartolotti,</I> but I cannot tell why
he pa$t it over without declaring it: and we $ee not that the
Mouth D falleth far from the Sea, which Mouth ought to be let
into the Sea it $elf, and $o the advantage of the <I>M</I>outh into the
Sea more clearly appeareth.</P>
<P>8. That which <I>Sig. Bartolotti</I> addeth, that when it is high
Waters, at $uch time as the Waters are out, and when Winds
choak up <I>Fiume morto,</I> they not only retard it, but return the
<foot>cour$e</foot>
<p n=>86</p>
cour$e of the Waters upwards very lea$urely, per$wadeth me
more readily to believe that <I>Sig. Bartolotti</I> knoweth very well,
that the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I> let into <I>Serchio</I> is hurtful: for
by this he acknowledgeth that the Mouth towards the Sea doth
in $uch $ort drain the Countrey of the Waters, as that they be-
come very low; and therefore upon every little <I>impetus</I> the wa-
ters turn their cour$e: And from the motions, being exceeding
$low, is inferred, that the abundance of Sea-water that com-
eth into <I>Fiume morto,</I> is $o much as is believed, and as <I>Sig. Bat-
tolotti</I> affirmeth.</P>
<P>9. After that <I>Sig. Bartolotti</I> hath $aid what he promi$eth a-
bove, namely, that when the Windes blowing $trongly do $top
up <I>Fiume morto,</I> and not onely retard but turn the cour$e up-
wards, the time being Rainy, and the Mouth of <I>Fiume morto</I> $hut
up, the Waves of the Sea pa$$e over the Bank of <I>Fiume morto</I>; at
that time, $aith <I>Signore Bartolotti,</I> the Champain $hall know the
benefit of <I>Fiume morto</I> di$charged into <I>Serchio,</I> and the mouth A
$hall $tand alwayes open; and <I>Fiume morto</I> may alwayes con-
$tantly run out, as al$o the Rains and Rain-waters, although the
hurtful Tempe$t $hould la$t many dayes, &amp;c. And I reply, that
all the Art con$i$ts in this; for the benefit of tho$e Fields doth
not depend on, or con$i$t in $aying, that <I>Fiume morto</I> is alwayes
open, and <I>Fiume morto</I> draineth continually; But all the bu$i-
ne$$e of profit lyeth and con$i$teth in maintaining the Waters
low in tho$e Plaines, and tho$e Ditches, which $hall never be ef-
fected whil$t the World $tands, if you let <I>Fiume morto</I> into <I>Ser-
chio</I>; but yet it may, by opening the mouth into the Sea: and
$o much rea$on and nature proveth, and (which importeth) Ex-
perience confirmeth.</P>
<P>10. In the tenth place I come to con$ider the an$wer that
was made to another Propo$ition in the Letter which I writ to
Father <I>France$co,</I> which prudently of it $elf alone might $erve
to clear this whole bu$ine$$e. I $aid in my Letter, That great
account is to be made of every $mall ri$ing and ebbing of the
Waters neer to the Sea in <I>Fiume morto,</I> for that the$e ri$ings and
fallings, although that they be $mall neer to the Sea-$ide, yet ne-
verthele$$e, they operate and are accompanied by notable ri$ings
and fallings within Land, and far from the Sea-$ide, and I have
declared by an example of <I>Arno,</I> in which a Land-flood falling,
that made it increa$e above its ordinary height within <I>Pi$a</I> $ix or
$even Braces, that this height of the $ame Flood becometh $till
le$$er, the neerer we approach to the Sea-coa$ts. Nor $hall the
$aid River be rai$ed hardly half a Brace; whereupon it nece$$-
rily followeth, that if I $hould return to the Sea-$ide, and not
knowing any think of that which happeneth at <I>Pi$a,</I> and $eeing
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>87</p>
the River <I>Arno</I> rai$ed by a Land-flood half a Brace, I might con-
fidently affirm the $aid River to be rai$ed in <I>Pi$a</I> tho$e $ix or $e-
ven Braces, &amp;c. From $uch like accidents I conclude in the $ame
Letter, that it is nece$$ary to make great account of every little
ri$e that <I>Fiume morto</I> $hall make towards the Sea. Now cometh
<I>Bartolotti</I> (and perhaps becau$e I knew not how to expre$s my
$elf better, under$tandeth not my Propo$ition) and $peaketh that
which indeed is true, but yet be$ides our ca$e: Nor have I ever
$aid the contrary; and withall doth not apply it to his purpo$e.
Nay I $ay, that if he had well applyed it, this alone had been a-
ble to have made him change his opinion. And becau$e he $aith,
that I $aid, that it is true, when the abatement proceedeth from
$ome cau$e above, as namely by Rain, or opening of Lakes;
But when the cau$e is from below, that is, by $ome $top, as for
in$tance $ome Fi$hers Wears or Locks, or $ome impediment re-
mote from the Sea, although at the Level it $hall ri$e $ome Braces
where the impediment is, yet that ri$ing $hall go upwards; and
here he fini$heth his Di$cour$e, and concludeth not any thing
more. To which I $ay fir$t, that I have al$o $aid the $ame in the
Propo$ition, namely, that a Flood coming (which maketh <I>Arno</I>
to ri$e in <I>Pi$a</I> $ix or $even Braces (which I take to be a $uperiour
cau$e whether it be Rain or the opening of Lakes, as be$t plea-
$eth <I>Bartolotti</I>) in $uch a ca$e I $ay, and in no other (for towards
the Sea-coa$ts it $hall not cau$e a ri$ing of full half a Brace; and
therefore $eeing <I>Arno</I> at the Sea-$ide to be rai$ed by a Flood, whe-
ther of Rain, or of opening of Lakes half a Brace) it may be
inferred, that at <I>Pi$a</I> it $hall be rai$ed tho$e $ix or $even Braces;
which variety, well con$idered, explaineth all this affair in favour
of my opinion: For the ri$ing that is made by the impediment
placed below, of Fi$hing Weares and Locks, operateth at the be-
ginning, rai$ing the Waters that are neer to the impediment;
and afterwards le$s and le$s, as we retire upwards from the im-
pediment: provided yet that we $peak not of a Flood that com-
meth by acce$$ion, but onely of the ordinary Water impeded.
But there being a new acce$$ion, as in our ca$e, then the Water
of the Flood, I $ay, $hall make a greater ri$ing in the parts $uperi-
our, far from the impediment; and the$e impediments $hall
come to be tho$e that $hall overflow the Plains, as happened
eighteen or nineteen years ago, before the opening of <I>Fiume
morto</I> into the Sea, The $ame will certainly follow, if <I>Fiume
morto</I> be let into <I>Serchio.</I> Here I could alledge a very pretty
ca$e that befell me in <I>la ^{*} Campagna di Roma,</I> neer to the Sea-
<marg>* The Countrey
or Province lying
round the City,
heretofore called
<I>Lati u<*>s.</I></marg>
$ide. where I drained a Bog or Fen, of the nature of the Wa-
ters of <I>Pi$a,</I> and I $ucceeded in the enterprize, the Waters in their
$ite towards the Sea abating only three Palmes, and yet in the
<foot>Fen</foot>
<p n=>88</p>
Fen they fell more than fifteen Palmes. But the bu$ine$$e
would be long, and not $o ea$ily to be declared, and I am cer-
tain that <I>Sig. Bartolotti</I> having con$idered this, would alter his
judgment, and withall would know that remitting that impedi-
ment anew, which I had left for le$$e than three Palmes towards
the Sea, the Waters in the Fen would return with the fir$t Floods
and Raines to the $ame height as before, as likewi$e <I>Fiume morto</I>
will do if it $hall be let again into <I>Serchio.</I></P>
<P>Here I intreat your Honour to do me the favour to importune
<I>P. France$co</I> in my behalf, that he would be plea$ed to deelare
my meaning in the afore$aid Letter to <I>Sig. Bartolotti,</I> for I hope
that if he will under$tand this point, he will be no longer $o te-
nacious in his opinion.</P>
<P>Next that the$e Lords in the Commi$$ion of Sewers, with the
Right Honourable the Marque$$e of S. <I>Angelo,</I> and your Honour
do approve of my judgment, doth very much rejoyce me; but
becau$e that I know that they do it not in de$ign to complement
me, but onely to $erve his Highne$s our Grand Duke, I freely
profe$s that I will pretend no farther obligations from them there-
in, than I account my $elf to owe to tho$e who$e opinions are
contrary to mine, for that I know that they have the $ame end.
The definitive $entence of this whole bu$ine$s is, that they give
the$e Plains, the$e Draines, and the$e Waters farre fetcht ap-
pellations.</P>
<P>11. As to the quantity of the Water that <I>Fiume morto</I> di$-
chargeth into the Sea, there are very great di$putes about it, and
I have been pre$ent at $ome of them. But let your Honour be-
lieve me, that as this is not continual, but only during a few
dayes, $o it will never be of any great prejudice to the$e Fields;
and if your Lord$hip would be a$certained thereof, you may
plea$e to go to <I>Fiume morto</I> at about a mile's di$tance from the
Sea, in the time of the$e $trong Windes, and ob$erve the cur-
rent from thence upwards, for you $hall finde it extream $low,
and con$equently will know that the quantity of the Water that
is repuls'd is very $mall. And this $eems to be contradicted by the
rule of Ri$ings proceeding from cau$es below, which occa$ion no
con$iderable alteration far from the Sea.</P>
<P>I am nece$$itated to go to morrow out of <I>Rome</I> with his Emi-
nence Cardinal <I>Gaetano</I> about certain affairs touching Waters,
therefore I $hall not farther inlarge, but for a clo$e to this tedious
Di$cour$e, I conclude in few words, that <I>Fiume morto</I> is by no
means to be let into <I>Serchio,</I> nor are there any means intermedi-
ate cour$es to be taken, for they will alwayes be prejudicial; but
<I>Fiume morto</I> is to be di$charged immediately into the Sea. When
it is $topt up by the fury of the Sea waves, I affirm that it is a
<foot>$ign</foot>
<p n=>89</p>
$ign that there is no need of opening it; and if there be any oc-
ca$ion to open it, it is ea$ily done. As for the re$t your Lord$hip
may plea$e to keep account of all the particulars that occur, for
the memory of things pa$t is our Tutre$$e in tho$e that are to
come. If occa$ion $hall offer, I intreat you to bow humbly in
my name to His Highne$s the Grand Duke, and the mo$t Serene
Prince <I>Leopold</I>; and to attend the $ervice of Their Highne$$es, for
you $erve I rinces of extraordinary merit; And to whom I my

ledge of that $o important Propo$ition, by me demon$trated and
explained in my Treati$e of the <I>Men$uration</I> of <I>Running Wa-
ters,</I> namely, That the $ame water of a River doth continually
change Mea$ures, according as it altereth and changeth the ve-
locity of its cour$e; $o that the mea$ure of the thickne$$e of a
River in one Site, to the mea$ure of the $ame River in another
Site, hath the $ame proportion reciprocally that the velocity in
this $ite hath to the velocity in the fir$t $ite. And this is a Truth
$o con$tant and unchangeable, that it altereth not in the lea$t
point on any occurrences of the Waters that change: and
being well under$tood, it openeth the way to the knowledge of
$undry adverti$ements in the$e matters, which are all re$olved by
this $ole Principle; and from it are derived very con$iderable be-
nefits; and without the$e it is impo$$ible to do any thing with
ab$olute perfection</P>

CONSIDERATION
Upon the
DRAINING
OF THE
Pontine Fenns.
BY</head>
<head>D. BENEDETTO CASTELLI, Abbot
of S. BENEDETTO ALOISIO, and Profe$$or
of the <I>Mathematicks</I> to P. <I>Urban</I> VIII. in the
Univer$ity of <I>ROME.</I></head>
<head><I>CONSIDERATION</I> III.</head>
<P>Among$t the enterprizes by me e$teemed, if not ab-
$olutely impo$$ible, , at lea$t exceeding difficult,
one was that famous one of Draining the <I>Pontine
Fenns</I>; and therefore I was thorowly re$olved
never to apply my minde thereunto, although
by my Patrons I $hould be commanded to the
$ame: accounting that it was an occa$ion rather of lo$ing repu-
tation by the mi$carriage of the attempt, than of gaining fame by
reducing things to a better pa$s then they now are at. Yet never-
thele$s, having of late years ob$erved the place, and $ailed through
tho$e Chanels, and tho$e Waters; after I had made $ome reflection
thereupon, I thought that the enterprize was not $o difficult as
I had at fir$t conceited it to be; and I am the more confirmed in
this opinion, upon the ind<*>ement of that which I have written
<foot>Nnnn 2 Geo-</foot>
<p n=>92</p>
Geometrically in my Treati$e of the Men$uration of Running
Waters; $o that talking with $everal per$ons, I adventured to
affirm, in di$coures, that this improvement might po$$ibly be
brought into a good e$tate.</P>
<P>Now I have re$olved to $et down my thoughts in writing, and
to honour this my Paper with the Noble Name of your Lord$hip,
to render it the more credible and con$picuous at the fir$t view,
if it $hould chance that the Subject I treat of, were not of $uch
moment, as that it did de$erve to be valued for any other rea$on.
Pardon me, Sir, if I have been too bold, and continue me in the
number of your Servants.</P>
<P>The enterprize of Draining a great part of the Territories of
the <I>Pontine Fenns,</I> hath been undertaken both in the time of
the antient <I>Romans,</I> and la$t of all, in our days; yea in the late
times by <I>Sixtus</I> V. I do not doubt in the lea$t, but that it will
be po$$ible yet to reduce things to a very good pa$s; and if I be not
mi$taken, with a very $mall charge in compari$on of the profit that
would be received from tho$e rich Grounds. This improvement
was of great expence in the time of <I>Sixtus Quintus,</I> but by rea-
$on the thing was not rightly under$tood, there were made many
Drains; a great part of which were unprofitable and vain: and
among$t $o many operations, there hapned $ome to be made that
$ucceeded, as was de$ired; but not being under$tood, they were
held in no account; and thus the bu$ine$s being neglected, the
waters are returned into the $ame $tate as they were at fir$t, be-
fore the improvement. Here I have by familiar di$cour$es
with my friends, explained this enterprize undertaken by <I>Six-
tus</I> V. and haply al$o by $ome more antient, with the example of
the Fable of <I>Orilo,</I> in <I>Ario$to.</I> This Mon$ter was made up with
$uch enchantment, that men fought with him alwayes in vain;
for though in the Combate he were cut in pieces, tho$e divided
Members pre$ently re-united, and returned to the fight more
fierce then ever. But the <I>Paladine A$tolfo</I> coming to undertake
him, after a long di$pute, at the end he cut his head $heer off
from the $houlders at one blow; and nimbly alighting from his
Hor$e, took the Mon$trous head, and mounting again, as he rid
away he fell to $have the Pole of that Mon$ter, and $o he lo$t
the Lock of Hair, in which alone the enchantment lay; and then
the horrible Head in an in$tant manife$ted $igns of death, and the
trunk which ran, $eeking to reunite to it anew, gave the la$t ga$p,
and in this manner the enchantment ended. The Book of Fate
$erved admirably to the <I>Paladine,</I> whereby he came to under-
$tand that Charm; for by $having his whole head, the enchanted
hairs came to be cut off among$t the re$t: In the $ame manner, I
$ay, that it hath $ometimes happened in Draining tho$e Fields;
<foot>for</foot>
<p n=>93</p>
for that among$t $o many tryals as have been made, that al$o
was light upon, on which the improvement and remedy to the
di$order did depend. And to us my fore-named Treati$e $hall
$erve for a Rule, which being well under$tood, $hall make us to
know wherein con$i$teth, and whereon dependeth this mi$carri-
age, and con$equently it will be ea$ie to apply thereunto a $ea$o-
nable remedy.</P>
<P>And fir$t I $ay, That there is no doubt but that the waters
continue $o high on tho$e Plains becau$e they are $o high in the
principal River, which ought to receive them, and carry them
into the Sea. Now the Cau$es of the height of the River, may
in my judgement be reduced to one alone; which is that by me
$o often mentioned for the mo$t Potent one, and declared in my
afore-named Tractate; to wit, The tardity of the motion of the
waters, which doth alwayes infallibly, and preci$ely cau$e the
$elf $ame Running Water to change the mea$ure of its thickne$s
at $uch a rate, that the more it encrea$eth in velocity, the more
it decrea$eth in mea$ure; and the more it decrea$eth in velocity,
the more it encrea$eth in mea$ure: As for example; If a River
run in $uch a place with the velocity of moving a mile in the
$pace of an hour, and afterwards the $ame River in another place
doth encrea$e in velocity, $o as to make three miles an hour;
that $ame River $hall dimini$h in thickne$s two thirds: And on
the contrary, If it $hall dimini$h in velocity $o, as that it runneth
but half a mile in the $ame time, it $hall encrea$e the double in
thickne$s and mea$ure. And in a word, look what proportion
the velocity in the fir$t place, hath to the velocity in the $econd,
and $uch hath reciprocally the mea$ure of the thickne$s in the
$econd place, to the mea$ure in the fir$t; as I have clearly demon-
$trated in my Treati$e: Which I repeat $o frequently, that I
fear the Profe$$ors of Polite Learning will charge me with Tua-
tologie, and vain Repetition. But I am $o de$irous in this mo$t
important point to be well under$tood, becau$e it will then be
ea$ie to comprehend all the re$t; and without this it is impo$$ible
(I will not $ay difficult, but ab$olutely impo$$ible) to under$tand,
or ever to effect any thing to purpo$e. And the better to ex-
plain the example, let it be $uppo$ed,
<fig>
That the water of a River A D,
runneth high at the level of A F,
with $uch a certain velocity; and let
it, by the $ame water, be velocitated
three times more; I $ay, that it will
abate 1/3, and $hall $tand at the level
in B E; and if it $hall more veloci-
tate, it will abate the more at the Sea; But if it $hould retard
<foot>more</foot>
<p n=>94</p>
more than it did at the level AF, it would ri$e yet more above
the $aid level A F; although that the $elf $ame quantity of water
runneth all the while. By the above-named $olid Principle I
re$olve extravagant Problems in my Treati$e, and a$$ign the Rea-
$ons of admirable effects of Running Waters: But as for what
concerneth our purpo$e of the <I>Pontine Fenns,</I> we have the Cau-
$es very plain and clear; for which, by the trampling of Cattle
which pa$s thorow the <I>Draining River,</I> the waters abate $o nota-
bly, that it is as it were a miracle for tho$e Reeds, Flags, and
Weeds that $pring up, encrea$e, and $pread all over the River,
$top and impede that velocity of the waters which they would
have by means of their declivity. But that pa$$age of tho$e Bea$ts,
treading down tho$e Weeds unto the bottom of the River, in $uch
$ort, as that they no longer hinder the Current of the Water;
and the $ame Waters increa$ing in their cour$e, they do dimi-
ni$h in mea$ure and height; and by this meanes the Ditches of the
Plains empty into the $ame $ucce$sfully, and leave them free
from Waters, and Drained. But the$e Weeds in a $hort
time $prouting up anew, and rai$ing their $talkes thorow the
body of the Waters, they reduce things to the $ame evil
$tate, as before, retarding the velocity of the Water, ma-
king it to increa$e in height, and perhaps do occa$ion grea-
ter mi$chiefs; $eeing that tho$e many knots which each plant
$hoots forth, begets a greater multitude of Stalks, which much
more incumbering the Water of the River, are a greater impe-
diment unto its velocity, and con$equently make the height
of the waters to encrea$e $o much the more, and do more mi$chief
than before.</P>
<P>Another head to which the$e harms may be reduced, but pro-
ceeding from the $ame Root, which hath a great part in this
di$order, is the impediment of tho$e Wears in the River which
are made by heightning the bed of the $ame, for placing of fi$h-
ing-nets; of which <I>Pi$caries</I> I reckoned above ten, when I made
a voyage thorow tho$e waters to <I>Sandolo.</I> And the$e Fi$hing-
Wears are $uch impediments, that $ome one of them makes the
water of the River in the upper part to ri$e half a Palm, and
$ometimes a whole Palm, and more; $o that when they are all
gathered together, the$e impediments amount to more than $even,
or po$$ibly than eight Palms.</P>
<P>There concurreth for a third mo$t Potent Cau$e of the waters
continuing high in the evacuating, or Draining Chanel, and con-
$equently on the Plains; The great abundance of water that i$$u-
eth from <I>Fiume Si$to,</I> the waters of which do not keep within its
Banks when they are abundant; but encrea$ing above its Chanel,
they unite with tho$e of the Evacuator, and di$per$ing thorow
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>95</p>
the Fens are rai$ed with great prejudice, and much grea-
ter than is conceived, according to what hath been demon-
$trated in the Second Con$ideration upon the <I>Lake of Venice.</I>
Nor is it to any purpo$e to $ay, that if we $hould mea$ure
all the Waters that disimbogue from <I>Fiume Si$to,</I> and gather
them into one $umme, we $hould not finde them to be $uch,
as that they $hall be able to make the Waters of the Fens
to increa$e, by rea$on of the great expan$ion of them, over
which that body of water is to di$tend: for to this in$tance we
an$wer wich that which we have given notice of in the Fir$t Con-
$ideration touching the <I>Lake of Venice,</I> treating of the abate-
ment that is cau$ed by the <I>Brent</I> let into the Lake. And more-
over, if I $hall adde thereto that which I write in the Second
Con$ideration, it will be very apparent how greatly harmfull
and prejudicial the$e excurfions of Waters from <I>Fiume Si$to</I>
may be, which are not kept under, and confined within the
River: Therefore, proceeding to the provi$ions, and ope-
rations that are to be accounted Principall, I reduce them to
three Heads.</P>
<P>In the fir$t place it is nece$$ary to throw down tho$e Weares,
and to take the Pi$ciaries quite away, ob$erving a Maxime, in
my judgment, infallible, that Fi$hing and Sowing are two things
that can never con$i$t together; Fi$hing being on the Water, and
Sowing on land.</P>
<P>Secondly, it will be nece$$ary to cut under Water in the bot-
tome of the River tho$e Weeds and Plants that grow and in-
crea$e in the River, and leave them to be carried into the Sea by
the Stream; for by this means the$e Reeds $hall not $pring up
and di$tend along the bottome of the River, by means of the
Bea$ts treading upon them; And the $ame ought to be done
often, and with care, and mu$t not be delaied till the mi$-
chief increa$e, and the Champain Grounds be drowned, but
one ought to order matters $o, as that they may not drown.
And I will affirm, that otherwi$e this principal point would be-
come a mo$t con$iderable inconvenience.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is nece$$ary to make good the Banks of <I>Fiume Si$to</I>
on the left hand, and to procure that tho$e Waters may run in
the Chanel, and not break forth. And it is to be noted, that
it is not enough to do one or two of tho$e things, but we are to
put them all in execution; for omitting any thing, the whole
machine will be out of tune, and $poiled. But proceeding with
due care, you $hall not only Drain the <I>Pontine Fens,</I> but by
means of this la$t particular the Current of <I>Fiums Sisto</I> $hall
$cowr its own Chanel of its $elf, even to the carrying part of it
away: and haply with this abundance of water that it $hall
<foot>bear</foot>
<p n=>96</p>
bear, the Mouth <I>della Torre</I> may be opened, and kept open
into the Sea. And it would, la$t of all, be of admirable bene-
fit to clean$e <I>Fiume Sisto</I> from many Trees and Bu$hes where-
with it is overgrown.</P>
<P>And with this I conclude, that the Improvement or Drain
po$$ible to be made con$i$teth in the$e three particulars. Fir$t,
in taking away the Fi$hing Weares, leaving the Cour$e
of the Waters free. Secondly, in keeping the Principal
Rivers clear from Weeds and Plants. Thirdly, in keeping
the water of <I>Fiume Sisto</I> in its own Chanel. All which are
things that may be done with very little charge, and to the
manife$t benefit of the whole Country, and to the rendering
the Air whol$omer in all tho$e Places adjoyning to the <I>Pon-
tine Fens.</I></P>

CONSIDERATION
Upon the
DRAINING
Of the Territories of
Bologna, Ferrara,
AND
Romagna.</head>
<head>BY
D. BENEDETTO CASTELLI, Abbot
of S. BENEDETTO ALOISIO, <I>Mathematician</I>
to P. <I>Vrban</I> VIII. and Profe$$or in the
Univer$ity of <I>ROME.</I></head>
<P>The weghty bu$ine$$e of the Draining of
the Territories of <I>Bologna, Ferrara,</I>
and <I>Romagna</I> having been punctually
handled and declared in writing from
the excellent memory of the Right Ho-
nourable and Noble <I>Mon$ignore Cor$ini,</I>
who was heretofore Deputed Commi$-
$ary General, and Vi$itor of tho$e Wa-
ters; I am not able to make $uch ano-
ther Di$cour$e upon the $ame Subject, but will only $ay $ome-
what for farther confirmation of that which I have $aid in this
Book upon the <I>Lake of Venice,</I> upon the <I>Pontine Fens,</I> and up-
on the Draining of tho$e Plains of <I>Pi$a,</I> lying between the Ri-
vers <I>Arno</I> and <I>Serchio</I>; whereby it is manife$t, that in all the
<foot>Oooo afore-</foot>
<p n=>98</p>
aforementioned Ca$es, and in the pre$ent one that we are in hand
with, there have, in times pa$t, very gro$$e Errours been com-
mitted, through the not having ever well under$tood the true
mea$ure of Running waters; and here it is to be noted, that the
bu$ine$$e is, that in <I>Venice,</I> the diver$ion of the waters of the
Lake, by diverting the <I>Brent</I> was debated, and in part executed,
without con$ideration had how great abatement of water might
follow in the Lake, if the <I>Brent</I> were diverted, as I have $hewn
in the fir$t Con$ideration upon this particular, from which act
there hath in$ued very bad con$equences, not only the difficulty
of Navigation, but it hath infected the whol$omne$$e of the Air,
and cau$ed the $toppage of the Ports of <I>Venice.</I> And on the
contrary, the $ame inadvertency of not con$idering what ri$ing of
the Water the <I>Reno,</I> and other Rivers being opened into the Val-
leys of <I>Bologna</I> and <I>Ferrara,</I> might cau$e in the $aid Valleys, is
the certain cau$e that $o many rich and fertile Fields are drown-
ed under water, converting the happy habitations and dwellings
of men into mi$erable receptacles for Fi$hes: Things which
doubtle$$e would never have happened, if tho$e Rivers had been
kept at their height, and <I>Reno</I> had been turn'd into <I>Main-Po,</I>
and the other Rivers into that of <I>Argenta,</I> and of <I>Volano.</I> Now
there having $ufficient been $poken by the above-named <I>Mon$ig.
Cor$ini</I> in his Relation, I will only adde one conceit of my own,
which after the Rivers $hould be regulated, as hath been $aid, I
verily believe would be of extraordinary profit, I much doubt in-
deed that I $hall finde it a hard matter to per$wade men to be of
my mind, but yet neverthele$s I will not que$tion, but that tho$e,
at lea$t, who $hall have under$tood what I have $aid and demon-
$trated concerning the manners and proportions, according to
which the abatements and ri$ings of Running waters proceed,
that are made by the Diver$ions and Introductions of Waters,
will apprehend that my conjecture is grounded upon Rea$on.
And although I de$cend not to the exactne$$e of particulars, I
will open the way to others, who having ob$erved the requi$ite
Rules of con$idering the quantity of the waters that are intro-
duced, or that happen to be diverted, $hall be able with punctu-
ality to examine the whole bu$ine$$e, and then re$olve on that
which $hall be expedient to be done.</P>
<P>Reflecting therefore upon the fir$t Propo$ition, that the
Ri$ings of a Running Water made by the acce$$ion of new water
into the River, are to one another, as the Square-Roots of the
quantity of the water that runneth; and con$equently, that the
$ame cometh to pa$s in the Diver$ions: In$omuch, that a River
running in height one $uch a certain mea$ure, to make it encrea$e
double in height, the water is to be encrea$ed to three times as
<foot>much</foot>
<p n=>99</p>
much as it ran before; $o that when the water $hall be quadru-
ple, the height $hall be double; and if the water were centuple,
the height would be decuple onely, and $o from one quantity
to another: And on the contrary, in the Diver$ions; If of the
100. parts of water that run thorow a River, there $hall be di-
verted 19/160, the height of the River dimini$heth onely 1/10, and con-
tinuing to divert 17/100, the height of the River abateth likewi$e 1/10,
and $o proceeding to divert 15/100 and then 13/100, and then 11/100, and
then 9/100, and then 7/100, and then 5/100, and then 3/106, alwaies by
each of the$e diver$ions, the height of the Running Water di-
mini$heth the tenth part: although that the diver$ions be $o une.
qual. Reflecting I $ay upon this infallible Truth, I have had a
conceit, that though the <I>Reno</I> and other Rivers were diverted
from the Valleyes, and there was onely left the <I>Chanel of Navi-
gation,</I> which was onely the 1/20 part of the whole water that fal-
leth into the Valleys; yet neverthele$s, the water in tho$e $ame
Valleyes would retain a tenth part of that height that became
conjoyned by the concour$e of all the Rivers: And therefore I
$hould think that it were the be$t re$olution to maintain the <I>Gha-
nel of Navigation</I> (if it were po$$ible) continuate unto the P<I>o</I> of
<I>Ferrara,</I> and from thence to carry it into the P<I>o</I> of <I>Volano</I>; for
be$ides that it would be of very great ea$e in the Navigation of
<I>Bologna,</I> and <I>Ferrara,</I> the $aid water would render the P<I>o</I> o$
<I>Volano</I> navigable as far as to the very Walls of <I>Ferrara,</I> and con-
$equently the Navigation would be continuate from <I>Bologna</I> to
the Sea-$ide.</P>
<P>But to manage this enterprize well, it is nece$$ary to mea$ure
the quantity of the Water that the Rivers di$charge into the Val-
leys, and that which the <I>Chanel of Navigation</I> carryeth, in man-
ner as I have demon$trated at the beginning of this Book; for this
once known, we $hall al$o come to know, how profitable this di-
ver$ion of the <I>Chanel of Navigation</I> from the Valleys is like to
prove; which yet would $till be unprofitable, if $o be that all
the Rivers that di$charge their waters into the Valleys, $hould
not $ir$t be Drained, according to what hath been above ad-
verti$ed.</P>
<P>Abbot CASTELLI, <I>in the pre$ent con$ideration referring
himfelf to the Relation of</I> Mon$ig. Cor$ini, <I>grounded upon the Ob-
$ervations and Precepts of the $aid Abbot; as is $een in the pre-
$ent Di$cour$e. I thought it convenient for the compleating of the
Work of our Aulhour, upon the$e $ubjects, to in$ert it in this
place.</I></P>

the moderne of the mouth of <I>Ma$i,</I> $o that at pre$ent the Com-
merce between <I>Bologna</I> and <I>Ferrara</I> is lo$t, nor can it ever be
in any durable way renewed, whil$t that this exceeds its due
bounds, and what ever moneys $hall be imployed about the $ame
$hall be without any equivalent benefit, and to the manife$t
<marg>* The Popes

and notable prejudice of the ^{*} Apo$tolick Chamber.</P>
<P>Thence pa$$ing into the Valley of <I>Marzara,</I> it $welleth high-
er, not only by the ri$ing of the water, but by the rai$ing of the
bottome, by rea$on of the matter $unk thither after Land-
floods, and dilateth $o, that it covereth all the Meadows there-
abouts, nor doth it receive with the wonted facility the Drains of
the upper Grounds, of which the next unto it lying under the wa-
ters that return upwards by the Conveyances, and the more re-
mote, not finding a pa$$age for Rain-waters that $ettle, become
either altogether unpro$itable or little better.</P>
<P>From this Valley, by the Trench or Ditch of <I>Marzara,</I> or of
<I>la Duca</I> by <I>la Buova,</I> or mouth of <I>Ca$taldo de Ro$$i,</I> and by the
new pa$$age it falleth into the P<I>o</I> of <I>Argenta,</I> which being to re-
ceive it clear, that $o it may $ink farther therein, and receiving
it muddy, becau$e it hath acquired a quicker cour$e, there will
ari$e a very contrary effect.</P>
<P>Here therefore the $uperficies of the water keeping high, until
it come to the Sea, hindereth the Valleys of <I>Ravenna,</I> where
the River <I>Senio,</I> tho$e of <I>San Bernardino</I> where <I>Santerno</I> was
turned, tho$e of <I>Buon' acqui$to,</I> and tho$e of <I>Marmorto,</I> where
the <I>Idice, Quaderna, Sellero</I> $all in, from $wallowing and taking
in their Waters by their u$ual In-lets, yet many times, as I my
$elf have $een in the <I>Vi$itation,</I> they drink them up plentifully,
whereupon, being conjoyned with the muddine$$e of tho$e Ri-
vers that fall into the $ame, they $well, and dilate, and overflow
$ome grounds, and deprive others of their Drains in like manner
<foot>as</foot>
<p n=>102</p>
as hath been $aid of that of <I>Marrara,</I> in$omuch that from the
Point of S. <I>Giorgio,</I> as far as S. <I>Alberto</I> all tho$e that are between
the Valleys and P<I>o</I> are $poiled, of tho$e that are between Valley
and Valley many are in a very bad condition, and tho$e that are
$ome con$iderable $pace above not a little damnified.</P>
<P>In fine, by rai$ing the bottom or $and of the Valleys, and the
bed of <I>Reno,</I> and the too great repletion of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Primaro</I>
with waters, the Valleys of <I>Comacchio</I> (on which $ide the Banks
are very bad) and ^{*} <I>Pole$ine di</I> S. <I>Giorgio</I> are threatned with a

danger, that may in time, if it be not remedied, become irrepa-
rable, and at pre$ent feeleth the incommodity of the Waters,
which penetrating thorow the pores of the Earth do $pring up in
the $ame, which they call <I>Purlings,</I> which is all likely to redound
to the prejudice of <I>Ferrara,</I> $o noble a City of <I>Italy,</I> and $o im-
portant to the <I>Eccle$ta$tick State.</I></P>
<P>Which particulars all appear to be atte$ted under the hand of
a Notary in the <I>Vi$itation</I> which I made upon the command of
His Holine$$e, and are withall known to be true by the ^{*}<I>Ferrare$t</I>
<marg>* People of <I>Fer-

them$elves, of whom (be$ides the reque$t of the <I>Bologne$i</I>) the

dies, a$well for the mi$chiefs pa$t, as al$o for tho$e in time to
come, from which I hold it a duty of Con$cience, and of Cha-
rity to deliver them.</P>
<P>Pope <I>Clement</I> judged, that the $ufficient means to effect this
was the $aid Introduction of the <I>Main Po</I> into the Chancl of
<I>Ferrara</I>; a re$olution truly Heroical, and of no le$$e beauty
than benefit to that City, of which I $peak not at pre$ent, be-
cau$e I think that there is need of a readier and more acco-
modate remedy.</P>
<P>So that I $ee not how any other thing can be $o much con$ide-
rable as the removal of <I>Reno,</I> omitting for this time to $peak of
<marg>* In Chanels
made by hand.</marg>
^{*} inclo$ing it from Valley to Valley untill it come to the Sea, as
the Dukes of <I>Ferrara</I> did de$ign, fora$much as all tho$e <I>Ferra-
re$i</I> that have intere$t in the <I>Pole$ine di</I> S. <I>Giorgio,</I> and on the
right hand of the P<I>o</I> of <I>Argenta</I> do not de$ire it, and do, but too
openly, prote$t again$t it; and becau$e that before the Chanel
were made as far as the Sea, many hundreds of years would be
$pent, and yet would not remedy the dammages of tho$e who
now are agrieved, but would much increa$e them, in regard the
Valleys would continue $ubmerged, the Drains $topped, and the
other Brooks ob$tructed, which would of nece$$ity drown not a
few Lands that lie between Valley and Valley; and in fine, in
regard it hath not from <I>San Martina</I> to the Sea for a $pace of $if-
ty miles a greater fall then 19, 8, 6, feet, it would want that force
which they them$elves who propound this project do require it to
<foot>have</foot>
<p n=>103</p>
have, that $o it may not depo$e the matter of the muddine$s when
it is intended to be let into <I>Volana.</I></P>
<P>So that making the Line of the bottome neer to <I>Vigarano,</I> it
would ri$e to tho$e prodigious termes that they do make bigger,
and they may thence expect tho$e mi$chiefs, for which they
will not admit of introducing it into the $aid P<I>o</I> of <I>Volana.</I></P>
<P>Among$t the wayes therefore that I have thought of for effect-
ing that $ame remotion, and which I have cau$ed to be viewed by
skilful men that have taken a level thereof, (with the a$$i$tance of
the venerable Father, <I>D. Benedetto Ca$telli</I> of <I>Ca$ina,</I> a man of
much fidelity and hone$ty, and no le$s expert in $uch like affairs
touching waters, than perfect in the <I>Mathematick</I> Di$ciplines) two
onely, the re$t being either too tedious, or too dangerous to the
City, have $eemed to me worthy, and one of them al$o more than
the other, to offer to your Lord$hip.</P>
<P>The one is to remit it into the Chanel of <I>Volana,</I> thorow which
it goeth of its own accord to the Sea.</P>
<P>The other is to turn it into <I>Main-Po</I> at <I>Stellata,</I> for, as at other
times it hath done, it will carry it to the Sea happily.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the making choice of the fir$t way, that
which $eemeth to per$wade us to it is, that we therein do nothing
that is new, in that it is but re$tored to the place whence it was
removed in the year 1522. in the time of Pope <I>Adrian,</I> by an
agreement made in way of contract, between <I>Alfon$o,</I> Duke of
<I>Ferrara,</I> and the <I>Bologne$i</I>; and that it was diverted for rea$ons,
that are either out of date, or el$e have been too long time
deferred.</P>
<P>In like manner the facility wherewith it may be effected, let-
ting it run into the divided P<I>o,</I> whereby it will be turned to <I>Fer-
rara,</I> or el$e carrying it by <I>Torre del Fondo,</I> to the mouth of <I>Ma$i,</I>
and from thence thorow the Trench made by the <I>Ferrare$i,</I>
along by <I>Panaro,</I> where al$o finding an ample Bed, and high and
thick Banks, that will $erve at other times for it, and for the wa-
ters of P<I>o,</I> there may a great expence be $pared.</P>
<P>That what ever its Fall be, it would maintain the $ame, not
having other Rivers, which with their Floods can hinder it; and
that running confined between good Banks, without doubt it
would not leave <I>la Motto</I> by the way; but e$pecially, that it
would be $ufficient if it came to <I>Codigoro,</I> where being a$$i$ted by
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, it would run no hazard of
having its Chanel filled up from thence downwards.</P>
<P>That there might thence many benefits be derived to the City,
by means of the Running Waters, and al$o no mean Navigation
might be expected.</P>
<P>On the contrary it is objected, That it is not convenient to
<foot>think</foot>
<p n=>104</p>
think of returning this Torrent into the divided P<I>o,</I> by rea$on of
the peril that would thence redound to this City.</P>
<P>And that going by <I>Torre del Fondo,</I> through <I>Sanmartina</I> to
the Mouth <I>de Ma$i</I> by the Chappel of <I>Vigarano</I> unto the Sea, it is
by this way 70. miles; nor is the Fall greater than 26. 5. 6. Feet, $o
that it would come to fall but 4. inches &amp; an half, or thereabouts
in a mile; whereas the common opinion of the skilfull (to the
end that the Torrents may not depo$e their $and that they bring
with them in Land-Floods) requireth the twenty fourth part of
the hundredth part of their whole length, which in our ca$e,
accounting according to the mea$ure of the$e places, is 16. inches
<marg>* The inch of
the$e places is
$omewhat bigger
than ours.</marg>
a ^{*} mile; whereupon the $inking of the Mud and Sand would
mo$t certainly follow, and $o an immen$e heightning of the Line
of the Bottom, and con$equently a nece$$ity of rai$ing the Banks,
the impo$$ibility of maintaining them, the danger of breaches
and decayes, things very prejudicial to the <I>I$lets</I> of this City, and
of <I>San Giorgio,</I> the ob$truction of the Drains, which from the
Tower of <I>Tienne</I> downwards, fall into the $aid Chanel; to wit,
tho$e of the Sluices of <I>Goro,</I> and the Drains, of the Meadows of
<I>Ferrara</I>: And moreover, the damages that would ari$e unto the
$aid <I>I$let</I> of S. <I>Giorgio,</I> and the Valleys of <I>Comachio,</I> by the wa-
ters that $hould enter into the <I>Goro</I> or Dam of the Mills of <I>Belri-
guardo,</I> thorow the Trenches of <I>Quadrea,</I> which cannot be $topt,
becau$e they belong to the Duke of <I>Modena,</I> who hath right of
diverting the waters of that place at his plea$ure to the work of
turning Mills.</P>
<P>The greater part of which Objections, others pretend to prove
frivolous, by $aying, that its running there till at the la$t it was
turned another way, is a $ign that it had made $uch an elevation
of the Line, of its Bed as it required; denying that it needeth
$o great a declivity as is mentioned above; and that for the fu-
ture it would ri$e no more.</P>
<P>That the $aid Dra ns and Ditches did empty into the $ame,
whil$t P<I>o</I> was there; $o that they mu$t needs be more able to do
$o when onely <I>Reno</I> runs that way.</P>
<P>That there would no Breaches follow, or if they did, they
would be onely of the water of <I>Reno,</I> which in few hours might
be taken away (in tho$e parts they call damming up of Breaches,
and mending the Bank, <I>taking away the Breaches</I>) and its a que-
$tion whether they would procure more inconvenience than bene-
fit, for that its Mud and Sand might in many places, by filling
them up, occa$ion a $ea$onable improvement.</P>
<P>Now omitting to di$cour$e of the $olidity of the rea$ons on the
one$ide, or on the other, I will produce tho$e that move me to
$u$pend my allowance of this de$ign.</P>
<foot>The</foot>
<p n=>105</p>
<P>The fir$t is, that although I dare not $ub$cribe to the opinion
of tho$e that require 16. inches Declivity in a mile to <I>Reno,</I> to
prevent its depo$ing of Mud; yet would I not be the Author that
$hould make a trial of it with $o much hazard, for having to $a-
tisfie my $elf in $ome particulars cau$ed a Level to be taken of
the Rivers <I>L'amone, Senio,</I> and <I>Santerno,</I> by <I>Bernardino Aleotti,</I>
we found that they have more Declivity by much than Arti$ts re-
quire, as al$o the <I>Reno</I> hath from <I>la Botta de Ghi$lieri</I> to the
Chappel of <I>Vigarano,</I> for in the $pace of four miles its Bottom-
Line falleth five feet and five inches. So that I hold it greater
prudence to depend upon that example, than to go contrary to a
common opinion, e$pecially $ince, that the effects cau$ed by <I>Reno</I>
it $elf do confirm me in the $ame, for when it was for$aken by
the P<I>o,</I> after a few years, either becau$e it had choaked up its
Chanel with Sand, or becau$e its too long journey did increa$e
it, it al$o naturally turned a$ide, and took the way of the $aid
P<I>o</I> towards <I>Stellata.</I> Nay, in tho$e very years that it did run that
way, it only began (as relations $ay) to make Breaches, an evi-
dent $ign that it doth depo$e Sand, and rai$e its Bed; which a-
greeth with the te$timony of $ome that were examined in the
<I>Vi$itation</I> of the Publique Notary, who found great benefit by
having Running Water, and $ome kind of pa$$age for Boats,
and yet neverthele$s affirm that it for want of Running Water
had made too high Stoppages and Shelfes of Sand; $o that if
it $hould be re$tored to the Cour$e that it for$ook, I much fear
that after a $hort time, if not $uddenly, it would leave it a-
again.</P>
<P>The $econd I take from the ob$ervation of what happened to
<I>Panaro,</I> when with $o great applau$e of the <I>Ferare$i,</I> it was
brought by Cardinal <I>Serra</I> into the $aid Chanel of <I>Volana</I>; for
that notwith$tanding that it had Running Waters in much grea-
ter abundance than <I>Reno</I>; yet in the time that it continued in
that Chanel it rai$ed its Bed well neer five feet, as is to be $een
below the Sluice made by Cardinal <I>Capponi</I> to his new Chanel;
yea, the $aid Cardinal <I>Serra</I> who de$ired that this his under taking
$hould appear to have been of no danger nor damage, was con-
$trained at its Overflowings, to give it Vent into <I>Sanmartina,</I> that
it might not break in upon, and prejudice the City; which dan-
ger I $hould more fear from <I>Reno,</I> in regard it carrieth a greater
abundance of Water and Sand</P>
<P>Thirdly, I am much troubled (in the uncertainty of the $uc-
ce$s of the affair) at the great expence thereto required; For in
regard I do not approve of letting it in, neer to the Fortre$$e,
for many re$pects, and carrying it by <I>la Torre del Fondo</I> to the
Month <I>de Ma$t,</I> it will take up eight miles of double Banks, a
<foot>Pppp thing</foot>
<p n=>106</p>
thing not ea$ie to be procured, by rea$on that the Grounds lie
under Water; but from the Mouth <I>de Ma$i</I> unto <I>Codigoro,</I> it
would al$o be nece$$ary to make new Scowrings of the Chanel;
to the end, that the Water approaching (by wearing and carry-
ing away the Earth on both $hores, might make a Bed $ufficient
for its Body, the depth made for <I>Panaro</I> not $erving the turn, as
I conceive; and if it $hould $uffice, when could the people of
<I>Ferrara</I> hope to be re-imbur$ed and $atisfied for the charge
thereof?</P>
<P>Fourthly, it $erves as an Argument with me, to $ee that the
very individual per$ons concerned in the Remotion or Diver$ion
of the $aid Torrent, namely, the <I>Bologne$i</I> do not incline unto it,
and that the whole City of <I>Ferrara,</I> even tho$e very per$ons who
at pre$ent receive damage by it, cannot indure to hear thereof.
The rea$on that induceth the$e la$t named to be $o aver$e thereto,
is, either becau$e that this undertaking will render the introducti-
on of the Water of <I>Main-Po</I> more difficult; or becau$e they fear
the danger thereof; The others decline the Project, either for
that they know that <I>Reno</I> cannot long continue in that Cour$e,
or becau$e they fear that it is too much expo$ed to tho$e mens re-
vengeful Cutting of it who do not de$ire it $hould; and if a
man have any other wayes, he ought, in my opinion, to forbear
that, which to $uch as $tand in need of its Removal, is le$$e $ati$-
factory, and to $uch as oppo$e it, more prejudicial.</P>
<P>To conclude, I exceedingly honour the judgment of Cardinal
<I>Capponi,</I> who having to his Natural Ability and Prudence added
a particular Study, Ob$ervation, and Experience of the$e Wa-
ters for the $pace of three years together, doth not think that
<I>Reno</I> can go by <I>Volana</I>; to which agreeth the opinion of Car-
dinal S. <I>Marcello,</I> Legate of this City, of whom, for his exqui-
$ite under$tanding, we ought to make great account. But if e-
ver this $hould be re$olved on, it would be materially nece$$ary
to unite the Quick and Running Waters of the little Chanel of
<I>Cento,</I> of the Chanel <I>Navilio,</I> of <I>Guazzaloca,</I> and at its very
beginning tho$e of <I>Dardagna,</I> which at pre$ent, is one of the
Springs or Heads of <I>Panaro,</I> that $o they might a$$i$t it in carry-
ing its Sand, and the matter of its Muddine$s into the Sea; and
then there would not fail to be a greater evacuation and $cowr-
ing; but withall the Proprietors in the I$let of <I>San Giorgio</I> and
of <I>Ferrara</I> mu$t prepare them$elves to indure the inconveniences
of Purlings or Sewings of the Water from the River thorow
the Boggy Ground thereabouts.</P>
<P>I $hould more ea$ily incline therefore to carry it into <I>Main-Po</I>
at <I>Stellata,</I> for the Rea$ons that Cardinal <I>Capponi</I> mo$t ingeni-
ou$ly enumerates in a $hort, but well-grounded Tract of his: not
<foot>becau$e</foot>
<p n=>107</p>
becau$e that indeed it would not both by Purlings and by Brea-
ches occa$ion $ome inconvenience; e$pecially, in the beginning:
but becau$e I hold this for the incomodities of it, to be a far le$s
evil than any of the re$t; and becau$e that by this means there is
no occa$ion given to them of <I>Ferrara,</I> to explain that they are
deprived of the hope of ever $eeing the P<I>o</I> again under the Walls
of their City: To whom, where it may be done, it is but rea$on
that $atisfaction $hould be given.</P>
<P>It is certain that P<I>o</I> was placed by Nature in the mid$t of this
great Valley made by the <I>Appennine</I> Hills, and by the Alps, to
carry, as the Ma$ter-Drain to the Sea, that is the grand receptacle
of all Waters; tho$e particular $treams which de$cend from
them.</P>
<P>That the <I>Reno</I> by all Geographers, <I>Strabo, Pliuy, Solimas,
Mella,</I> and others is enumerated among the Rivers that fall into
the $aid P<I>o.</I></P>
<P>That although P<I>o</I> $hould of it $elf change its cour$e, yet would
<I>Reno</I> go to look it out, if the works erected by humane ind u$try
did not ob$truct its pa$$age; $o that it neither is, nor ought to
$eem $trange, if one for the greater common good $hould turn it
into the $ame.</P>
<P>Now at <I>Stellata</I> it may go $everal waies into P<I>o,</I> as appeareth
by the levels that were taken by my Order; of all which I $hould
be$t like the turning of it to <I>la Botta de' Ghi$lieri,</I> carrying it
above <I>Bondeno</I> to the Church of <I>Gambarone,</I> or a little higher or
lower, as $hall be judged lea$t prejudicial, when it cometh to the
execution, and this for two principal rea$ons: The one becau$e
that then it will run along by the confines of the Church P tri-
mony, without $eparating <I>Ferrara</I> from the re$t of it; The other
is, Becau$e the Line is $horter, and con$equently the fall greater;
for that in a $pace of ten miles and one third, it falleth twenty $ix
feet, more by much than is required by Arti$ts; and would go
by places where it could do but little hurt, notwith$tanding that
the per$ons interre$$ed $tudy to amplifie it incredibly.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there are but onely two objections that are
worthy to be examined; One, That the Drains and Ditches of
S. <I>Bianca,</I> of the Chanel of <I>Cento,</I> and of <I>Burana,</I> and all tho$e
others that enter into P<I>o,</I> do hinder this diver$ion of <I>Reno,</I> by the
encrea$ing of the waters in the P<I>o.</I> The other is that P<I>o</I> ri$ing
about the Tran$om of the <I>Pila$ter</I>-Sluice, very near 20 feet, the
<I>Reno</I> would have no fall into the $ame; whereupon it would ri$e
to a terrible height, at which it would not be po$$ible to make, or
keep the Banks made, $o that it would break out and drown
the Meadowes, and cau$e mi$chiefs, and damages un$peakable
and irreparable; as is evident by the experiment made upon
<foot>Pppp 2 <I>Pana-</I></foot>
<p n=>108</p>
<I>Panaro,</I> which being confined between Banks, that it might go
into P<I>o,</I> this not being neither in its greate$t excre$cen$e, it broke
out into the territories of <I>Final,</I> and of <I>Ferrara.</I> And though
that might be done, it would thereupon en$ue, that there being
let into the Chanel of P<I>o,</I> 2800, $quare feet of water (for $o much
we account tho$e of <I>Reno</I> and <I>Panaro,</I> taken together in their
greate$t heights) the $uperficies of it would ri$e at lea$t four feet,
in$omuch that either it would be requi$ite to rai$e its Banks all the
way unto the Sea, to the $ame height, which the trea$ures of the
<I>Indies</I> would not $uffice to effect; or el$e there would be a nece$-
$ity of enduring exce$$ive Breaches. To the$e two Heads are the
Arguments reduced, which are largely amplified again$t our opi-
nion; and I $hall an$wer fir$t to the la$t, as mo$t material.</P>
<P>I $ay therefore, that there are three ca$es to be con$idered:
Fir$t, P<I>o</I> high, and <I>Reno</I> low. Secondly, <I>Reno</I> high, and P<I>o</I>
low. Thirdly, <I>Reno</I> and P<I>o</I> both high together.</P>
<P>As to the fir$t and $econd, there is no difficulty in them; for if
P<I>o</I> $hall not be at its greate$t height, <I>Reno</I> $hall ever have a fall
into it, and there $hall need no humane Artifice about the Banks:
And if <I>Reno</I> $hall be low, P<I>o</I> $hall regurgitate and flow up into
the Chanel of it; and al$o from thence no inconvenience $hall
follow. The third remains, from which there are expected ma-
ny mi$chiefs; but it is a mo$t undoubted truth, that the excre$cen-
cies of <I>Reno,</I> as coming from the adjacent <I>Appennines</I> and Rains,
are to continue but $even, or eight hours at mo$t, and $o would
never, or very rarely happen to be at the $ame time with tho$e of
P<I>o,</I> cau$ed by the melting of the $nowes of the Alps, at lea$t 400.
miles di$tance from thence. But becau$e it $ometimes may hap-
pen, I reply, that when it cometh to pa$s, <I>Reno</I> $hall not go into
P<I>o,</I> but it $hall have allowed it one or two Vents; namely, into
the Chanel of <I>Ferrara,</I> as it hath ever had; and into <I>Sanmartina,</I>
where it runneth at pre$ent, and wherewith there is no doubt, but
that the per$ons concerned will be well plea$ed, it being a great
benefit to them, to have the water over-flow their grounds once
every four or five years, in$tead of $eeing it anoy them continu-
ally. Yea, the Vent may be regulated, re$erving for it the Cha-
nel in which <I>Reno</I> at pre$ent runneth; and in$tead of turning it
by a Dam at <I>la Betta de Chi$lieri,</I> perhaps, to turn it by help of
$trong Sluices, that may upon all occa$ions be opened and $hut.
And for my part, I do not que$tion but that the Proprietors
them$elves in <I>Sanmartina</I> would make a Chanel for it; which
receiving, and confining it in the time of the Vents, might carry
the Sand into the P<I>o</I> of <I>Primaro:</I> Nor need there thence be fear-
ed any $toppage by Mud and Sand, $ince that it is $uppo$ed that
there will but very $eldom be any nece$$ity of u$ing it; $o that
<foot>time</foot>
<p n=>109</p>
time would be allowed, upon occa$ion, to $cowr and clean$e
it.</P>
<P>And in this manner all tho$e Prodigies vani$h that are rai$ed
with $o much fear from the enterance of the Water of <I>Reno</I>
$welled into P<I>o,</I> when it is high, to which there needeth no other
an$wer; yet neverthele$$e we do not take that quantity of Wa-
ter, that is carried by <I>Reno,</I> and by <I>Panaro,</I> to be $o great as is affir-
med: For that P. D. <I>Benedetto Ca$telli</I> hath no le$$e accutely
than accurately ob$erved the mea$ures of this kind, noting that
the breadth and depth of a River is not enough to re$olve the
que$tion truly, but that there is re$pect to be had to the velocity
of the Waters, and the term of time, things hitherto not con$i-
dered by the Skilful in the$e affairs; and therefore they are not
able to $ay what quantity of Waters the $aid Rivers carry, nor
to conclude of the ri$ings that will follow thereupon. Nay, it
is mo$t certain, that if all the Rivers that fall into <I>Po,</I> which are
above thirty, $hould ri$e at the rate that the$e compute <I>Reno</I> to
do, an hundred feet of Banks would not $uffice, and yet they
have far fewer: So that this confirmes the Rule of R. P. D. <I>Bene-
detto,</I> namely, that the proportion of the height of the Water
of <I>Reno</I> in <I>Reno</I> to the height of the Water of <I>Reno</I> in P<I>o,</I> is
compounded of the proportion of the breadth of the Chanel of
<I>Po</I> to that of <I>Reno,</I> and of the velocity of the Water of <I>Reno</I>
in <I>Po</I> to the velccity of the Water of <I>Reno</I> in <I>Reno</I>; a manife$t
argument that there cannot in it, by this new augmentation of
Waters follow any alteration that nece$$itates the rai$ing of its
Banks, as appeareth by the example of <I>Panaro,</I> which hath been
$o far from $welling P<I>o,</I> that it hath rather a$$waged it, for it hath
carried away many Shelfs and many I$lets that had grown in its
Bed, for want of Waters $ufficient to bear away the matter of
Land-floods in $o broad a Chanel; and as is learnt by the trial
made by us in <I>Panaro</I> with the Water of <I>Burana</I>; for erecting
in the River $tanding marks, and $hutting the $aid Sluice, we could
$ee no $en$ible abatement, nor much le$s after we had opened it
$en$ible increa$ment; by which we judge that the $ame is to $uc-
ceed to P<I>o,</I> by letting in of <I>Reno, Burana</I> having greater pro-
portion to <I>Panaro</I> than <I>Reno</I> to P<I>o,</I> con$idering the $tate of tho$e
Rivers in which the Ob$ervation was made. So that there is no
longer any occa$ion for tho$e great rai$ings of Banks, and the
danger of the ruptures as well of <I>Reno</I> as of P<I>o</I> do vani$h, as al-
$o the fear le$t that the Sluices which empty into P<I>o</I> $hould re-
ceive ob$truction: which if they $hould, yet it would be over in
a few hours. And as to the Breaches of <I>Panaro</I> which happened
in 1623. I know not why, $eeing that it is confe$$ed that the P<I>o</I>
was not, at that time, at its height, one $hould rather charge it
<foot>with</foot>
<p n=>110</p>
with the crime, than quit it thereof. The truth is, that the
Bank was not made of proof, $ince that the $ame now continu-
eth whole and good, and <I>Panaro</I> doth not break out; nay, there
was, when it brake more than a foot and half of its Banks above
the Water, and to $pare; but it broke thorow by a Moles wor-
king, or by the hole of a Water-Rat, or $ome $uch vermine;
and by occa$ion of the badne$s of the $aid Banks, as I finde by
the te$timony of $ome witne$$es examined by my command, that
I might know the truth thereof. Nor can I here forbear to $ay,
that it would be better, if in $uch matters men were more candid
and $incere. But to $ecure our $elves neverthele$$e, to the ut-
mo$t of our power, from $uch like Breaches which may happen
at the fir$t, by rea$on of the newne$$e of the Banks, I pre$uppo$e
that from P<I>o</I> unto the place whence <I>Reno</I> is cut, there ought to
be a high and thick Fence made with its Banks, $o that there
would be no cau$e to fear any what$oever acce$$ions of Water,
although that concurrence of three Rivers, which was by $ome
more ingeniou$ly aggravated than faithfully $tated by that which
was $aid above were true; to whom I think not my $elf bound
to make any farther reply, neither to tho$e who $ay that <I>Po</I> will
a$cend upwards into <I>Reno,</I> $ince that the$e are the $ame per$ons
who would introduce a $mall branch of the $aid P<I>o</I> into the
Chanel of <I>Ferrara,</I> that $o it may conveigh to the Sea, not <I>Reno</I>
onely, but al$o all the other Brooks of which we complained;
and becau$e that withal it is impo$$ible, that a River $o capacious
as <I>Po</I> $hould be incommoded by a Torrent, that, as I may $ay,
hath no proportion to it.</P>
<P>I come now to the bu$ine$$e of the Ditches and Draines; and
as to the Conveyance of <I>Burana,</I> it hath heretofore been deba-
ted to turn it into <I>Main-Po,</I> $o that in this ca$e it will receive no
harm, and though it were not removed, yet would it by a Trench
under ground pur$ue the cour$e that it now holdeth, and al$o
would be able to di$-imbogue again into the $aid new Chanel of
<I>Reno,</I> which conforming to the $uperficies of the Water of <I>Po,</I>
would continue at a lower level than that which <I>Panara</I> had
when it came to <I>Ferrara,</I> into which <I>Burana</I> did neverthele$$e
empty it $elf for $ome time.</P>
<P>The Conveyance or Drain of <I>Santa Bianca,</I> and the little
Chanel of <I>Cento</I> may al$o empty them$elves by two $ubterranean
Trenches, without any prejudice where they run at pre$ent, or
without any more works of that nature, they may be turned into
the $aid new Chanel, although with $omewhat more of incon-
venience; and withall, the Chanel of <I>Ferrara,</I> left dry, would
be a $ufficient receptacle for any other Sewer or Drain what$oe-
ver, that $hould remain there.</P>
<foot>All</foot>
<p n=>111</p>
<P>All which Operations might be brought to perfection with
150. thou$and Crowns, well and faithfully laid out; which $umm
the <I>Bologne$i</I> will not be unwilling to provide; be$ides that tho$e
<I>Ferrare$i</I> ought to contribute to it, who $hall partake of the
benefit.</P>
<P>Let me be permitted in this place to propo$e a thing which I
have thought of, and which peradventure might occa$ion two
benefits at once, although it be not wholly new. It was in the
time of <I>Pope Paul</I> V. propounded by one <I>Cre$cenzio</I> an Ingi-
neer, to cut the <I>Main-Po,</I> above <I>le Papozze</I>; and having made a
$ufficient evacuation to derive the water thereof into the P<I>o</I> of
<I>Adriano,</I> and $o to procure it to be Navigable, which was not at
that time effected, either by rea$on of the oppo$itions of tho$e,
who$e po$$e$$ions were to be cut thorow, or by rea$on of the
great $um of money that was nece$$ary for the effecting of it: But
in viewing tho$e Rivers, we have ob$erved, that the $edge cutting
might ea$ily be made below <I>le Papozze,</I> in digging thorow the
Bank called <I>Santa Maria,</I> &amp; drawing a Trench of the bigne$s that
skilful Arti$ts $hall judge meet unto the P<I>o</I> ^{*} of <I>Ariano,</I> below the
<marg>* Of <I>Adri&amacr;n<*>.</I></marg>
<I>Secche</I> of the $aid S. <I>Maria</I>; which as being a work of not
above 160. Perches in length, would be fini$hed with onely
12000. Crowns.</P>
<P>Fir$t; it is to be believed, that the waters running that way,
would not fail to open that Mouth into the Sea, which at pre-
$ent is almo$t choakt up by the Shelf of Sand, which the new
Mouth of <I>Ponto Virro</I> hath brought thither; and that it would
again bring into u$e the Port <I>Goro,</I> and its Navigation.</P>
<P>And haply experience might teach us, that the $uperficies of
P<I>o</I> might come to fall by this a$$wagement of Water, $o that the
acce$$ion of <I>Reno</I> would que$tionle$s make no ri$ing in it:
Whereupon, if it $hould $o fall out, tho$e Princes would have
no rea$on to complain; who $eem to que$tion, le$t by this new
acce$$ion of water into P<I>o,</I> the Sluices might be endangered.
Which I thought not fit to omit to repre$ent to your Lord$hip;
not, that I propo$e it to you as a thing ab$olutely certain, but that
you might, if you $o plea$ed, lay it before per$ons who$e judge-
ments are approved in the$e affairs.</P>
<P>I return now from where I degre$t, and affirm it as indubita-
ble, that <I>Reno</I> neither can, nor ought to continue longer where
it at this day is; and that it cannot go into any other place but
that, whither <I>Cardinal Capponi</I> de$igned to carry it, and which
at pre$ent plea$eth me better than any other; or into <I>Volana,</I>
whence it was taken away; the vigilance of Men being able to
obviate part of tho$e mi$chiefs, which it may do there.</P>
<P>But from its Removal, be$ides the alleviation of the harm
<foot>which</foot>
<p n=>112</p>
which by it $elf is cau$ed, there would al$o re$ult the diminution
of that which is occa$ioned by the other Brooks, to the right hand
of the <I>Po</I> of <I>Argenta</I>; fora$much as the $aid <I>Po</I> wanting all the
water of <I>Reno,</I> it would of nece$$ity come to ebb in $uch man-
ner, that the Valleys would have a greater Fall into the $ame,
and con$equently it would take in, and $wallow greater abun-
dance of water; and by this means the Ditches and Draines
of the Up-Lands would likewi$e more ea$ily Fall into them; e$-
pecially if the $couring of <I>Zenzalino</I> were brought to perfection,
by which the waters of <I>Marrara</I> would fall into <I>Marmorta</I>: And
if al$o that of <I>Ba$tia</I> were enlarged, and fini$hed, by which there
might enter as much water into the $aid P<I>o</I> of <I>Argenta,</I> as is taken
from it by the removal of <I>Reno</I>; although that by that meanes
the water of the Valleys would a$$wage double: Nor would the
people of <I>Argenta,</I> the I$les of S. <I>Giorgio,</I> and <I>Comacchio</I> have any
cau$e to complain; for that there would not be given to them
more water than was taken away: Nay $ometimes whereas they
had Muddy waters, they would have clear; nor need they to fear
any ri$ing: And furthermore, by this means a very great quan-
tity of ground would be re$tored to culture; For the effecting of
all which, the $umm of 50. thou$and Crowns would go very far,
and would $erve the turn at pre$ent touching tho$e Brooks, car-
rying them a little farther in the mean time, to fill up the greater
cavities of the Valleys, that we might not enter upon a va$ter
and harder work, that would bring with it the difficulties of other
operations, and $o would hinder the benefit which the$e people
expect from the paternal charity of His Holine$s.</P>

<head>TO
The Right Honourable,
MONSIGNORE
D. Ferrante Ce$arini.</head>
<P>My Treati$e of the MENSURATION of RUN-
NING WATERS, Right Honourable, and
mo$t Noble Sir, hath not a greater Preroga-
tive than its having been the production of the
command of Pope <I>Vrban</I> VIII. when His Ho-
line$s was plea$ed to enjoyn me to go with
<I>Mon$ignore Cor$ini,</I> in the Vi$itation that was
impo$ed upon him in the year 1625. of the Waters of <I>Ferrara,
Bologna, Romagna,</I> and <I>Romagnola</I>; for that, on that occa$ion
applying my whole Study to my $ervice and duty, I publi$hed in
that Treati$e $ome particulars till then not rightly under$tood and
con$idered (that I knew) by any one; although they be in them-
$elves mo$t important, and of extraordinary con$equence. Yet
I mu$t render thanks to Your Lord$hip for the honour you have
done to that my Tract; but wi$h withal, that your E$teem of it
may not prejudice the univer$al E$teem that the World hath of
Your Honours mo$t refined judgement.</P>
<P>As to that Point which I touch upon in the Conclu$ion, name-
ly, That the con$ideration of the Velocity of Running Water $up-
plyeth the con$ideration of the ^{*} Length omitted in the common
<marg>* Larghezza, but
mi$printed.</marg>
way of mea$uring Running Waters; Your Lord$hip having com-
manded me that in favour of <I>Practi$e,</I> and for the perfect di$co-
very of the di$order that commonly happeneth now adayes in
the di$tribution of the Waters of Fountains, I $hould demon-
$trate that the knowledge of the Velocity $erveth for the finding
of the Length: I have thought fit to $atisfie your Command by
relating a Fable; which, if I do not deceive my $elf, will make
out to us the truth thereof; in$omuch that the re$t of my Treati$e
$hall thereby al$o become more manife$t and intelligible, even to
<foot>Qqqq tho$e</foot>
<p n=>432</p>
tho$e who finde therein $ome kinde of ob$curity.</P>
<P>In the dayes of yore, before that the admirable Art of Wea-
ving was in u$e, there was found in <I>Per$ia</I> a va$tand unvaluable
Trea$ure, which con$i$ted in an huge multitude of pieces of Er-
me$in, or Damask, I know not whether; which, as I take it,
amounted to near two thou$and pieces; which were of $uch a
nature, that though their Breadth and Thickne$s were finite and
determinate, as they u$e to be at this day; yet neverthele$s, their
Length was in a certain $en$e infinite, for that tho$e two thou$and
pieces, day and night without cea$ing, i$$ued out with their ends
at $uch a rate, that of each piece there i$$ued 100. Ells a day, from
a deep and dark Cave, con$ecrated by the Super$tition of tho$e
people, to the fabulous <I>Arachne.</I> In tho$e innocent and early
times (I take it to have been, in that $o much applauded and
de$ired Golden age) it was left to the liberty of any one, to cut
off of tho$e pieces what quantity they plea$ed without any diffi-
culty: But that felicity decaying and degenerating, which was
altogether ignorant of <I>Meum</I> and <I>Tuum</I>; terms certainly mo$t
pernicious, the Original of all evils, and cau$e of all di$cords;
there were by tho$e people $trong and vigilant Guards placed
upon the Cave, who re$olved to make merchandize of the Stuffes;
and in this manner they began to $et a price upon that ine$tima-
ble Trea$ure, $elling the propriety in tho$e pieces to divers Mer-
chants; to $ome they $old a right in one, to $ome in two, and to
$ome in more. But that which was the wor$t of all, There was
found out by the in$atiable avarice of the$e men crafty inventions
to deceive the Merchants al$o; who came to buy the afore$aid
commodity, and to make them$elves Ma$ters, $ome of one
$ome of two, and $ome of more ends of tho$e pieces of $tuff;
and in particular, there were certain ingenuous Machines placed
in the more $ecret places of the Cave, with which at the plea$ure
of the Guards, they did retard the velocity of tho$e Stuffs, in
their i$$uing out of the Cave; in$omuch, that he who ought to have
had 100. Ells of Stuff in a day, had not above 50, and he who
$hould have had 400, enjoyed the benefit of 50. onely; and $o all
the re$t were defrauded of their Rights, the $urplu$age being $old,
appropriated, and $hared at the will of the corrupt Officers: So
that the bu$ine$s was without all order or ju$tice, in$omuch that
the Godde$s <I>Arachne</I> being di$plea$ed at tho$e people, deprived
every one of their benefit, and with a dreadful Earthquake for
ever clo$ing the mouth of the Cave, in puni$hment of $o much
impiety and malice: Nor did it avail them to excu$e them$elves,
by $aying that they allowed the Buyer the Breadth and Thick-
ne$s bargained for; and that of the Length, which was infinite,
<foot>there</foot>
<p n=>115</p>
there could no account be kept: For the wi$e and prudent
Prie$t of the Sacred <I>Grotto</I> an$wered, That the deceit lay in the
length, which they were defrauded of, in that the velocity of the
ftuffe was retarded, as it i$$ued out of the Cave: and although
the total length of the Piece was infinite, for that it never cea-
$ed coming forth, and $o was not to be computed; yet never-
thele$s its length con$idered, part by part, as it came out of the
Cave, and was bargained for, continued $till finite, and might
be one while greater, and another while le$$er, according as the
Piece was con$tituted in greater or le$$er velocity; and he added
withall, that exact Ju$tice required, that when they $old a piece
of $tuff, and the propriety or dominion therein, they ought not
only to have a$certained the breadth and thickne$$e of the Piece,
but al$o to have determined the length, determining its ve-
locity.</P>
<P>The $ame di$order and confu$ion, that was repre$ented in the
Fable, doth come to pa$$e in the Hi$tory of the Di$tribution of
the Waters of Conduits and Fountains, $eeing that they are $old
and bought, having regard only to the two Dimen$ions, I mean
of Breadth and Height of the Mouth that di$chargeth the Wa-
ter; and to remedy $uch an inconvenience, it is nece$$ary to de-
termine the length in the velocity; for never $hall we be able to
make a gue$$e at the quantity of the Body of Running Water,
with the two Dimen$ions only of Breadth and Height, without
Length.</P>
<P>And to the end, that the whole bu$ine$s may be reduced
to a mo$t ea$ie practice, by which the waters of Aqueducts
may be bought and $old ju$tly, and with mea$ures alwayes ex-
act and con$tant.</P>
<P>Fir$t, the quantity of the Water ought diligently to be exa-
mined, which the whole principal ^{*} Pipe di$chargeth in a time
certain, as for in$tance, in an hour, in half an hour, or in a le$$e
interval of time, (for knowing which I have a mo$t exact and
ea$ie Rule) and finding that the whole principal pipe di$char-
geth <I>v. g.</I> a thou$and Tuns of Water in the $pace of one or
more hours, in $elling of this water, it ought not to be uttered by
the ordinary and fal$e mea$ure, but the di$tribution is to be
made with agreement to give and maintain to the buyer ten or
twenty, or a greater number of Tuns, as the bargain $hall be
made, in the $pace of an hour, or of $ome other $et and deter-
minate time. And here I adde, that if I were to undertake to
make $uch an adju$tment, I would make u$e of a way to divide
and mea$ure the time with $uch accuratene$$e, that the $pace of
an hour $hould be divided into four, $ix, or eight thou$and parts
<foot>Qqqq 2 with-</foot>
<p n=>116</p>
without the lea$t errour; which Rule was taught me by my
Ma$ter <I>Sign. Galil&aelig;o Galil&aelig;i,</I> Chief Philo$opher to the mo$t Se-
rene <I>Grand Duke</I> of <I>Tu$cany.</I> And this way will $erve ea$ily and
admirably to our purpo$e and occa$ion; $o that we $hall
thereby be able to know how many Quarts of Water an A-
queduct will di$charge in a given time of hours, moneths, or
years. And in this manner we may con$titute a Cock that $hall
di$charge a certain and determinate quantity of water in a time
given.</P>
<P>And becau$e daily experience $hews us, that the Springs of A-
queducts do not maintain them alwayes equally high, and full
of Water, but that $ometimes they increa$e, and $ometimes de-
crea$e, which accident might po$$ibly procure $ome difficulty in
our di$tribution: Therefore, to the end that all manner of $cru-
ple may be removed, I conceive that it would be convenient to
provide a Ci$tern, according to the occa$ion, into which there
might alwayes fall one certain quantity of water, which $hould
not be greater than that which the principal pipe di$chargeth in
times of drought, when the Springs are bare of water, that $o in
this Ci$tern the water might alwayes keep at one con$tant height.
Then to the Ci$tern $o prepared we are to fa$ten the Cocks of
particular per$ons, to whom the Water is $old by the Reverend
Apo$tolique Chamber, according to what hath been ob$erved
before; and that quantity of Water which remaineth over and
above, is to be di$charged into another Ci$tern, in which the
Cocks of the Waters for publick $ervices, and of tho$e which
people buy upon particular occa$ions are to be placed. And
when the bu$ine$$e $hall have been brought to this pa$$e, there
will likewi$e a remedy be found to the $o many di$orders that
continually happen; of which, for brevity $ake, I will in$tance
in but four only, which concern both publique and private bene-
fit, as being, in my judgment, the mo$t enormous and intole-
rable.</P>
<P>The fir$t inconvenience is, that in the common way of mea$u-
ring, di$pen$ing, and $elling the Waters of Aqueducts, it is not
under$tood, neither by the Buyer nor Seller, what the quantity
truly is that is bought and $old; nor could I ever meet with any
either Engineer or Architect, or Arti$t, or other that was able to
decypher to me, what one, or two, or ten inches of water was.
But by our above declared Rule, for di$pen$ing the Waters of
Aqueducts we may very ea$ily know the true quantity of Water
that is bought or $old, as that it is $o many Tuns an hour, $o ma-
ny a day, $o many in a year, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The $econd di$order that happeneth, at pre$ent, in the di$tri-
<foot>buting</foot>
<p n=>117</p>
bution of Aqueducts is, that as the bu$ine$$e is now governed, it
lieth in the power of a $ordid Ma$on to take unju$tly from one,
and give unde$ervedly to another more or le$$e Water than be-
longeth to them of right: And I have $een it done, of my
own experience. But in our way of mea$uring and di$tri-
buting Waters, there can no fraud be committed; and put-
ting the ca$e that they $hould be committed, its an ea$ie mat-
ter to know it, and amend it, by repairing to the Tribunal
appointed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it happens very often, (and we have examples there-
of both antient and modern) that in di$pen$ing the Water after
the common and vulgar way; there is $ometimes more Water di$-
pended than there is in the Regi$ter, in which there will be regi-
$tred, as they $ay, two hundred inches (for example) and there
will be di$pen$ed two hundred and fifty inches, or more. Which
pa$$age happened in the time of <I>Nerva</I> the Emperour, as <I>Giulio
Frontino</I> writes, in his 2. Book, <I>De Aquaductibus Vrbis Rom&aelig;,</I>
where he ob$erveth that they had <I>in Commentariis 12755. Qui-
naries</I> of Water; and found that they di$pen$ed 14018. <I>Qui-
naries.</I> And the like Errour hath continued, and is in u$e al$o
modernly until our times. But if our Rule $hall be ob$erved,
we $hall incur no $uch di$order, nay there will alwayes be given
to every one his $hare, according to the holy end of exact ju$tice,
which <I>dat unicuique quod $uum e$t.</I> As on the contrary, it is
manife$t, that His Divine Maje$ty hateth and abominateth <I>Pon-
dus &amp; pondus, Men$ura &amp; men$ura,</I> as the Holy Gho$t $peak-
eth by the mouth of <I>Solomon</I> in the <I>Proverbs, Chap. 20. Pondus
&amp; Pondus, Men$ura &amp; Men$ura, utrumque abominabile e$t apud
Deum.</I> And therefore who is it that $eeth not that the way of
dividing and mea$uring of Waters, commonly u$ed, is expre$ly
again$t the Law of God. Since that thereby the $ame mea$ure
is made $ometimes greater, and $ometimes le$$er; A di$order $o
enormous and execrable, that I $hall take the boldne$s to $ay, that
for this $ole re$pect it ought to be condemned and prohibited like-
wi$e by human Law, which $hould Enact that in this bu$ine$s there
$hould be imployed either this our Rule, or $ome other that
is more exqui$ite and practicable, whereby the mea$ure
might keep one con$tant and determinate tenor, as we make it,
and not, as it is now, to make <I>Pondus &amp; Pondus, Men$ur a &amp;
Men$ura.</I></P>
<P>And this is all that I had to offer to Your mo$t Illu$trious
Lord$hip, in obedience to your commands, re$erving to my $elf
the giving of a more exact account of this my invention, when
the occa$ion $hall offer, of reducing to practice $o holy, ju$t, and
<foot>nece$$ary</foot>
<p n=>118</p>
nece$$ary a reformation of the Mea$ure of Running Waters and
of Aqueducts in particular: which Rule may al$o be of great
benefit in the divi$ion of the greater Waters to over-flow
Grounds, and for other u$es: I humbly bow,</P>

teth, in my thinking, to your Speculative
<marg><I>It is a large field
for Wits to Philo-

Wits, a large field to Philo$ophate in:
and more particularly, as to that part
which is called the <I>Mechanicks:</I> in re-
gard that there all kinds of Engines, and
Machines are continually put in u$e, by a
huge number of Artificers of all $orts;
among$t whom, as well through the ob$ervations of their Prede-
ce$$ors, as tho$e, which through their own care they continually
are making, it's probable, that there are $ome very learned, and
bravely di$cours'd Men.</P>
<P>SAGR. Sir, you are not therein mi$taken: and I my $elf, out of
<foot>B 2</foot>
<p n=>2</p>
a natural Curio$itie, do frequentlie for my Recreation vi$it that
place, and confer with the$e per$ons; which for a certain prehe-
<marg>* Proti.</marg>
minence that they have above the re$t we call ^{*} <I>Over$eers</I>: who$e
di$cour$e hath oft helped me in the inve$tigation of not only won-
derful, but ab$truce, and incredible Effects: and indeed I have been
at a lo$$e $ometimes, and de$paired to penetrate how that could
po$$ibly come to pa$$e, which far from all expectation my $en$es
demon$trated to be true; and yet that which not long $ince that
good Old man told us, is a $aying and propo$ition, though com-
<marg><I>The Opinion of
Common Artificers
are often fal$e.</I></marg>
mon enough, yet in my opinion wholly vain, as are many others,
often in the mouths of unskilful per$ons; introduced by them, as
I $uppo$e, to $hew that they under$tand how to $peak $omething
about that, of which neverthele$$e they are incapable.</P>
<P>SALV. It may be Sir, you $peak of that la$t propo$ition which
he affirmed, when we de$ired to under$tand, why they made
<marg><I>Great Ships apter
than others to break
their Keels in
Launching, accor-
ding to $ome.</I></marg>
$o much greater provi$ion of $upporters, and other provi$ions,
and reinforcements about that Galea$$e, which was to be launcht
than is made about le$$er Ve$$els, and he an$wered us, that they did
$o to avoid the peril of breaking its Keel, through the mighty
weight of its va$t bulk, an inconvenience to which le$$er $hips are
not subject.</P>
<P>SAGR. I do intend the $ame, and chiefly that la$t conclu$ion,
which he added to his others, and which I alwaies e$teemed a vain
conceit of the Vulgar, namely, That in the$e and other Machines
we mu$t not argue from the le$$e to the greater, becau$e many
Mechanical Inventions take in little, which hold not in great. But

That many Machines may be made more perfect in great than lit-

may be made more exact in one certain $ize, than in another le$$e.
With better ground is that $ame conclu$ion u$urped by other more
intelligent per$ons, who refer the cau$e of $uch effects in the$e
great Machines different from what is collected from the pure, and

Machines in concrete, to the $ame ab$tracted and Ideal: yet not-

<P>SAGR. I already feel my Brains to turn round, and my Mind,
(like a Cloud unwillingly opened by the Lightning,) I perceive
to be $urprized with a tran$cient, and unu$ual Light, which from
affar off twinkleth, and $uddenly a$toni$heth me; and with ab-
$truce, $trange, and indige$ted imaginations. And from what hath
been $poken, it $eems to follow, that, it is a thing impo$$ible to
frame two Fabricks of the $ame Matter, alike, and unequal, and
between them$elves in proportion equally able to Re$i$t; and
were it to be done, yet it would be impo$$ible to find two only
Launces of the $ame wood, alike between them$elves in $trength,
<marg><I>A Wooden Launce
fixed in a Wall at
Right-Angles, and
reduced to $uch a
length and thick-
ne$$e as that it may
endure, but made a

$ingly one and no
more.</I></marg>
and toughne$$e, but unequal in bigne$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. So it is Sir; and the better to a$$ure you that we con-
cur in opinion, I $ay, that if we take a Launce of wood of $uch a
length and thickne$$e, that being fixed fa$t <I>(v. g.)</I> in a Wall at
Right Angles, that is parallel to the Horizon, it is reduced to the
utmo$t length, that it will hold at, $o that lengthened never-
$o-little more, it would break, being over-burthened with its own
<foot>B 2 weight,</foot>
<p n=>4</p>
weight, there could not be another $uch-a-one in the World: So
that if its length (for example) were Centuple to its thickne$$e,
there cannot be found another Launce of the $ame Matter, that
being in length Centuple to its thickne$$e, $hall be able to $u$tain
it $elf preci$ely, as that did, and no more: for all that are bigger
$hall break, and the le$$er $hall be able, be$ides their own, to $u$tain
$ome additional weight. And this that I $ay of the <I>State of bear-
ing it $elf,</I> I would have under$tood to be $poken of every other
Con$titution, and thus if one Tran$ome bear or $u$tain the force
often Tran$omes equal to it, $uch another Beam cannot bear the
weight of ten that are equal to it. Now be plea$ed, Sir, and you
<marg><I>Truth upon a little
Courting, throweth
off her Vail, and
$hews her Secrets
maked.</I></marg>
<I>Simplicius</I> to ob$erve, how true Conclu$ions, though at the fir$t
$ight they $eem improbable, yet never $o little glanced at, do depo$e
the Vailes which ob$cure them, and make a voluntary $hew of their
$ecrets nakedly, and $imply. Who $ees not, that a Hor$e falling
<marg><I>Great Animals
receive more harm
by a fall than le$-
$er.</I></marg>
from a height of three or four yards, will break his bones, but a
Dog falling $o many yards, or a Cat eight or ten, will receive no
hurt; nor likewi$e a Gra$hopper from a Tower, nor an Ant thrown
from the Orbe of the Moon? Little Children e$cape all harm in
their falls, whereas per$ons grown up break either their $hins or
faces. And as le$$er Animals are in proportion more robu$tious,
and $trong than greater, $o the le$$er Plants better $upport them-
$elves: and I already believe, that both of you think, that an Oake
two hundred foot high could not $upport its branches $pread like
<marg><I>Nature could not
have made of mea-
ner Hor$es bigger,
and have retained
the $ame $trength,
but by altering
their Symetry.</I></marg>
one of an indifferent $ize; and that Nature could not have made
an Hor$e as big as twenty Hor$es, nor a Giant ten times as tall as a
Man, unle$$e $he did it either miraculou$ly, or el$e by much alte-
ring the proportion of the Members, and particularly of the Bones,
enlarging them very much above the Symetry of common Bones.
To $uppo$e likewi$e, that in Artificial Machines, the greater and
le$$er are with equal facility made, and pre$erved, is a manife$t Er-
rour: and thus for in$tance, $mall Spires, Pillars, and other $olid
figures may be $afely moved, laid along, and reared upright, with-
out danger of breaking them; but the very great upon every $ini-
$ter accident fall in pieces, and for no other rea$on but their own
weight. And here it is nece$$ary that I relate an accident, worthy
of notice, as are all tho$e events that occur unexpectedly, e$pecial-
ly when the means u$ed to prevent an inconvenience, proveth in
<marg><I>A great Marble
Pillar broken by
its own weight,
and why.</I></marg>
fine the mo$t potent cau$e of the di$order. There was a very great
Pillar of Marble laid along, and two Rowlers were put under the
$ame neer to the ends of it; it came into the mind of a certain In-
gineer $ome time after, that it would be expedient, the better to
$ecure it from breaking in the mid$t through its own weight, to
put under it in that part yet another Rowler: the coun$el $eemed
generally very $ea$onable, but the $ucce$$e demon$trated it to be
<foot>wholly</foot>
<p n=>5</p>
wholly contrary: for many moneths had not pa$t, before the Pil-
lar crackt, and broke in the middle ju$t upon the new Rowler.</P>
<P>SIMP. This was an accident truly $trange, and indeed <I>preter
$pem,</I> e$pecially if it were derived from the addition of new $up-
port in the middle.</P>
<P>SALV. From that doubtle$s it did proceed; and the known cau$e
of the Effect removeth the wonder: for the two pieces of the Pillar
being taken from off the Rowlers, one of tho$e bearers on which
one end of the Column had re$ted, was by length of time rotten, and
$unk away; and that in the mid$t continuing $ound, and $trong,
occa$ioned that half the Column lay hollow in the air without any
$upport at the end; $o that its own unweildy weight, made it do
that, which it would not have done, if it had re$ted only upon the
two fir$t Bearers, for as they had $hrunk away it would have fol-
lowed. And here none can think that this would have faln out in
a little Column, though of the $ame $tone, and of a length an$we-
rable to its thickne$$e, in the very $ame proportion as the thick-
ne$s, and length of the great Pillar.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am now a$$ured of the effect, but do not yet compre-
hend the cau$e, how in the augmentation of Matter, the Re$i$tance
and Strength ought not al$o to multiply at the $ame rate. And I
admire at it $o much the more, in regard I $ee, on the contrary, in
other ca$es the $trength of Re$i$tance again$t Fraction to encrea$e
much more than the enlargement of the matter encrea$eth. For if
(for example) there be two Nailes fa$tned in a Wall, the one twice
asthick as the other, that $hall bear a weight not only double to this,
but triple, and quadruple.</P>
<P>SALV. You may $ay octuple, and not be wide of the truth:
<marg><I>A Naile double
in thickne$$e to
another being fa$t-
ned in a Wall, $u-
$tains a Weight
octuple to that of
the le$$er.</I></marg>
nor is this effect contrary to the former, though in appearance it
$eemeth $o different.</P>
<P>SAGR. Therefore <I>Salviatus,</I> explain unto us the$e Riddles, and
level us the$e Rocks, if you can do it: for indeed I gue$$e this mat-
ter of Re$i$tance to be a field repleni$hed with rare, and u$eful Con-
templations, and if you be content that this be the $ubject of our
this-daies di$cour$e, it will be to me, and I believe to <I>Simplicius,</I>
very acceptable.</P>
<P>SALV. I cannot refu$e to $erve you, $ince my Memory $erveth

and indubitable fundamentals. And becau$e, as I $ay, I de$ire de-
mon$tratively to a$$ure you, and not with only probable di$cour-
$es to per$wade you; pre$uppo$ing, that you have $o much know-
ledge of the Mechanical Conclu$ions, by others heretofore funda-
mentally handled, as $ufficeth for our purpo$e; it is requi$ite, that
before we proceed any further, we con$ider what effect that is which
opperates in the Fraction of a Beam of Wood, or other Solid, who$e
parts are firmly connected; becau$e this is the fir$t <I>Notion,</I> where-
on the fir$t and $imple principle dependeth, which as familiarly
known, we may take for granted. For the clearer explanation
whereof; let us take the Cilinder, or Pri$me, <I>A. B.</I> of Wood, or
other $olid and coherent matter, fa$tned above in <I>A,</I> and hanging
perpendicular; to which, at the other end <I>B,</I> let there hang the
Weight <I>C</I>: It is manife$t, that how great $oever the Tenacity and
coherence of the parts of the $aid Solid to one another be, $o it be
not infinite, it may be overcome by the
Force of the drawing Weight C: who$e
Gravity I $uppo$e may be encrea$ed as much
<fig>
as we plea$e; by the encrea$e whereof the
$aid Solid in fine $hall break, like as if it had
been a Cord. And, as in a Cord, we under-
$tand its re$i$tance to proceed from the mul-
titude of the $trings or threads in the Hemp
that compo$e it, $o in Wood we $ee its veins,
and grain di$tended lengthwaies, that render
it far more re$i$ting again$t Fraction, then any
Rope would be, of the $ame thickne$$e: but
in a Cylinder of $tone or Metal the Tenacity
of its parts, (which yet $eemeth greater) de-
pendeth on another kind of Cement,
than of $trings, or grains, and yet they al$o
being drawn with equivalent force, break.</P>
<P>SIMP. If the thing $ucceed as you $ay, I under$tand well
enough, that the thread or grain of the Wood which is as long as
the $aid Wood may make it $trong and able to Re$i$t a great vio-
lence done to it to break it: But a Cord compo$ed of $trings of
Hemp, no longer than two, or three foot a piece, how can it be $o
$trong when it is $pun out, it may be, to a hundred times that
length? Now I would farther under$tand your opinion concern-
ing the Connection of the parts of Metals, Stones, and other mat-
ters deprived of $uch Ligatures, which neverthele$$e, if I be not
deceived, are yet more tenacious.</P>
<P>SALV. We mu$t be nece$$itated to digre$$e into new Specu-
lations, and not much to our purpo$e, if we $hould re$olve tho$e
difficulties you $tart.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>7</p>
<P>SAGR. But if Digre$$ions may lead us to the knowledge of
new Truths, what prejudice is it to us, that are not obliged to a
$trict and conci$e method, but that make our Congre$$ions only
for our diverti$ement to digre$$e $ometimes, le$t we let $lip tho$e
Notions, which perhaps the offered occa$ion being pa$t, may never
meet with another opportunity of remembrance? Nay, who knows
not, that many times curio$ity may thereby di$cover hints of more
worth, than the primarily intended Conclu$ions? Therefore I
entreat you to give $atisfaction to <I>Simplicius,</I> and my $elf al$o,
no le$$e curious than he, and de$irous to under$tand what that
Cement is, that holdeth the parts of tho$e Solids $o tenaciou$ly
conjoyned, which yet neverthele$$e in conclu$ion are di$$oluble:
a knowledge which furthermore is nece$$ary for the under$tanding
of the coherence of the parts of tho$e very ligaments, whereof
$ome Solids are compo$ed.</P>
<P>SALV. Well, $ince it is your plea$ure, I will herein $erve you.
<marg><I>What that Cement
is that Connecteth
the parts of Solids.</I></marg>
And the fir$t difficulty is, how the threads of a Cord or Rope
an hundred foot long $hould $o clo$ely connect together (none
of them exceeding two or three foot) that it requireth a great
violence to break them. But tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> cannot you hold
one $ingle $tring of Hemp $o fa$t between your fingers by one
<marg><I>How a Rope or
Cord re$i$teth Fra-
ction.</I></marg>
end, that I pulling by the other end $hould break it $ooner than
get it from you? Que$tionle$$e you might: when then, tho$e
threads are not only at the end, but al$o in every part of their
length, held fa$t with much $trength by him that gra$peth them, is
it not apparent, that it is a much harder matter to pluck them
from him that holds them, then to break them? Now in the Cord,
<marg><I>In breaking a Rope
the parts are not
$eparated, but bro-
kon.</I></marg>
the $ame act of twi$ting, binds the threads mutually within one
another, in $uch $ort, that pulling the Cord with great force, the
threads of it break in$under, but $eparate and part not from one
another; as is plainly $een by viewing the $hort ends of the $aid
threads in the broken place, that are not a $pan long; as they
would be, if the divi$ion of the Cord had been made by the $ole
$eperating of them in drawing the Cord, and not by breaking
them.</P>
<P>SAGR. For confirmation of this, let me add, that the Cord is
$ometimes $een to break, not by pulling it length-waies, but by
over-twi$ting it: an argument, in my judgment, concluding that
the threads are $o enterchangeably compre$t by one another, that
tho$e compre$$ings permit not the compre$$ed to $lip $o very little,
as is requi$ite to lengthen it out that it wind about the Cord,
which in the twining breaketh, and con$equently in $ome $inall
mea$ure $wels in thickne$$e.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ay very well; but con$ider by the way, how one
truth draweth on another. That thread, which griped between the
<foot>fingers</foot>
<p n=>8</p>
fingers, did not yield to follow him that would have forceably
drawn it from between them, re$i$ted, becau$e it was $tayed by a
double compre$$ion, $ince the upper finger pre$t no le$$e again$t
the nether, than it pre$$ed again$t that. And there is no que$tion,
that if of the$e two pre$$ures, one alone might be retained, there
would remain half of that Re$i$tance, which depended conjunctive-
ly on them both: but becau$e you cannot with removing, <I>v.g.</I> the
upper finger take away its pre$$ion, without taking away the other
part al$o; it will be nece$$ary by $ome new Artifice to retain one
of them, and to find a way that the $ame thread may compre$$e it
$elf again$t the finger or other $olid body upon which it is put; and
this is done by winding the $ame thread about the Solid. For the
better under$tanding whereof, I will briefly give it you in Figure;
and let <I>A B</I> and C<I>D</I> be two Cilinders, and between them let there
be di$tended the thread <I>E F,</I> which for greater plainne$$e I will
repre$ent to be a $mall Cord: there is no doubt but that the two
Cylinders being pre$$ed hard one again$t the other, the Cord
<I>E F</I> pulled by the end <I>F</I> will Re$i$t no $mal force before
it will $lip from between the two Solids compre$$ing it: but if
we remove one of them, though the Cord
<fig>
continue touching the other, yet $hall it not
by $uch contact be hindered from $lipping
away. But if holding it fa$t, though but
gently in the point A, towards the top of the
Cylinder, we wind, or belay it about the
$ame $pirally in A F L O T R, and pull it by
the end R: it is manife$t, that it will begin
to pre$$e the Cylinder, and if the windings
and wreathes be many, it $hall in its effectual
drawing alwaies pre$$e it $o much the $trai-
ter about the Cylinder: and by multiplying
the wreathes if you make the contact longer,
and con$equently more invincible, the more
difficult $till $hall it be to withdraw the
Cord, and make it yield to the force that
pulls it. Now who $eeth not, that the $ame
Re$i$tance is in the threads, which with many thou$and $uch
twinings $pin the thick Cord? Yea, the $tre$$e of $uch twi$ting
bindeth with $uch Tenacity, that a few Ru$hes, and of no great
length, ($o that the wreaths and windings are but few where-
with they entertwine) make very $trong bands, called, as I take it,

<P>SAGR. Your Di$cour$e hath removed the wonder out of my

<p n=>9</p>
Rope about the Axis of a Crane did not only hold it, that be-
ing drawn by the immen$e force of the weight, which it held, it
$lipt nor $hrunk not; but that moreover turning the Crane about,
the $aid Axis with the $ole touch of the Rope which begirteth it,
did in the after-turnings, draw and rai$e up va$t $tones, whil$t the
$trength of a little Boy $ufficed to hold and $tay the other end of
the $ame Cord. The other is at a plain, but cunning, In$trument found
out by a young Kin$man of mine, by which with a Cord he could
let him$elf down from a window without much gauling the palmes

a Cylinder of Wood as A B, two Inches
thick, and $ix or eight Inches long, he cut a
hollow notch $pirally, for one turn and a

half and no more, and of widene$$e fit for
the Cord he would u$e; which he made to
enter through the notch at the end A, and
to come out at the other B, incircling after-
wards the Cylinder in a barrel or $ocket of
Wood, or rather Tin, but divided length-
waies, and made with Cla$pes or Hinges to
open and $hut at plea$ure: and then gra$p-
ing and holding the $aid Barrel or Ca$e with
both his hands, the rope being made fa$t
above, he hung by his arms; and $uch was
the compre$$ion of the Cord between the
moving Socket and the Cylinder, that at
plea$ure griping his hands clo$er he could
$tay him$elf without de$cending, and $lacking his hold a little, he
could let him$elf down as he plea$ed.</P>
<P>SALV. Aningenious invention verily, and for a full explanati-

hath again$t the admi$$ion of Vacuity: for another (this of Va-

rai$ed, though it be pretty thick, and heavy, evidently proveth to
us, how much Nature abhorreth to admit, though for a $hort mo-
ment of time, the void $pace, that would be between them, till
the concour$e of the parts of the Circum-Ambient Air $hould have
po$$e$t, and repleated it. We $ee likewi$e, that if tho$e two Plates
be not exactly poli$hed, and con$equently their contact not every
where exqui$ite; in going about to $eparate them gently, there will
be found no Renitence more than that of their meer weight, but in
the $udden rai$ing, the nether Stone will ri$e, and in$tantly fall
down again, following the upper only for that very $mall time
which $erveth for the expan$ion of that little Air which interpo-
$eth betwixt the Plates, that did not every where touch, and for
the ingre$$ion of the other circumfu$ed. The like Re$i$tance, which
$o $en$ibly di$covers it $elf betwixt the two Plates, cannot be
doubted to re$ide al$o between the parts of a Solid, and that it en-
tereth into their connection, at lea$t in part, and as their Concomi-
tant Cau$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. Hold, I pray you, and permit me to impart unto you a
particular Con$ideration, ju$t now come into my Mind, and this it
is; That $eeing how the lower Plate followeth the upper, and is
by a $peedy motion rai$ed, we are thereby a$certained that (con-
trary to the $aying of many Philo$ophers, and perchance of <I>Ari-
$totle</I> him$elf) the Motion in <I>Vacuity</I> would not be In$tantaneous;
for $hould in be $uch, the propo$ed Plates without the lea$t repug-
nance would Seperate; $ince the $elf $ame in$tant of time would
$uffice for their $eparation, and for the concour$e of the Ambient
Air to repleat that <I>Vacuity,</I> which might remain between them.
By the Inferiour Plates following the Superiour therefore may be
gathered, that in the <I>Vacuity</I> the Motion would not be In$tanta-
<marg><I>Vacuity partly the

neous. And al$o it may be inferred, that even betwixt tho$e Plates
there re$teth $ome <I>Vacuity,</I> at lea$t for $ome very $hort time; that
is, for $o long as the Ambient Air is moving whil$t it concurreth to
replete the <I>Vacuum:</I> for if there did no <I>Vacuity</I> remain, there
would be no need either of the Concour$e, or Motion of the Am-
bient We mu$t therefore $ay that <I>Vacuity</I> $ometimes is admit-
ted, though by Violence or again$t Nature, (albeit it is my opi-
nion, that nothing is contrary to Nature, but that which is im-

<p n=>11</p>
po$$ible, which again never is.) But here $tarts up another diffi-
culty, and it is, That though Experience a$$ures me of the truth of
the Conclu$ion, yet my Judgment is not thorowly $atisfied of the
Cau$e, to which $uch an effect may be a$cribed. For as much as
the effect of the Seperation of the two Plates, is in time before the
Vacuity which $hould $ucceed by con$equence upon the Separa-
tion. And becau$e, in my opinion, the Cau$e ought, if not in

Time, at lea$t in Nature, to precede the Effect: and that of a Po-
$itive Effect, the Cau$e ought al$o to be Po$itive; I cannot con-
ceive, how the Cau$e of the Adhe$ion of the two Plates, and of
their Repugnance to Separation, (Effects that are already in
Act) $hould be a$$igned to Vacuity, which yet is not, but $hould
follow. And of things that are not in being, there can be no Ope-

ration; according to the infallible Maxime of Philo$ophy.</P>
<P>SIMP. But $ince you grant <I>Ari$totle</I> this Axiome, I do not
think you will deny another that is mo$t excellent, and true; to
<marg><I>Nature doth not
attempt Impo$$ibi-
lities.</I></marg>
wit, That Nature doth not attempt Impo$$ibilities: Upon which
Axiom I think the Solution of our doubt depends: becau$e there-
fore a void $pace is of it $elf impo$$ible, Nature forbids the doing
that, in con$equence of which Vacuity would nece$$arily $ucceed;
and $uch an act is the $eparation of the two Plates.</P>
<P>SAGR. Now, (admitting this which <I>Simplicius</I> alledgeth is a
$ufficient Solution of my Doubt) in per$uance of the di$cour$e
with which I began, it $eemeth to me, that this $ame Repugnance
to Vacuity $hould be a $ufficient Cement in the parts of a Solid of
Stone, Metal, or what other $ub$tance is more firmly conjoyned,
and aver$e to Divi$ion. For if a $ingle Effect, hath but one $ole
Cau$e, as I under$tand, and think; or if many be a$$igned, they
are reducible to one alone: why $hould not this of Vacuity, which
certainly is one, be $ufficient to an$wer all Re$i$tances?</P>
<P>SALV. I will not at this time enter upon this conte$t, whether
Vacuity, without other Cement, be in it $elf alone $ufficient to
keep together the $eparable parts of firm Bodies; but yet this I
$ay, that the Rea$on of the Vacuity, which is of force, and con-
oluding in the two Plates, $ufficeth not of it $elf alone for the
firm connection of the parts of a $olid Cylinder of Marble, or
Metal, the which forced with great violence, pulling them $treight
out, in fine, divide and $eparate. And in ca$e I have found a way
to di$tingui$h this already-known Re$i$tance dependent on Va-
ouity, from all others what$oever that may concur with it in
$trengthening the Connection, and make you $ee how that it alone
is not neer $ufficient for $uch an Effect, would not you grant that
it would be nece$$ary to introduce $ome other? Help him out, <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> for he $tands $tudying what to an$wer.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Su$pen$ion of <I>Sagredus</I> mu$t needs be upon ano-

nece$$ary a Con$equence.</P>
<P>SAGR. You Divine <I>Simplicius,</I> I was thinking if a Million of
Gold <I>per annum,</I> coming from <I>Spaine,</I> not being $ufficient to pay
the Army, whether it was nece$$ary to make any other provi$ion
than of Money to pay the Souldiers. But proceed, <I>Salviatus,</I> and
$uppo$ing that I admit of your Con$equence, $hew us how to $e-
parate the opperation of Vacuity from the other, that mea$uring
it we may $ee how it's in$ufficient for the Effect of which we $peak.</P>
<P>SALV. Your Genius hath prompted you. Well, I will tell you
the way to part the Virtue of Vacuity from the re$t, and then how
to mea$ure it. And to $ever it, we will take a continuate matter,
<marg><I>How to mea$ure
the Virtue of Va-
cuity in Solids di-
$tinct from other
convenient Cau$es
of their Coherence.
Water a Continu-
ate Matter, and
void of all other a-
ver$ion to $eparati-
on, $ave that of Va-
cuity.</I></marg>
who$e parts are de$titute of all other Re$i$tance to Separation, $ave
only that of Vacuity, $uch as Water at large hath been demon-
$trated to be in a certain Tractate of our <I>Accademick.</I> So that
when ever a Cylinder of Water is $o di$po$ed, that being drawn
we find a Re$i$tance again$t the $eparation of its parts, this mu$t
be acknowledged to proceed from no other cau$e, but from re-
pugnance to Vacuity. But to make $uch an experiment, I have
imagined a device, which with the help of a $mall Diagram, may
be better expre$t than by my bare words. Let this Figure C A B D
be the Profile of a Cylinder of Metal, or of Gla$s, which mu$t
be made hollow within, but turned exactly round; into who$e
Concave mu$t enter a Cylinder of Wood, exqui$itely fitted to
touch every where, who$e Profile is noted by
E G H F, which Cylinder may be thru$t up-
<fig>
wards, and downwards: and this I would
have bored in the middle, $o that there may
a rod of Iron pa$s thorow, hooked in the end
K, and the other end I, $hall grow thicker in
fa$hion of a Cone, or Top; and let the
hole made for the $ame thorow the Cylinder
of Wood be al$o cut hollow in the upper
part, like a Conical Superficies, and exactly
fitted to receive the Conick end I, of the
Iron I K, as oft as it is drawn down by the
part K. Then I put the Cylinder of Wood
E H into the Concave Cylinder A D, and
would not have it come to touch the upper-
mo$t Superficies of the $aid hollow Cylinder,
but that it $tay two or three fingers breadth
from it: and I would have that $pace filled with Water; which
$hould be put therein, holding the Ve$$el with the mouth C D up-
wards; and thereupon pre$s down the Stopper E H, holding the
Conical part I $omewhat di$tant from the hollow that was made
<foot>for</foot>
<p n=>13</p>
for it in the Wood, to leave way for the Air to go out, which in
thru$ting down the Stopper will i$$ue out by the hole of the
Wood, which therefore $hould be made a little wider than the
thickne$s of the Hook of Iron I K. The Air being let out, and the
Iron pull'd back, which clo$e $toppeth the wood with its Conick
part I, then turn the ve$$el with its mouth downwards, and fa$ten to
the hook K a Bucket that may receive into it $and, or other weigh-
ty matter, and you may hang $o much weight thereat, that at length
the Superiour $urface of the Stopper E F will $eparate and for$ake
the inferiour part of the Water; to which nothing el$e held it con-
nected but the Repugnance again$t Vacuity: afterwards weighing
the Stopper with the Iron, the Bucket, and all that was in it, you
will have the quantity of the Force of the Vacuity. And if affixing
to a Cylinder of Marble, or Chri$tal, as thick as the Cylinder of
Water, $uch a weight, that together with the proper weight of the
Marble or Chri$tal it $elf, equalleth the gravity of all tho$e fore-
named things, a Rupture follow thereupon; we may without
doubt affirm, that the only rea$on of Vacuity holdeth the parts of
Marble and Chri$tal conjoyned: but not $ufficing; and $eeing
that to break it there mu$t be added four times as much weight,
it mu$t be confe$$ed, that the Re$i$tance of Vacuity is one part of
$ive, and that the other Re$i$tance is quadruple to that of Vacuity.</P>
<P>SIMP. It cannot be denied, but that the Invention is Ingen-
ous: but I hold it to be $ubject to many difficulties, which makes
me que$tion it; for who $hall a$$ure us, that the Air cannot pene-
trate between the Gla$s, and the Stopper, though it be clo$e $topt
with Flax, or other pliant matter? And al$o it's a Que$tion, whe-
ther Wax or Turpentine will $erve to make the Cone I, $top the
hole clo$e: Again, Why may not the parts of the Water with-
draw and rarefie them$elves? Why may not the Air, or Exhalati-
ons, or other more $ubtil Sub$tances penetrate through the Poro$i-
ties of the Wood, or Gla$s it $elf?</P>
<P>SALV. <I>Simplicius</I> is very nimble at rai$ing doubts, and, in part,
helping us to re$olve them, as to the Penetration of the Air through
the Wood, or between the Wood and Gla$s. But I moreover
ob$erve, that we may at the $ame time $ecure our $elves, and with-
all acquire new Notions, if the fore-named doubts take place; for
if the Water be by Nature, howbeit with violence, capable of ex-
tention, as it falleth out in Air, you $hall $ee the Stopper to de-
$cend: and if in the upper part of the Gla$s we make a $mall pro-
minent Bo$s, as this V; in ca$e any Air, or other more Tenuous or
Spirituous Matter $hould penetrate thorow the Sub$tance, or Poro$i-
ty of the Gla$s, or Wood, it would be $een to reunite (the water
giving place) in the eminence V: which things not being percei-
ved, we re$t a$$ured that the Experiment was made with due
<foot>caution:</foot>
<p n=>14</p>
caution: and $ee that the Water is not capable o$ exten$ion, nor
the Gla$s permeable by any matter, though never $o $ubtil.</P>
<P>SAGR. And I, by means of the$e Di$cour$es have found the
Cau$e of an Effect, that hath for a long time puzled my mind
<marg><I>The Nature of the
attraction of Wa-
ter by Pumps.</I></marg>
with wonder, and kept it in Ignorance. I have heretofore ob-
$erved a Ci$tern, wherein, for the drawing thence of Water, there
was made a Pump, by $ome one that thought, perhaps, (but in
vain) to be thereby able to draw, with le$s labour, the $ame, or
greater quantity of Water, than with the ordinary Buckets; and
this Pump had its Sucker and Value on high, $o that the Water
was made to a$cend by Attraction, and not by Impul$e, as do the
Pumps that work below. This, whil$t there is any Water in the
Ci$tern to $uch a determinate height, will draw it plentifully; but
when the Water ebbeth below a certain Mark, the Pump will
work no more. I conceited, the fir$t time that I ob$erved this ac-
cident, that the Engine ____ had been $poyled, and looking for
the Workman, that he might amend it; he told me, that there was
no defect at all, other than what was in the Water, which being
fallen too low, permitted not it $elf to be rai$ed to $uch a height;
<marg><I>Water rai$ed or at-
tracted by a Pump
ri$eth not above
eleven yards.</I></marg>
and farther $aid, that neither Pump, or other Machine, that rai$eth
the water by Attraction, was po$$ibly able to make it ri$e a hair
more than eighteen Braces, and be the Pumps wide or narrow, this
is the utmo$t limited mea$ure of their height. And I have hitherto
been $o dull of apprehen$ion, that though I knew that a Rope, a
Stick, and a Rod of Iron might be $o and $o lengthened, that at
la$t, holding it up on high in the Air, its own weight would break
it, yet I never remembred, that the $ame would much more ea$ily
happen in a Rope, or Thread of Water. And what other is that
which is attracted in the Pump than a Cylinder of Water, which
having its contraction above, prolonged more and more, in the end
arriveth to that term, beyond which being drawn, it breaketh by
its foregoing over-weight, ju$t as if it was a Rope.</P>
<P>SALV. It is even $o as you $ay; and becau$e the $aid height of
eighteen Braces is the prefixed term of the Elevation, to which any
quantity of Water, be it (that is to $ay, be the Pump) broad,
narrow, or even, $o narrow as to the thickne$s of a $traw, can $u-
$tain it $elf; when ever we weigh the water contained in eighteen
Braces of Pipe, be it broad or narrow, we have the value of Re$i-
$tance of Vacuity in Cylinders of what$oever $olid matter, of the
thickne$s of the propo$ed Pipes. And $ince I have $aid $o much,
<marg><I>To what length Cy-
linders or Ropes of
any Matter may
be prolonged, be-
yond which being
charged they break
by their own weight</I></marg>
we will $hew, that a man may ea$ily find in all Metals, Stones, Tim-
bers, Gla$$es, <I>&amp;c.</I> How far one may lengthen out Cylinders,
$trings, or rods of any thickne$s, beyond which, being oppre$t with
their own weight, they can no longer hold, but break in pieces.
Take for example a Bra$s wyer of any certain thickne$s, and length,
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>15</p>
and fixing one of its ends on high, add gradually more and more
weight to the other, till at la$t it break, and let the greate$t weight
that it can bear be <I>v. gr.</I> fifty pounds. It is manife$t that fifty
pound of Bra$s more than its own weight, which let us $uppo$e,
for example, to be one eighth of an Ounce, drawn out into a
Wyer of the like thickne$s, would be the greate$t length of the
Wyer that could bear it $elf. Then mea$ure how long the Wyer
was which brake, and let it be for in$tance a y ard; and becau$e it
weighed one eighth of an Ounce; and poi$ed, or bore it $elf, and
fifty pounds more; which are Four Thou$and Eight Hundred
eighths of Ounces; we $ay, that all Wyers of Bra$s, whatever
thickne$s they be of, can hold, at the length of Four Thou$and
Eight Hundred and one yards, and no more: and $o, a Bra$s Wyer
being able to hold to the length of 4801 yards; the Re$i$tance it
findeth dependent on Vacuity, in re$pect of the remainder, is as
much as is equivalent to the weight of a Rope of Water eighteen
Braces long, and of the $ame thickne$s with the $aid Bra$s Wyer:
and finding Bra$s to be <I>v. gr.</I> nine times heavier than Water, in
any Wyer of Bra$s, the Re$i$tance again$t Fraction dependent on
the rea$on of Vacuity, importeth as much as two Braces of the
$ame Wyer weigheth. And thus arguing, and operating, we may
find the length of the Wyers, or Threads of all Solid Matters re-
duced to the utmo$t length that they can $ub$i$t of, and al$o what
part Vacuity hath in their Re$i$tance.</P>
<P>SAGR. It re$teth now, that you declare to us wherein con$i$ts
the remainder of that Tenacity, that is, what that Glue or Reni-
tence is, which connecteth together the parts of a Solid, be$ides
that which is derived from Vacuity; becau$e I cannot imagine
what that Cement is, that cannot be burnt, or con$umed in a ve-
ry hot Furnace in two, three, or four Moneths, nor ten, nor an hun-
dred; and yet Gold, Silver, and Gla$s, $tanding $o long Liqui$i-
ed, when it is taken out, its parts return, upon cooling, to reunite,
and conjoyn, as before. And again, becau$e the $ame difficulty
which I meet within the Connection of the parts of the Gla$s, I
find al$o in the parts of the Cement, that is, what thing that
$hould be which maketh them cleave $o clo$s together.</P>
<P>SALV. I told you but even now, that your Genius prompted
you: I am al$o in the $ame $trait: and al$o whereas I have in gene-
ral told you, how that Repugnance again$t Vacuity is unque$ti-
onably that which permits not, nnle$s with great violence, the $e-
paration of the two Plates, and moreover of the two great pieces of
the Pillar of Marble, or Bra$s, I cannot $ee why it $hould not al$o
take place, and be likewi$e the Cau$e of the Coherence of the le$-
$er parts, and even of the very lea$t and la$t, of the $ame Matters:
<marg><I>There is but one
$ole Cau$e of one
$ole Effect.</I></marg>
and being that of one $ole Effect, there is but one only true, and
<foot>mo$t</foot>
<p n=>16</p>
mo$t potent Cau$e; if I can find no other Cement, why may I not
try whether this of Vacuity, which I have already found, may be
$ufficient?</P>
<P>SIMP. But when you have already demon$trated the Re$i-
$tance of the great Vacuity in the $eparation of the two great
parts of a Solid to be very $mall in compari$on of that which con-
necteth, and con$olidates the little Particles, or Atomes, why will
you not $till hold, for certain, that this is extreamly differing from
that?</P>
<P>SALV. To this <I>Sagredus</I> an$wereth, That every particular
Souldier is $till paid with money collected by the general Impo$i-
tions of Shillings and Pence, although a Million of Gold $ufficeth
not to pay the whole Army. And who knows, but that other ex-
ceeding $mall Vacuities may operate among$t tho$e $mall Atomes,
(even like as that was of the $elf-$ame money) wherewith all
the parts are connected? I will tell you what I have $ometimes
fancied: and I give it you, not as an unque$tionable Truth, but as a
kind of Conjecture very undige$ted, $ubmitting it to exacter con-
$iderations: Pick out of it what plea$eth you, and judge of the re$t
<marg><I>Mo$t $mall Va-

cles to one another,</I></marg>
as you think fit. Con$idering $ometimes how the Fire, penetra-
ting and in$inuating between the $mall Atomes of this or that Me-
tal, which were before $o clo$ely con$olidated, in the end $epa-
rates, and di$unites them; and how, the Fire being gone, they re-
turn with the $ame Tenacity as before to Con$olidation, without
dimini$hing in quantity, (at all in Gold, and very little in other
Metals,) though they continue a long time melted; I have thought
that that might happen, by rea$on the extream $mall parts of the
Fire, penetrating through the narrow pores of the Metal (through
which the lea$t parts of Air, or of many other Fluids, could not
for their clo$ene$s perforate) by repleating the $mall interpo$ing
Vacuities might free the minute parts of the $ame from the vio-
lence, wherewith the $aid Vacuities attract them one to another,
prohibiting their $eparation: and thus becoming able to move
freely, their Ma$s might become fluid, and continue $uch, as long
as the $mall parts of the Fire $hould abide betwixt them: and that
tho$e departing, and leaving the former Vacuities, their wonted
attractions might return, and con$equently the Cohe$ion of the
parts. And, as to the Allegation made by <I>Simplicius,</I> it may, in
my opinion, be thus re$olved; That although $uch Vacuities $hould
be very $mall, and con$equently each of them ea$ie to be over-
come, yet neverthele$s their innumerable multitude innumerably
<marg><I>Innumerable A-
tomes of Water in-
$inuating into Ca-

an immen$e weight</I></marg>
(if it be proper $o to $peak) multiplieth the Re$i$tances: and we
have an evident proof what, and how great is the Force that re$ul-
teth from the conjunction of an immen$e number of very weak
Moments, in $eeing a Weight of many thou$ands of pounds, held
<foot>by</foot>
<p n=>17</p>
by mighty Cables, to yield, and $uffer it $elf at la$t to be over-
come by the a$$ault of the innumerable Atomes of Water; which,
either carryed by the South-wind, or el$e by being di$tended into
very thin Mi$ts that move to and fro in the Air, in$inuate them-
$elves between $tring and $tring of the Hemp of the harde$t twi-
$ted Cables; nor can the immen$e force of the pendent Weight
prohibit their enterance; $o that perforating the $trict pa$$ages be-
tween the Pores, they $well the Ropes, and by con$equence $hor-
ten them, whereupon that huge Ma$s is forcibly rai$ed.</P>

infinite, it may by a multitude of mo$t minute Forces be over-

be able to carry to $hore a whole $hips lading of Corn: for Sen$e
giveth us quotidian examples, that an Ant carrieth a $ingle grain
with ea$e; and its cleer, that in the Ship there are not infinite
grains, but that they are compri$ed in a certain number; and if you
take another number four or $ix times bigger than that, and take
al$o another of Ants equal to it, and $et them to work, they $hall
carry the Corn, and the Ship al$o. It is true indeed, that it will be
needful that the number be great, as al$o in my judgment that of
the <I>Vacuities,</I> which hold together the $inall parts of the

<I>Mon$ig. di Guevara</I> very acutely di$cu$$eth. But it is fir$t requi$ite
to declare a Propo$ition not toucht by others, on which the $olution
of the que$tion dependeth, which afterwards, if I deceive not my
$elf, will draw along with it other new and admirable Notions; for
under$tanding whereof the more exactly, we will give it you in
a Scheme: We $uppo$e, therefore an equilateral, and equian-
gled Poligon of any number of Sides at plea$ure, de$cribed
about this Center G; and in this example let it be a Hexagon
A B C D E F; like to which, and concentrick with the $ame
mu$t be di$tributed another le$$er, which we mark H I K L M N;
<foot>D and</foot>
<p n=>18</p>
and let one Side of the greater A B be prolonged indeterminately
towards S, and of the le$$e the corre$pondent Side H I is to be
produced in like manner towards the $ame part, repre$enting the
Line H T, parallel to A S; and let another pa$$e by the Center
equidi$tant from the former, namely G V. This done, we $uppo$e
the greater Poligon to turn about upon the Line A S, carrying
with it the other le$$er Poligon. It is manife$t, that the point B,
the term of the Side A B, $tanding $till, whil$t the Revolution
begins, the angle A ri$eth, and the point C de$cendeth, de$cribing
the arch C Q; $o that the Side B C is applyed to the line B Q,
equal to it $elf: but in $uch conver$ion the angle I of the le$$er
Poligon ri$eth above the Line I T. for that I B is oblique upon
A S: nor will the point I fall upon the parallel I T, before the
point C come to Q: and by that time I $hall be de$cended unto
O after it had de$cribed the Arch I O, without the Line H T: and
at the $ame time the Side I K $hall have pa$s'd to O P. But the Cen-
ter G $hall have gone all this time out of the Line G V, on which it
$hal not fall, until it $hall fir$t have de$cribed the Arch G C. Having
made this fir$t $tep, the greater Poligon $hall be tran$po$ed to re$t
with the Side B C upon the Line B Q; the Side I K of the le$$er
upon the Line O P, having skipt all the Line I O without touching
<fig>
it; and the Center G $hall be removed to C, making its whole
cour$e without the Parallel G V: And in fine all the Figure $hall
be remitted into a Po$ition like the fir$t; $o that the Revolution
being continued, and coming to the $econd $tep, the Side of the
greater Poligon D C $hall remove to Q X; K L of the le$$er (ha-
ving fir$t skipt the Arch P Y) $hall fall upon Y Z, and the Center
proceeding evermore without G V $hall fall on it in R, after the
great skip C R. And in the la$t place, having fini$hed an entire
Conver$ion, the greater Poligon will have impre$$ed upon A S, $ix
<foot>Lines</foot>
<p n=>19</p>
Lines equal to its Perimeter without any interpo$itions or skips:
the le$$er Poligon likewi$e $hall have traced $ix Lines equal to its
Perimeter, but di$continued by the interpo$ition of five Arches,
under which are the Chords, parts of the parallel H T not toucht
by the Poligon: And la$tly, the Center G never hath toucht the
Parallel G V except in $ix points. From hence you may compre-
hend, how that the Space pa$$ed by the le$$er Poligon, is almo$t
equal to that pa$$ed by the greater, that is the Line H T is almo$t
equal to A S, then which it is le$$er only the quantity of one of
the$e Arches, taking the Line H T, together with all its Arches.
Now, this which I have declared and explained to you in the exam-
ple of the$e Hexagons, I would have you under$tand to hold true
in all other Poligons, of what number of Sides $oever they be, $o
that they be like Concentrick, and Conjoyned; and that at the
Conver$ion of the greater, the other, how much $oever le$$er, be
$uppo$ed to revolve therewith: that is, you mu$t under$tand, I $ay,
that the Lines by them pa$$ed are very near equal, computing in-
to the Space pa$t by the le$$er, the Intervals under the little Ar-
ches not toucht by any part of the Perimeter of the $aid le$$er Po-
ligon. Let therefore the greater Poligon, of a thou$and Sides, pa$s
round, and mea$ure out a continued Line equal to its Perimeter;
and in the $ame time the le$s pa$$eth a Line almo$t as long, but
compounded of a thou$and Particles equal to its thou$and Sides,
but di$continued with the interpo$ition of a thou$and void Spaces:
for $uch may we call them, in relation to the thou$and little Lines
toucht by the Sides of the Poligon. And what hath been $poken
hitherto admits of no doubt or $cruple. But tell me, in ca$e that
about a Center, as $uppo$e the point A, (in the former Scheme)
we $hould de$cribe two Circles concentrick, and united together;
and that from the points C and B of their Semi-Diameters, there
be drawn the Tangents C E, and B F, and by the Center A the Pa-
rallel A D; $uppo$ing the greater Circle to be turned upon the
Line B F, (drawn equal to its Circumference, as likewi$e the other
two C E, and A D;) when it hath compleated one Revolution,
what $hall the le$$er Circle, and Center have done? The Center
$hall doubtle$s have run over, and touched the whole Line A D,
and the le$s Circumference $hall with its touches have mea$ured
all C E, doing the $ame as did the Poligons above; and different
only in this, that the Line H T was not touched in all its Parts by
the Perimeter of the le$$er Poligon, but there were as many parts
left untoucht with the interpo$ition of $alts, or skipped $paces; as
were the$e parts touched by the Sides: but here in the Circles,
the Circumference of the le$$er Circle, never $eparates from the
Line C E, $o as to leave any of its parts untou cht; nor is the parts
touching of the Circumference, le$s than the part toucht of the
<foot>D 2 Right-</foot>
<p n=>20</p>
Right-line. Now how is it po$$ible that the le$$er Circle $hould
without skips run a Line $o much bigger than its Circumfe-
rence?</P>
<P>SAGR. I was con$idering whether one might not $ay, that like
as the Center of the Circle trailed alone upon A D toucht, it all
being yet but one $ole Point; $o likewi$e might the Points of the
le$$er Circumference, drawn by the revolution of the greater, go
gliding along $ome $mall part of the Line C E.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. This cannot be, for two rea$ons; fir$t, becau$e there is
no rea$on why $ome of the touches like to C $hould go gliding
along $ome part of the Line C E, more than others: and though
there $hould; $uch touches being (becau$e they are points) in$i-
nite, the glidings along upon C E would be infinite; and $o being,
they would make an infinite Line, but the Line C E is finite. The
other rea$on is, that the greater Circle, in its Revolution continu-
ally changing contact, the le$$er Circle mu$t of nece$$ity do the
like; there being no other Point but B, by which a Right Line can
be drawn to the Center A, and pa$$ing through C; $o that the
greater Circumference changing Contact, the le$s doth change it
al$o; nor doth any Point of the le$s touch more than one Point of
its Right-Line C E: be$ides, that al$o in the conver$ion of the Po-
ligons, no Point of the Perimeter of the le$s falls on more than one
Point of the Line, which was by the $aid Perimeter traced, as may
be ea$ily under$tood, con$idering the Line I K is parallel to B C,
whereupon, till ju$t that B C fall on B R, I K continueth elevated
above I P, and toucheth it not before B C is on the very Point of
uniting with B Q, and then all in the $ame in$tant I K uniteth
with O P, and afterwards immediately ri$eth above it again.</P>
<P>SAGR. The bu$ine$s is really very intricate, nor can I think on
any Solution of it, therefore do you explain it to us as far as you
judge needful.</P>
<P>SALV. I $hould, for the evincing hereof, have recour$e to the
con$ideration of the fore-de$cribed Poligons, the effect of which is
intelligible and already comprehended, and would $ay, that like as
in the Poligons of an hundred thou$and Sides, the Line pa$$ed and
mea$ured by the Perimeter of the greater, that is by its hundred
thou$and Sides continually di$tended, is not con$iderably bigger
than that mea$ured by the hundred thou$and Sides of the le$s, but
with the interpo$ition of an hundred thou$and void $paces interve-
ning; fo I would $ay in the Circles (which are Poligons of innu-
merable Sides) that the Line mea$ured by the infinite Sides of the
great Circle, lying continued one with another, to be equalled in
length by the Line traced by the infinite Sides of the le$s, but by
the$e including the interpo$ition of the like number of intervening
Spaces: and like as the Sides are not quantitative, but yet infinite
<foot>in</foot>
<p n=>21</p>
in number, $o the interpo$ing Vacuitics are not quantitative, but
infinite in number; that is, tho$e are infinite Points all filled, and
the$e are infinite points, part filled, and part empty. And here I
would have you note, that re$olving, and dividing a Line into quan-
titative parts, and con$equently of a finite number, it is not po$$ible
to di$po$e them into a greater extention than that which they po$-
$e$t whil$t they were continued, and connected, without the inter-
po$ition of a like number of void Spaces; but imagining it to be
re$olved into parts not quantitative, namely, into its infinite indivi-
$ibles, we may conceive it produced to immen$ity without the in-
terpo$ition of quantitative void $paces, but yet of infinite indivi$i-
ble Vacuities. And this which is $poken of $imple lines, $hould al$o
be under$tood of Superficies, and Solid Bodies, con$idering that they
are compo$ed of infinite Atomes not non-quantitative; if we would
divide them into certain quantitative parts, there's no que$tion, but
that we cannot di$po$e them into Spaces more ample than the Solid
before occupied, unle$s with the interpo$ition of a certain number
of quantitative void Spaces; void, I $ay, at lea$t of the matter of the
Solid: but if we $hould propo$e the highe$t, and ultimate re$olution
made into the fir$t, non-quantitative, but infinite fir$t compoun-
ding parts, we may be able to conceive $uch compounding parts
extended unto an immen$e Space without the interpo$ition of
quantitative void Spaces; but only of infinite non-quantitative Va-
cuities: and in this manner a man may draw out, <I>v. gr.</I> a little Ball
of Gold into a very va$t expan$ion without admitting any quan-
titative void Spaces; yet neverthele$s we may admit the Gold to
be compounded of infinite induci$$ible ones.</P>

C E, and B F, this taken continually, and that, with the interpo$i-
tion of infinite void Points; how can A D, de$cribed by the Center,
which is but one $ole Point, be $aid to be equal to the $ame, it con-
taining infinite of them? Again, that $ame compo$ing the Line of
<foot>Points,</foot>
<p n=>22</p>

no le$s puzleth me than tho$e difficulties them$elves.</P>

is equal to a Line; in regard I can do no more for the pre$ent, I
will attempt to $atisfie, or, at lea$t, qualifie one improbability with
another like it, or greater; as $ome times a Wonder is $wallowed

placed upon tho$e Superficies as their Ba$es; and that go (both

mine their perpetual precedent equalities, one of the Solids with
one of the Superficies in a very long Line; and the other Solid
with the other Superficies in a $ingle Point: that is, the latter in
one Point alone, the other in infinite.</P>
<P><I>S</I>AGR. An admirable propo$al, really, yet let us hear you ex-
plain and demon$trate it.</P>
<P>SALV. It is nece$$ary to give you it in Figure, becau$e the proof
is purely Geometrical. Therefore $uppo$e the Semicircle A F B,
and its Center to be C, and about it de$cribe the Rectangle
A D E B, and from the Center unto the Points D and E let there
be drawn the Lines C D, and C E; Then drawing the Semi-Dia-
<foot>meter</foot>
<p n=>23</p>
meter C F, perpendicular to one of the two Lines A B, or D E
and immoveable; we $uppo$e all this Figure to turn round about
that Perpendicular: It is manife$t, that there will be de$cribed by
the Parallelogram A D E B, a Cylinder; by the Semi-circle A F B,
an Hemi-Sph&aelig;re; and by the Triangle C D E a Cone. This pre-
$uppo$ed, I would have you imagine the Hemi$ph&aelig;re to be taken
away, leaving behind the Cone, and that which $hall remain of
the Cylinder; which for the Figure, which it $hall retain like to a
Di$h, we will hereafter call a Di$h: touching which, and the
Cone, we will $ir$t demon$trate that they are equal; and next
a Plain being drawn parallel to the Circle, which is the foot or
Ba$e of the Di$h, who$e Diameter is the Line D E, and its Center
F; we will demon$trate, that $hould the $aid Plain pa$s, <I>v. gr.</I> by
the Line G H, cutting the Di$h in the points G I, and O N; and
the Cone in the points H and L; it would cut the part of the
Cone C H L, equal alwaies to the part of the Di$h, who$e Profile
is repre$ented to us by the Triangles G A I, and B O N: and more-
over we will prove the Ba$e al$o of the $ame Cone, (that is the
Circle, who$e Diameter is H L) to be equal to that circular Su-
perficies, which is Ba$e of the part of the Di$h; which is, as we
may $ay, a Rimme as broad as G I; (note here by the way what
Mathematical Definitions are: they be an impo$ition of names, or,
we may $ay, abreviations of $peech, ordain'd and introduced to
prevent the trouble and pains, which you and I meet with, at pre-
$ent, in that we have not agreed together to call <I>v. gr.</I> this Super-
ficies a circular Rimme, and that very $harp Solid of the Di$h a
round Razor:) now how$oever you plea$e to call them, it $ufficeth
you to know, that the Plain produced to any di$tance at plea$ure,
$o that it be parallel to the Ba$e, <I>viz.</I> to the Circle who$e Diame-
ter D E cuts alwaies the two Solids, namely, the part of the Cone
C H L, and the upper part of the Di$h equal to one another: and
likewi$e the two Superficies, Ba$is of the $aid Solids, <I>viz.</I> the $aid
Rimme, and the Circle H L, equal al$o to one another. Whence
followeth the forementioned Wonder; namely, that if we $hould
$uppo$e the cutting-plain to be
$ucce$$ively rai$ed towards the
<fig>
Line A B, the parts of the Solid
cut are alwaies equall, as al$o the
Superficies, that are their Ba$es,
are evermore equal; and, in
fine, rai$ing the $aid Plain higher
and higher, the two Solids (ever
equal) as al$o their Ba$es, (Su-
perficies ever equal) $hall one couple of them terminate in a Cir-
cumference of a Circle, and the other couple in one $ole point;
<foot>for</foot>
<p n=>24</p>
for $uch are the upper Verge or Rim of the Di$h, and the Vertex
of the Cone. Now whil$t that in the diminution of the two So-
lids, they till the very la$t maintain their equality to one another, it
is, in my thoughts, proper to $ay, that the highe$t and ultimate terms
of $uch Diminutions are equal, and not one infinitely bigger than
the other. It $eemeth therefore, that the Circumference of an im-
men$e Circle may be $aid to be equal to one $ingle point; and
this that befalls in Solids, holdeth likewi$e in the Superficies their
Ba$es; that they al$o in the common Diminution con$erving al-
waies equality, in fine, determine at the in$tant of their ultimate
Diminution the one, (that is, that of the Di$h) in their Circum-
ference of a Circle, the other (to wit, that of the Cone) in one
$ole point. And why may not the$e be called equal, if they be the
la$t remainders, and foot$teps left by equal Magnitudes? And note
again, that were $uch Ve$$els capable of the immen$e C&oelig;le$tial
Hemi$pheres: both their upper Rims, and the points of the contai-
ned Cones (keeping evermore equally to one another) would fi-
nally determine, tho$e, in Circumferences equal to tho$e of the
greate$t Circles of the C&oelig;le$tial Orbes, and the$e in $implo points.
Whence, according to that which $uch Speculations per$wade us
to, all Circumferences of Circles, how unequal $oever, may be
$aid to be equal to one another, and each of them equal to one $ole
point.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Speculation is, in my e$teem, $o quaint and curi-
ous, that, for my part, though I could, yet would I not oppo$e it,
for I take it for a piece of Sacriledge to deface $o fine a Structure,
by $purning at it with any pedantick contradiction; yet for our en-
tire $ati<*>faction, give us the proof (which you $ay is Geometrical)
of the equality alwaies retained between tho$e Solids, and tho$e
their Ba$es, which I think mu$t needs be very $ubtil, the philo$o-
phical Contemplation being $o nice, which depends on the $aid
Conclu$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. The Demon$tration is but $hort, and ea$ie. Let us keep
to the former Figure, in which the Angle I P C being a Right An-
gle, the Square of the Semi-Diameter I C is equal to the two
Squares of the Sides I P, and P C. But the Semi-Diameter I C, is
equal to A C, and this to G P; and C P is equal to P H; therefore
the Square of the Line G P is equal to the two Squares of I P, and
P H, and the Quadruple to the Quadruples; that is, the Quadrate
of the Diameter G N is equal to the two Quadrates I O, and H L:
and becau$e Circles are to each other, as the Squares of their Dia-
meters; the Circle who$e Diameter is G N, $hall be equall to the
two Circles who$e Diameters are I O, and H L; and taking away
the Common Circle, who$e Diameter is I O; the re$idue of the
Circle G N $hall be equal to the Circle, who$e Diameter is H L.
<foot>And</foot>

And this is as to the fir$t part: Now as for the other part, we will,
for the pre$ent, omit its Demon$tration, as well becau$e that if you
would $ee it, you $hall find it in the twelfth Propo$ition of the Se-

Lucas Valerius,</I> the new <I>Archimedes</I> of our Age; who upon ano-
ther occa$ion hath made u$e of it; as becau$e in our ca$e it $uffi-
ceth to have $een, how the Superficies, already explained, are ever-
more equal; and that alwaies dimini$hing equally, they in the end
determine, one in a $ingle point, and the other in the Circumfe-
rence of a Circle, be it never-$omuch bigger, for in this lyeth our
Wonder.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Demon$tration is as ingenious, as the reflection
grounded upon it is admirable. Now let us hear $omewhat about
the other Doubt $ugge$ted by <I>Simplicius,</I> if you have any particu-
lars worth note to hint thereupon, but I $hould incline to think it
impo$$ible to be, in regard it is a Controver$ie that hath been $o
canva$$ed.</P>
<P>SALV. You $hall have $ome of my particular thoughts thereon;
fir$t repeating what but even now I told you, namely, that Infini-
ty alone, as al$o Indivi$ibility, are things incompre hen$ible to us:
now think how they will be conjoyned together: and yet if you
would compound the Line of indivi$ible points, you mu$t make
them infinite; and thus it will be requi$ite to apprehend in the
$ame in$tant both Infinite, and Indivi$ible. The things that ar $e-
veral times have come into my mind, on this occa$ion, are many;
part whereof, and the more con$iderable, it may be, I cannot upon
$uch a $udden remember; but it may happen, that in the $equal
of the Di$cour$e, coming to put que$tions and doubts to you, and
particularly to <I>Simplicius,</I> they may, on the other $ide, re-mind
me of that, which without $uch excitement would have lain dor-
mant in my Fancy: and therefore, with my wonted freedom, per-
mit me that I produce any wild conjectures, for $uch may we fitly
call them in compari$on of $upernatural Doctrines, the only true
and certain determiners of our Controver$ies, and unerring guides
in our ob$cure, and dubious paths, or rather Laberinths.</P>
<P>Among$t the fir$t In$tances that are wont to be produced
<marg>Continuum <I>com-
pounded of Indivi-

again$t tho$e that compound <I>Continuum</I> of Indivi$ibles, this is u$u-
ally one; That an Indivi$ible, added to another Indivi$ible, produ-
ceth not a thing divi$ible; for if that were $o, it would follow, that
even the Indivi$ibles were divi$ible: for if two Indivi$ibles, as for
example, two Points conjoyned, $hould make a Quantity that
$hould be a divi$ible Line, much more $uch $hould one be that is
compounded of three, five, $even, or others, that are odd num-
bers; the which Lines, being to be cut in two equal parts, render
divi$ible that Indivi$ible which was placed in the middle. In this
<foot>E and</foot>
<p n=>26</p>
and other Objections of this kind you may $atisfie the propo$er of
them, telling him, that neither two Indivi$ibles, nor ten, nor an
hundred, no, nor a thou$and can compound a Magnitude divi$ible,
and quantitative, but being infinite they may.</P>
<P>SIMP. Here already ri$eth a doubt, which I think unre$olvable;
and it is, that we being certain to find Lines one bigger than ano-
ther, although both contain infinite Points, we mu$t of nece$$ity
confe$s, that we have found in the $ame Species a thing bigger than
infinite; becau$e the Infinity of the Points of the greater Line, $hall
exceed the Infinity of the Points of the le$$er. Now this a$$igning
of an Infinite bigger than an Infinite is, in my opinion, a conceit
that can never by any means be apprehended.</P>
<P>SALV. The$e are $ome of tho$e difficulties, which re$ult from
the Di$cour$es that our finite Judgments make about Infinites, gi-
ving them tho$e attributes which we give to things finite and ter-
minate; which I think is inconvenient; for I judge that the$e
terms of Majority, Minority, and Equality $ute not with Infinites,
of which we cannot $ay that one is greater, or le$s, or equal to ano-
ther: for proof of which there cometh to my mind a Di$cour$e,
which, the better to explain, I will propound by way of Interroga-
tories to <I>Simplicius</I> that $tarted the que$tion.</P>
<P>I $uppo$e that you very well under$tand which are Square Num-
bers, and which not Square.</P>
<P>SIMP. I know very well, that the Square Number is that which
proceeds from the multiplication of another Number into it $elf;
and $o four, and nine, are Square Numbers, that ari$ing from two,
and this from three multiplied into them$elves.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well; And you know al$o, that as the Products are
called Squares: the Produ$ors, that is, tho$e that are multiplied, are
called Sides, or Roots; and the others, which proceed not from
Numbers multiplied into them$elves, are not Squares. So that if I
$hould $ay, all Numbers comprehending the Square, and the not
Square Numbers, are more than the Square alone, I $hould $peak a
mo$t unque$tionable truth: Is it not $o?</P>
<P>SIMP. It cannot be denied.</P>
<P>SALV. Farther que$tioning, if I ask you how many are the
Numbers Square, you can an$wer me truly, that they be as many,
as are their propper Roots; $ince every Square hath its Root, and
every Root its Square, nor hath any Square more than one $ole
Root, or any Root more than one $ole Square.</P>
<P>SIMP. True.</P>
<marg><I>An Infinite Num-
ber, as it contains
infinite Square
and Cupe Roots, $o
it conta neth infi-
nite Square and
Cube Numbers.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. But if I $hall demand how many Roots there be, you
cannot deny but that they be as many as all Numbers, $ince there
is no Number that is not the Root of $ome Square: And this be-
ing granted, it is requi$ite to affirm, that Square Numbers are as
<foot>many</foot>
<p n=>27</p>
many as their Roots, and Roots are all Numbers: and yet in the
beginning we $aid, that all Numbers are far more than all Squares,
the greater part not being Squares: and yet neverthele$s the num-
ber of the Squares goeth dimini$hing alwaies with greater propor-
tion, by how much the greater number it ri$eth to; for in an hun-
dred there are ten Squares, which is as much as to $ay, the tenth
part are Squares: in ten thou$and only the hundredth part are
Squares: in a Million only the thou$andth, and yet in an Infinite
Number, if we are able to comprehend it, we may $ay the Squares
are as many, as all Numbers put together.</P>
<P>SAGR. What is to be re$olved then on this occa$ion?</P>
<P>SALV. I $ee no other deci$ion that it may admit, but to $ay,
that all Numbers are infinite, Squares are infinite, their Roots are
infinite; and that neither is the multitude of Squares le$s than all
Numbers, nor this greater than that: and in conclu$ion, that the
Attributes of Equality, Majority, and Minority, have no place
in Infinites, but only in terminate quantities. And therefore when
<I>Simplicius</I> propoundeth to me many unequal <I>L</I>ines, and demand-
eth of me, how it can be, that in the greater there are no more
Points than in the le$s: I an$wer him, That there are neither more,
nor le$s, nor ju$t $o many; but in each of them infinite. Or if I
had an$wered him, that the Points in one, are as many as there are
Square Numbers; in another bigger, as many as all Numbers; in
a le$s, as many as the Cubick Numbers, might not I have given $a-
tisfaction, by a$$igning more to one, than to another, and yet to
every one infinite? And thus much as to the fir$t difficulty.</P>
<P>SAGR. Hold, I pray you, and give me leave to add unto what hath
been $poken hitherto, a thought which I ju$t now light on, and it
is this, that granting what hath been $aid, me-thinks, that not on-
ly it's improper to $ay, one Infinite is greater than another Infinite,
but al$o, that it's greater than a Finite; for if an Infinite Number
were greater, <I>v. gr.</I> than a Million; it would thereupon follow,
that pa$$ing from the Million to others, and $o to others continual-
ly greater, one $hould pa$s on towards Infinity; which is not $o: but
on the contrary, to how much the greater Numbers we go, $o
much the more we depart from Infinite Number; becau$e in Num-
bers, the greater you take, $o much the rarer and rarer alwaies are
Square Numbers contained in them; but in Infinite Number the
Squares can be no le$s than all Numbers, as but ju$t now was con-
cluded: therefore the going towards Numbers alwaies greater, and
greater, is a departing farther from Infinite Number.</P>
<P>SALV. And $o by your ingenious Di$cour$e we may conclude,
that the Attributes of Greater, Le$$er, or Equal, have no place,
not only among$t Infinites; but al$o betwixt Infinites, and Fi-

<p n=>28</p>
<P>I pa$s now to another Con$ideration; and it is, that in regard
that the Line, and every continued quantity are divideable conti-
nually into divi$ibles, I $ee not how we can avoid granting that the
compo$ition is of infinite Indivi$ibles: becau$e a divi$ion and $ub-
divi$ion that may be pro$ecuted perpetually $uppo$eth that the
parts are infinite; for otherwi$e the $ubdivi$ion would be termina-
ble: and the parts being Infinite, it followeth of con$equence
that they be non-quantitative; for infinite quantitative parts make
an infinite exten$ion: and thus we have a <I>Continuum</I> compoun-
ded of infinite Indivi$ibles.</P>
<P>SIMP. But if we may continually pro$ecute the divi$ion in
quantitative parts, what need have we, for $uch re$pect, to intro-
duce the non-quantitative?</P>
<P>SALV. The very po$$ibility of perpetually pro$ecuting the di-
vi$ion in quantitative parts induceth the nece$$ity of the compo$iti-
on of infinite non-quantitative. Therefore, coming clo$er to you,
I demand you to tell me re$olutely, whether the quantitative parts
in <I>Continuum</I> be in your judgment finite or infinite?</P>
<P>SIMP. I reply, that they are both Infinite, and Finite; Infinite
in Power, and Finite in Act. Infinite in Power, that is, before the
Divi$ion; but Finite in Act, that is, after they are divided: for the
parts are not actually under$tood to be in the whole, till it is di-
vided, or at lea$t marked; otherwi$e we $ay that they are in
Power.</P>
<P>SALV. So that a Line <I>v. gr.</I> twenty foot long, is not $aid to
contain twenty Lines of one foot a piece, actually, but only after
it is divided into twenty equal parts: but is till then $aid to contain
them only in power. Now be it as you plea$e; and tell me whe-
ther, when the actual Divi$ion of $uch parts is made, that fir$t
whole encrea$eth or dimini$heth, or el$e continueth of the $ame
bigne$s?</P>
<P>SIMP. It neither encrea$eth, nor dimini$heth.</P>
<P>SALV. So I think al$o. Therefore the quantitative parts in <I>Con-
tinuum</I> quantity, be they in Act, or be they in Power, make not its
quantity bigger or le$$er: but it is very plain that the$e quantita-
tive parts, actually contained in their whole, if they be infinite,
make it an infinite Magnitude; therefore quantitative parts,
though infinite only in power, cannot be contained, but only in an
infinite Magnitude: therefore in a finite Magnitude infinite quan-
titative parts can be contained neither in Act, nor Power.</P>
<P>SAGR. How then can it be true, that the <I>Continuum</I> may be
ince$$antly divided into parts $till capable of new divi$ions?</P>
<P>SALV. It $eems that that di$tinction of Power, and Act, makes
that fea$ible one way, which another way would be impo$$ible.
But I will $ee to adju$t the$e matters by making another account:
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>29</p>
And to the Que$tion, which was put, Whether the quantitative
parts in a terminated <I>Continuum</I> be finite or infinite; I will an$wer
directly contrary to that which <I>Simplicius</I> replied, namely, that
they be neither finite, nor infinite.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $hould never have found $uch an an$wer, not imagi-
ning that there was any mean term between finite and infinite;
$o that the divi$ion or di$tinction which makes a thing to be either
Finite, or Infinite, is imperfect and deficient.</P>
<P>SALV. In my opinion it is; and $peaking of ^{*} Di$crete Quan-
<marg><I>Quantitative parts
in Di$crete Quan-
tity are neither fi-
nite nor infinite,
but an$werable to
every given Num-
ber.</I></marg>
tities, me thinks that there is a third mean term between Finite and
Infinite, which is that which an$wereth to every a$$igned Number:
So that being demanded in our pre$ent ca$e, Whether the quanti-
tative parts in <I>Continuum</I> be Finite, or Infinite, the mo$t congru-
ous reply is to $ay, that they are neither Finite, nor Infinite, but $o
many, as that they <I>An$wer</I> to any number a$$igned: the which to
do, it is nece$$ary that they be not comprehended in a limited
Number, for then they would not an$wer to a greater: nor, again,
is it nece$$ary, that they be infinite, for no a$$igned Number is infi-
nite. And thus at the plea$ure of the Demander, a Line being
propounded, we may be able to a$$ign in it an hundred quantita-
tive parts, or a thou$and, or an hundred thou$and, according to
the number which he be$t likes; $o that it be not divided into in-
finite. I grant therefore to the Philo$ophers, that <I>Continuum</I> con-
taineth as many quantitative parts as they plea$e, and grant them
that it containeth the $ame either in Act, or in Power, which they
be$t like: but this I add again, that in like manner, as in a Line of
ten yards, there are contained ten Lines of one yard a piece, and
thirty Lines of a foot a piece, and three hundred and $ixty Lines
of an inch a piece, $o it contains infinite Points; denominate them
in Act, or in Power, as you will: and I remit my $elf in this matter
to your opinion and judgment, <I>Simplicius.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. I cannot but commend your Di$cour$e: but am great-
ly afraid, that this parity of the Points, being contained in the like
manner as the quantitative parts, will not agree with ab$olute ex-
actne$s; nor $hall it be $o ea$ie a matter for you to divide the gi-
ven Line into infinite Points, as for tho$e Philo$ophers to divide it
into ten yards, or thirty feet, nay, I hold it wholly impo$$ible to
effect $uch a divi$ion: $o that this will be one of tho$e Powers that
are never reduced to Act.</P>
<P>SALV. The trouble, pains, and long time without which a
thing is not fea$ible, render it not impo$$ible; for I think al$o, that
you cannot $o ea$ily effect a divi$ion to be made of a Line into a
thou$and parts; and much le$s being to divide it into 937, or $ome
other great Prime Number. But if I di$patch this, which you, it may
be, judge an impo$$ible divi$ion, in as $hort a time, as another
<foot>would</foot>
<p n=>30</p>
would require to divide it into forty, you will be content more
willingly to admit of it in our future Di$cour$e?</P>
<P>SIMP. I am plea$ed with your way of arguing, as you now do
mix it with $ome plea$antne$s: and to your que$tion I reply, that
the facility would $eem more than $ufficient, if the re$olving it into
Points were but as ea$ie, as to divide it into a thou$and parts.</P>
<P>SALV. Here I will tell you a thing, which haply will make you
wonder in this matter of going about, or being able to re$olve the
Line into its Infinites, keeping that order which others ob$erve in
dividing it into forty, $ixty, or an hundred parts; namely, by di-
viding it fir$t into two, then into four: in which order he that
$hould think to find its infinite Points would gro$ly delude him$elf;
for by that progre$$ion, though continued to eternity, he $hould
never arrive to the divi$ion of all its quantitative parts: yea, he is
in that way $o far from being able to arrive at the intended term
of Indivi$ibility, that he rather goeth farther from it; and whil$t
he thinks by continuing the divi$ion, and multiplying the multi-
tudes of the parts, to approach to Infinite, I am of opinion, that he
more and more removes from it: and my rea$on is this; In the
Di$cour$e, we had even now, we concluded, that, in an infinite
Number, there was, of nece$$ity, as many Square, or Cube Num-
bers, as there were Numbers; $ince that tho$e and the$e were as ma-
ny as their Roots, and Roots comprehend all Numbers: Next we
did $ee, that the greater the Numbers were that were taken, the
$eldomer are their Squares to be found in them, and $eldomer yet
their Cubes: Therefore it is manife$t, that the greater the Number
is to which you pa$s, the farther you remove from Infinite Num-
ber: from whence it followeth, that turning backwards, ($eeing
that $uch a progre$$ion more removes us from the de$ired term) if
<marg><I>The Unite of all
Numbers may
mo$t properly be
$aid to be Infinite.</I></marg>
any number may be $aid to be infinite it is the Unite: and, indeed,
there are in it tho$e conditions, and nece$$ary qualities of the Infi-
nite Number, I mean, of containing in it as many Squares as Cubes,
and as Numbers.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not apprehend very well, how this bu$ine$s $hould
be under$tood.</P>
<P>SALV. The thing hath no difficulty at all in it, for the Unite
is a Square, a Cube, a Squared Square, and all other Powers; nor
is there any particular what$oever e$$ential to the Square, or to the
Cube, which doth not agree with the Unite; as <I>v. gr.</I> one proper-
ty of two Square-numbers is to have between them a Number
mean-proportional; take any Square number for one of the terms,
and the Unite for the other, and you $hall likewi$e ever find be-
tween them a Number Mean-proportional. Let the two Square
Numbers be 9 and 4, you $ee that between 9 and 1 the Mean-
proportional is 3, and between 4 and 1 the Mean-proportional
<foot>is</foot>
<p n=>31</p>
is 2, and between the two Squares 9 and 4, 6 is the Mean. The
property of Cubes is to have nece$$arily between them two Num-
bers Mean-proportional. Suppo$e 8, and 27, the Means between
them are 12 and 18; and between the Unite and 8 the Means
are 2 and 4; betwixt the Unite and 27 there are 3, and 9. We
therefore conclude, <I>That there is no other Infinite Number but the
Vnite.</I> And the$e be $ome of tho$e Wonders, that $urmount the
comprehen$ion of our Imagination, and that advertize us how ex-
ceedingly they err, who di$cour$e about Infinites with tho$e very
Attributes, that are u$ed about Finites; the Natures of which have
no congruity with each other. In which affair I will not conceal
from you an admirable accident, that I met with $ome time $ince,
explaining the va$t difference, yea, repugnance and contrariety of
Nature, that a terminate quantity would incur by changing or pa$-
$ing into Infinite. We a$$ign this Right Line A B, of any length at
plea$ure, and any point in the $ame, as C being taken, dividing it
into two unequal parts: I $ay, that many couples Lines, (hold-
ing the $ame proportion between them$elves as have the parts
A C, and B C,) departing from the terms A and B to meet with
one another; the points of their Inter$ection $hall all fall in the
Circumference of one and the $ame Circle: as for example, A L
and B L departing [or <I>being drawn</I>] from the Points A and B, and
having between them$elves the $ame proportion, as have the parts
A C and B C, and concurring in the point L: and the $ame pro-
portion being between two others A K, and B K, concurring in K,
al$o others as A I, and B I; A H, and B H; A G, and B G; A F,
and B F; A E, and B E: I $ay, that the points of their Inter$ecti-
on L, K, I, H, G, F, E, do all fall in the Circumference of one
and the $ame Semi-circle: $o that we $hould imagine the point
C to mve conti-
<fig>
nuallyafter $uch
a $ort, that the
Lines produced
from it to the fix-
ed terms A and
B retain alwaies
the $ame propor-
tion that is be-
tween the fir$t
parts A C and C B, that point C $hall decribe the Circumference
of a Circle, as we $hall $hew you pre$ently. And the Circle in $uch
$ort de$cribed $hall be alwaies greater and greater $ucce$$ively,
according as the point C is taken nearer to the middle point
which is O; and the Circle $hall be le$$er which $hall be de$cribed
from a point nearer to the extremity B, in$omuch, that from the
<foot>infinite</foot>
<p n=>32</p>
infinite Points which may be taken in the Line O B, there may be
de$cribed Circles (moving them in $uch $ort as above is pre$cri-
bed) of any Magnitude; le$$er than the Pupil of the eye of a
Flea, and bigger than the Equinoctial of the <I>Primum Mobile.</I>
Now, if rai$ing any of the Points comprehended betwixt the terms
O and B, from every one we may de$cribe Circles, and va$t ones
from the Points nearer to O; then if we rai$e the Point O it $elf,
and continue to move it in $uch $ort as afore$aid, that is, that the
Lines drawn from it to the terms A and B keep the $ame proporti-
on as have the fir$t Lines A O, and O B, what Line $hall be de$cri-
bed? There would be de$cribed the Circumference of a Circle,
but of a Circle bigger than the bigge$t of all Circles, therefore of
a Circle that is infinite: but it doth al$o de$cribe a Right Line, and
perpendicular upon A B, erected from the Point O, and produced
<I>in infinitum</I> without ever turning to reunite its la$t term with the
fir$t, as the others did; for the limited motion of the Point C, after
it had de$igned the upper Semi-circle C H E, continued to de-
$cribe the Lower E M C, reuniting its extream terms in the point
C: But the Point O being moved to de$ign (as all the other Points
of the Line A B, for the Points taken in the other part O A
$hall de$ign their Circles, and tho$e Points neare$t to O the
greate$t) its Circle; to make it the bigge$t of all, and con$e-
quently infinite, it can never return any more to its fir$t term, and
<marg><I>The difference be-
twixt a finite and
infinite Circle.</I></marg>
in a word de$igneth an Infinite Right-Line for the Circumference
of its Infinite Circle. Con$ider now, what difference there is be-
tween a finite Circle, and an infinite; $eeing that this in $uch man-
ner changeth its being that it wholly lo$eth both its being, and
power of being; for we have already well comprehended, that
there cannot be a$$igned an infinite Circle; by which we may
con$equently know that there can be no infinite Sph&aelig;re, or other
Body, or figured Superficies. Now what $hall we $ay to this Meta-
morpho$is in pa$$ing from Finite to Infinite? And why $hould we
find greater repugnance, whil$t $eeking Infinity in Numbers, we
<marg><I>Vnity participates
of Infinity.</I></marg>
come to conclude it to be in the Unite? And whil$t that breaking
a Solid into many pieces, and pur$uing to reduce it into very $mall
powder, it were re$olved into its infinite Atomes, admitting no far-
ther divi$ion, why may we not $ay that it is returned into one $ole
<I>Continuum,</I> but perhaps fluid, as the Water, or Quick$ilver, or
other Metall melted? And do we not $ee Stones liquified into
Gla$s, and Gla$s it $elf with much Fire to become more fluid than
Water?</P>
<P>SAGR. Should we therefore think Fluids to be $o called, be-
cau$e they are re$olved into their fir$t, infinite, indivi$ible com-
pounding parts?</P>
<P>SALV. I know not how to find a better an$wer to re$olve cer-
<foot>tain</foot>
<p n=>33</p>
tain $en$ible appearances, among$t which this is one: When I take
a hard Body, be it either Stone, or Metal, and with a Hammer, or
very fine File, endeavour to divide it, as much as is po$$ible, into
its mo$t minute and impalpable powder; it is very clear, that its
lea$t Atomes, albeit for their $malne$s they are imperceptible, one by
one, to our $ight and touch; yet are they quantitative, figured, and
numerable: and it happens in them, that being accumulated to-
gether, they continue in heap; and being laid hollow, or with a
pit in the mid$t, the hollowne$s or pit remains, the parts heaped
about it not returning to fill it up; and being $tirr'd, or $haken,
they $uddenly $ettle $o $oon as their external mover leaves them,
And the like effects are $een in all the Aggregates of $mall Bodies,
bigger, and bigger, and of any kind of Figure, although Sph&aelig;rical;
as we $ee in heaps of Pea$e, Wheat, Bird $hot, and other matters. But
if we try to find the like accidents in Water, you will meet with
none of them; but, being rai$ed, it in$tantly returns to a level, if
it be not by a ve$$el, or $ome other external $tay upheld; being
made hollow, it pre$ently diffu$eth to fill up the Cavity; and be-
ing long moved, it continually undulates, and $preads its waves very
far. From this, I think, we may very rationally infer, that the minute
<marg><I>Fluid Bodies are
$uch, for that they
are re$olved into
their fir$t Indivi$i-
ble Atomes.</I></marg>
parts of Water, into which it $eemeth to be re$olved, ($ince it hath
le$s con$i$tence than any the fine$t powder, yea, hath no con$i-
$tence at all) are va$tly differing from Atomes quantitative and
divi$ible; nor know I how to find any other difference therein
than that of being indivi$ible. Methinks, al$o, that its mo$t exqui-
$ite tran$parency, affords us $ufficient grounds to conjecture there-
of; for if we take the mo$t diaphanous Chri$tal that is, and begin
to break, and pound it to powder, when it is in powder it lo$eth
its tran$parency, and $o much the more, the $maller it is pounded;
but yet Water which is ground to the highe$t degree, hath al$o the
highe$t degree of Diaphaneity Gold and Silver, reduced by <I>Aqua-
fortis</I> into a $maller Powder than any File can make, yet they con-
tinue powder, and become not fluid; nor do they liquifie till the
Indivi$ibles of the Fire, or of the Sun-beams di$$olve them, as, I be-
lieve, into their fir$t and highe$t infinite and indivi$ible compoun-
ding parts.</P>

every other Metal in a very $hort time; $eeing that that, not very
big, nor very clear, and of a Sph&aelig;rical Concave, with $uch force
melted Lead, and burnt every combu$tible matter: effects, that

of him, that he was like to prove one of the principal Mathemati-
cians of our Age. But returning to the admirable effects of the
Sun- Beams in melting of Metals, are we to believe that $uch, and

Light, albeit mo$t pure, can be without Motion, and that al$o ve-

<P><I>S</I>AGR. But what and how great ought we to judge this Velo-

or, as the re$t of Motions, performed in Time? May we not by
Experiment be a$$ured what it is?</P>
<P>SIMP. Quotidian experience $hews the expan$ion of Light to
be <I>In$tantaneous</I>; in that beholding a Cannon, let off at a great
di$tance, the fla$h of the fire, without interpo$ition of time, is tran$-
mitted to our eye, but $o is not the Report to our ear untill a con-
$iderable time after.</P>
<P>SAGR. True, but, I pray you, what doth this obvious experi-
ment evince; but only this, that the Report is longer in arriving at
our Ear, than the Fla$h at our Eye; but it a$$ures me not, that the
tran$mi$$ion of the Light is therefore <I>In$tantaneous</I> rather than in
Time, but only mo$t $wift. Nor doth $uch an ob$ervation con-
clude more than that other, of $uch who $ay, that as $oon as the
Sun cometh to the Horizon, its Light arriveth at our eye: for who
$hall a$$ure me, that its beams arrive not at the $aid term, afore they
reach our $ight?</P>
<P>SALV. The inconcludency of the$e, and other ob$ervations of
the like Nature, made me once think of $ome other way, whereby
we may without errour be a$certained whether the illumination,
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>35</p>
that is, whether the expan$ion of the Light were really <I>In$tantane-
ous</I>; $eeing that the very $wift Motion of Sound, a$$ureth us, that
that of Light cannot but be extream $wift. And the experiment I
<marg><I>The Velocity of

by Experiment
whether it be In-
$tantaneosu or not.</I></marg>
hit upon, was this; I would have two per$ons take each of them a
Light, which, by holding it in a Lanthorn, or other coverture, they
may cover, and di$cover at plea$ure by interpo$ing their hand to the
fight of each other; and, that placing them$elvs again$t one another,
$ome few paces di$tance, they may practice the $peedy di$covery,
and occultation of their Lights from the $ight of each other: So
that when one $eeth the others Light, he immediatly di$clo$e his:
which corre$pondence, after $ome Re$pon$es mutually made, will
become $o exactly In$tantaneous, that, without $en$ible variation,
at the di$covery of the one, the other $hall at the $ame time ap-
pear to the $ight of him that di$clos'd the fir$t. Having adju$ted
this practice at this $mall di$tance, let us place the two per$ons with
two $uch Lights at two or three miles di$tance; and by night re-
newing the $ame experiment; Let them inten$ely ob$erve if the
Re$pon$es of the di$clo$ures, and occultations do follow the $ame
tenour which they did near hand: for if they keep the $ame pro-
portion, it may be with certainty enough concluded, that the ex-
pan$ion of Light is In$tantaneous; but if it $hould require time in
a di$tance of three miles, which importeth $ix for the going of
one, and return of the other, the $tay would be $ufficiently ob$er-
vable. And if this Experiment be made at greater di$tances,
namely, at eight or ten miles, we may make u$e of the <I>Tele$cope,</I>
the Ob$ervators accommodating each of them one at the places,
where by night the Lights are to be ob$erved; which though not
very big, and $o not vi$ible, at that great di$tance, to the eye at
large; (though ea$ie to be di$clo$ed, and hid) by help of the
<I>Tele$copes</I> before admitted, and fixed they may commodiou$ly be
di$cerned.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Invention $eems to me no le$s certain than ingenu-

<P><I>S</I>ALV. Really, I have not tryed it, $ave only at a $mall di$tance,
namely, le$s than a Mile: whereby I could come to no certainty
whether the apparence of the oppo$ite Light was truly In$tantane-
ous; But if not In$tantaneous, yet it was of exceeding great Velo-
city, and I may $ay Momentary: and for the pre$ent, I would re-
$emble it to that Motion which we $ee a fla$h of Lightning make
in the Clouds ten or more Miles off: of which Light we di$tin-
gui$h the beginning, and, I may fay, the $ource and ri$e of it, in a
particular place in tho$e Clouds; but yet its wide expan$ion imme-
diatly $ucceeds among$t tho$e adjacent: which to me $eems an ar-
gument that it is $ome $mall time in doing; becau$e had the illu-
mination been made all at once, and not by degrees, it feems to

do we by degrees engage our $elves? Among$t <I>Vacuities, Infinites,

the Center C, at the di$tance of the le$$er part C B, let a Circle be
$uppo$ed to be de$cribed, to the Circumference of which from the
point A the Right-line A D is made a Tangent, and indetermi-
nately prolonged towards E: and let the Contact be in D, and
draw a Line from C to D, which $hall be perpendicular to A E;
and let B E be perpendicular to B A, which produced, $hall inter-
<foot>$ect</foot>
<p n=>37</p>
$ect A E, the Angle A being acute: Let the inter$ection be in E,
from whence let fall a Perpendicular to A E, which produced, will
meet with A B infinitely prolonged in F. I $ay, fir$t, that the
Right-lines F E, and F C are equal: $o that drawing the Line
E C, we $hall, in the
<fig>
two Triangles D E C,
B E C, have the two
Sides of the one, D E,
and C E, equal to the
two Sides of the other
B E, and E C; the
two Sides, D E, and
E B, being Tangents
to the Circle D B,
and the Ba$es D C,
and C B, are likewi$e
equal: wherefore the
two Angles D E C,
and B E C, $hall be
equal. And becau$e the Angle B C E wanteth of being a Right-
Angle, as much as the Angle B E C; and the Angle C E F, to
make it a Right-Angle, wants the Angle C E D, tho$e Supple-
ments being equal, the Angles F C E, and F E C $hall be equal,
and $o con$equently the Sides F E, and F C; wherefore making
the point F a Center, and at the di$tance F E, de$cribing a Circle,
it $hall pa$s by the point C. De$cribe it, and let it be C E G. I $ay,
that this is the Circle required, by any point of the Circumfe-
rence of which, any two Lines that $hall inter$ect, departing from
the terms A and B, $hall be in proportion to each other, as are the
two parts A C, and B C, which be$ore did concur in the point C.
This is manife$t in the two that concur or inter$ect in the point E,
that is A E, and B E; the Angle E of the Triangle A E B being
divided in the mid$t by C E; $o that as A C is to C B, $o is A E
to B E. The $ame we prove in the two A G, and B G, determined
in the point G. Therefore being (by the Similitude of the Tri-
angles A F E, and E F B) that as A F is to E F, $o is E F to F B;
that is, as A F is to F C, $o is C F to F B: So by Divi$ion; as A C
is to C F, (that is, to F G) $o is C B to B F; and the whole A B
is to the whole B G, as the part C B to the part B F: and by Com-
po$ition; as A G is to G B, $o is C F to F B; that is, as E F to
F B, that is, as A E to E B, and A C to C B: Which was to be de-
mon$trated. Again, let any other Point be taken in the Circum-
ference, as H; in which the two Lines A H and B H concur. I $ay, in
like manner as before, that as A C is to C B, $o is A H to B H.
Continue H B untill it inter$ect the Circumference in I, and draw
<foot>a</foot>
<p n=>38</p>
a Line joyning I to F. And becau$e it hath been proved already
that as A B is to B G, $o is C B to B F, the Rectangle A B F $hall be
equall to the Rectangle C B G, that is I B H: and therefore, as
A B is to B H, $o is I B to B F, and the Angles at B are equal:
Therefore A H is to H B, as I F, that is E F, to F B, and as A E
to E B.</P>
<P>I $ay moreover, that it is impo$$ible, that the Lines, which have
this $ame proportion, departing from the terms A and B, $hould
meet in any point, either within or without the $aid Circle: For-
a$much as if it be po$$ible that two Lines $hould concur in the
point L, placed without; let them be A L, and B L; and continue
L B to the Circumference in M, and conjoyn M to F. If therefore
A L is to B L, as A C to B C, that is, as M F to F B, we $hall have
two Triangles A L B, and M F B, which about the two Angles
A L B and M F B have their Sides proportional, their upper Angles
in the point B equal, and the two remaining Angles F M B and
L A B le$s than Right Angles (for that the Right-angle at the
point M hath for its Ba$e the whole Diameter C G, and not the
$ole part B F, and the other at the point A is acute by rea$on the
Line A L Homologous to A C, is greater than B L Homologous to
B C) Therefore the Triangles A B L, and M B F are like: and
therefore as A B is to B L, $o is M B to B F; Wherefore the
Rectangle A B F $hall be equall to the Rectangle M B L. But the
Rectangle A B F hath been demon$trated to be equal to that of
C B G: Therefore the Rectangle M B L is equal to the Rectangle
C B G, which is impo$$ible: Therefore the Concour$e of the Lines
cannot fall without the Circle. And in like manner it may be de-
mon$trated that it cannot fall within; Therefore all the Concour-
$es fall in the Circumference it $elf.</P>
<P>But it is time that we return to give $atisfaction to the Intreaty
of <I>Simplicius,</I> $hewing him that the re$olving the Line into its in-
finite Points is not only not impo$$ible, but that it hath in it no
more difficulty than to di$tingui$h its quantitative parts; pre$up-
po$ing one thing (notwith$tanding) which I think, <I>Simplicius,</I>
you will not deny me, and that is this; that you will not require me
to $ever the Points one from another, and $hew you them one by
one di$tinctly upon this paper: for I my $elfe $hould be content,
if without enjoyning to pull the four or $ix parts of a Line from
one another, you $hould but $hew me its divi$ions marked, or at
mo$t inclined to Angles, framing them into a Square, or a Hexa-
gon; therefore I per$wade my $elf, that for the pre$ent you will
grant them then $ufficiently, and actually di$tingui$hed.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $hall indeed.</P>
<P>SALV. Now if the inclining of a Line to Angles, framing

<p n=>39</p>
a Poligon of Forty, of an <I>H</I>undred, of a Thou$and Angles be a
mutation $ufficient to reduce into Act tho$e four, eight, forty,
hundred, or thou$and parts, which were, as you $ay, Potentially
in the $aid Line at fir$t: if I make thereof a Poligon of infinite
Sides, namely, when I bend it into the Circumference of a Circle,
may not I, with the like leave, $ay, that I have reduced tho$e infi-
nite parts into Act, which you before, whil$t it was $traight, $aid
were Potentially contained in it? Nor may $uch a Re$olution be
denied to be made into its Infinite Points, as well as that of its four
parts in forming thereof a Square, or into its thou$and parts in
forming thereof a Mill-angular Figure; by rea$on that there wants
not in it any of the Conditions found in the Poligon of a thou-
$and, or of an hundred thou$and Sides. This applied or layed to a
Right-Line covereth it, touching it with one of its Sides, that is,
with one of its hundred thou$andth parts; the Circle, which is a
Poligon of infinite Sides, toucheth the $aid Right-line with one of
its Sides, that is one $ingle Point divers from all its Colaterals, and
therefore divided, and di$tinct from them, no le$s than a Side of
the Poligon from its Conterminals. And as the Poligon turned
round upon a Plane de$cribes, with the con$equent tacts of its Sides,
a Right-line equal to its Perimeter: $o the Circle, rowled upon
$uch a Plane, de$cribes or $tamps upon it, by its infinite $ucce$$ive
Contacts, a Right-line, equall to its own Circumference. I know
not at pre$ent, <I>Simplicius,</I> whether or no the Peripateticks, (to
whom I grant, as a thing mo$t certain, that <I>Continuum</I> may be di-
vided into parts alwaies divi$ible, $o that continuing the divi$ion
and $ubdivi$ion there can be no end thereof) will be content to
yield to me, that none of tho$e divi$ions are the ultimate, as in-
deed they be not, $ince that there alwaies remains another; but
that only to be the la$t, which re$olves it into infinite Indivi$ibles;
to which I yield we can never attain, dividing and $ubdividing it
$ucce$$ively into a greater, and greater multitude of parts: but
making u$e of the way which I propound to di$tingui$h and re-
$olve all the infinite parts at one only draught, (an Artifice which
ought not to be denied me) I could per$wade my $elf they
would $atisfie them$elves, and admit this compo$ition of <I>Continu-</I>

this one path being more current than any other to extricate us
out of very intricate Laberinths; $uch as are, (be$ides that alrea-
dy touched of the Coherence of the parts of Solids) the concei-
ving the bu$ine$s of Rarefaction and Conden$ation, without
running into the inconvenience of being forced to admit forth of
void Spaces or Vacuities; and for this a Penetration of Bodies: in-
conveniences, which both, in my opinion, may ea$ily be avoided,
by granting the fore$aid Compo$ition of Indivi$ibles.</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>40</p>
<P>SIMP. I know not what the Peripateticks would $ay, in regard
that the Con$iderations you have propo$ed would be, for the mo$t
part, new unto them, and as $uch, it is requi$ite that they be exa-
mined: and it may be, that they would find you an$wers, and
powerful Solutions, to unty the$e knots, which I, by rea$on of the
want of time and ingenuity proportionate, cannot for the pre$ent
re$olve. Therefore, $u$pending this particular for this time, I
would gladly under$tand how the introduction of the$e Indivi$i-
bles facilitateth the knowledge of Conden$ation, and Rarefa-
ction, avoiding at the $ame time a <I>Vacuum,</I> and the Penetration of
Bodies.</P>
<P>SAGR. I al$o much long to under$tand the $ame, it being to
my Capacity $o ob$cure: with this <I>provi$o,</I> that I be not couzen-
ed of hearing (as <I>Simplicius</I> $aid but even now) the Rea$ons of
<I>Ari$totle</I> in confutation of a <I>Vacuum,</I> and con$equently the Solu-
tions which you bring, as ought to be done, whil$t that you ad-
mit what he denieth.</P>
<P>SALV. I will do both the one and the other. And as to the fir$t
it's nece$$ary, that like as in favour of Rarefaction, we make u$e of
the Line de$cribed by the le$$er Circle bigger than its own Cir-
cumference, whil$t it was moved at the Revolution of the greater;
$o, for the under$tanding of Conden$ation, we $hall $hew, how that,
at the conver$ion made by the le$$er Circle, the greater de$cribeth
a Right-line le$s than its Circumference; for the clearer explicati-
on of which, let us $et before us the con$ideration of that which
befalls in the Poligons. In a de$cription like to that other; $up-
po$e two Hexagons about the common Center L, which let be
A B C, and H I K, with the Parallel-lines H O M, and A B C, up-
on which they are to make their Revolutions; and the Angle I, of
the le$$er Poligon, re$ting at a $tay, turn the $aid Poligon till $uch
time as I K fall upon the Parallel, in which motion the point K
$hall de$cribe the Arch K M, and the Side K I, $hall unite with the
part I M; while this is in doing, you mu$t ob$erve what the Side
C B of the greater Poligon will do. And becau$e the Revolution
is made upon the Point I, the Line I B with its term B $hall de-
$cribe, turning backward the Arch B b, below the Parallel c A, $o
that when the Side K I $hall fall upon the Line M I, the Line B C
$hall fall upon the Line b c, advancing forwards only $o much as
is the Line B c, and retiring back the part $ubtended by the Arch
B b, which falls upon the Line B A, and intending to continue af-
ter the $ame manner the Revolution of the le$$er Poligon, this will
de$cribe, and pa$s upon its Parallel, a Line equal to its Perimeter;
but the greater $hall pa$s a Line le$s than its Perimeter, the quan-
tity of $o many of the lines <I>B</I> b as it hath Sides, wanting one;
and that $ame line $hall be very near equal to that de$cribed by
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>41</p>
the le$$er Poligon, exceeding it only the quantity of b B. Here
then, without the lea$t repugnance the cau$e is $een, why the grea-
ter Poligon pa$$eth or moveth not (being carried by the le$s)
with its Sides a greater Line than that pa$$ed by the le$s; that is,
becau$e that one part of each of them falleth upon its next coter-
minal and precedent.</P>
<P>But if we $hould con$ider the two Circles about the Center A,
re$ting upon their Parallels, the le$$er touching his in the point B,
and the greater his in the
<fig>
point C; here, in begin-
ning to make the Revolu-
tion of the le$s, it $hall not
occur as before, that the
point B re$t for $ome time
immoveable, $o that the
Line B C giving back,
carry with it the point C,
as it befell in the Poligons,
which re$ting fixed in the
point I till that the Side
K I falling upon the Line
I M, the Line I B carried
back B, the term of the
Side C B, as far as b, by
which means the Side B C
fell on b c, $uper-po$ing or
re$ting the part B b upon
the Line B A, and advancing forwards only the part <I>B</I> c, equal to
I M, that is to one Side of the le$$er Poligon: by which $uperpo$i-
tions, which are the exce$$es of the greater Sides above the le$s, the
advancements which remain equal to the Sides of the le$$er Poli-
gon come to compo$e in the whole Revolution the Right-line
equal to that traced, and mea$ured by the le$$er Poligon. But
<marg><I>A Circle is a Poli-
gon of infinite in-
divi$ible quantita-
tive Sides.</I></marg>
now, I $ay, that if we would apply this $ame di$cour$e to the ef-
fect of the Circles, it will be requi$ite to confe$s, that whereas the
Sides of what$oever Poligon are comprehended by $ome Number,
the Sides of the Circle are infinite; tho$e are quantitative and di-
vi$ible, the$e non-quantitative and Indivi$ible: the terms of the
Sides of a Poligon in the Revolution $tand $till for $ome time, that
is, each $uch part of the time of an entire Conver$ion, as it is of
the whole Perimeter: in the Circles likewi$e the $tay o$ the terms
<marg><I>An In$tant or Mo-

of its infinite Sides are momentary, for a Moment is $uch part of a
limited Time, as a Point is of a Line, which containeth infinite of
them; the regre$$ions made by the Sides of the greater Poligon, are
not of the whole Side, but only of its exce$s above the Side of the
<foot>G le$$er</foot>
<p n=>42</p>
le$$er, getting forwards as much $pace as the $aid le$$er Side: in
Circles, the Point, or Side C in the in$tantaneous re$t of B recedeth
as much as is its exce$s above the Side B, advancing forward as
much as the quantity of the $ame B: And in $hort, the infinite
indivi$ible Sides of the greater Circle with their infinite indivi$ible
Regre$$ions, made in the infinite in$tantaneous $taies of the infi-
nite terms of the infinite Sides of the le$$er Circle, and with their
infinite Progre$$es, equal to the infinite Sides of the $aid le$$er
Circle, they compo$e and mea$ure a Line equall to that de$cribed
by the le$$er Circle, containing in it $elf infinite $uperpo$itious
non-quantitative, which make a Con$tipation and Conden$ation
without any penctration of quantitative parts: which cannot be
contrived to be done in the Line divided into quantitative parts,
as is the Perimeter of any Poligon, which being di$tended in a
Right-line at length, cannot be reduced to a le$$er length, unle$s
the Sides fall upon and Penetrate one the other. This Con$tipati-
on of parts non-quantitative, but infinite without Penetration of
quantitative parts, and the former Di$traction above declared of
<marg><I>Rarefaction is the
di$traction of infi-
nite Indivi$ibles
by the interpo$ition
of infinite indivi$i-

infinite Indivi$ibles by the interpo$ition of indivi$ible Vacui-
ties, I believe, is the mo$t that can be $aid for the Conden$ation
and Rarefaction of Bodies, without being driven to introduce Pe-
netration of Bodies, or quantitative Void Spaces. If there be any
thing therein that plea$eth you, make u$e of it, if not, account it

that may better $atisfie your Judgment. Only the$e two words
by the way, let us remember that we are among$t Infinites, and In-

<P>SAGR. That the Conceit is ingenious, and to my eares wholly
new, and $trange, I freely confe$s, but whether or no Nature pro-
ceed in this order, I know not how to re$olve; Truth is, that till
$uch time as I hear $omething that may better $atisfie me, that I
may not $tand $ilent, I will adhere to this. But haply <I>Simplicius</I>
may have $omwhat, which I have not yet met with, to explicate
the explication, which is produced by Philo$ophers in $o ab$truce
a matter; for, indeed, what I have hitherto read about Conden$a-
tion, is to me $o den$e, and that of Rarefaction $o $ubtill, that
my weak $ight neither penetrates the one, nor comprehends the
other.</P>
<P>SIMP. I am full of confu$ion, and find great Rubbs in the one
path, and in the other, and more particularly in this new one: for
according to this Rule, an Ounce of Gold might be rarefied and
drawn forth into a Ma$s bigger than the whole Earth, and the
whole Earth conden$ed and reduced into a le$s Ma$s than a Nut;
which I neither believe, nor think that you your $elf do believe:
and the Con$iderations and Demon$trations by you hitherto de-
<foot>livered,</foot>
<p n=>43</p>
livered, as they are things Mathematical, ab$tract and $eparate
from Sen$ible Matter, I believe, that when they come to be apply-
ed to Matters Phy$ical and Natural, they will not exactly comply
with the$e Rules.</P>
<P>SALV. It is not in my power, nor, as I believe, do you de$ire,
that I $hould make that vi$ible which is invi$ible; but as to $uch
things as may be comprehended by our Sen$es, in regard that you
<marg><I>Gold in the gilding
of Silver is drawn
forth and di$gro$-
$ed immen$ly.</I></marg>
have in$tanced in Gold, do we not $ee an immen$e exten$ion to
be made of its parts? I know not whether you may have $een the
Method that Wyer-drawers ob$erve in di$gro$$ing Gold Wyer:
which in reality is not Gold, $ave only in the Superficies, for the
internal $ub$tance is Silver; and the way of di$gro$$ing it is this.
They take a Cylinder, or, if you will, Ingot of Silver, about half
a yard long, and about three or four Inches thick, and this they
<marg>* Or Thumb-
breadths.</marg>
gild or over-lay with Leaves of beaten Gold, which, you know,
is $o thin that the Wind will blow it to and again, and of the$e
Leaves they lay on eight or ten, and no more. So $oon as it is
gilded, they begin to draw it forth with extraordinary force, ma-
king it to pa$s thorow the hole of the Drawing Iron, and then
reiterate this forceable di$gro$sment again and again thorow holes
$ucce$$ively narrower, $o that, after $everal of the$e di$gro$ments,
they bring it to the $malne$s of the hair of a womans head, if not
$maller, and yet it $till continueth gilded in its Superficies or out-
$ide: Now I leave you to con$ider to what a finene$s and di$ten$i-
on the $ub$tance of the Gold is brought.</P>
<P>SIMP. I do not $ee how it can be inferred from this Experi-
ment, that there may be a di$gro$ment of the matter of the Gold
$ufficient to effect tho$e wonders which you $peak of: Fir$t, For
that the fir$t gilding was with ten Leaves of Gold, which make a
con$iderable thickne$s: Secondly, howbeit in the exten$ion and
di$gro$ment that Silver encrea$eth in length, it yet withall dimi-
ni$heth $o much in thickne$s, that compen$ating the one dimen$i-
on with the other, the Superficies doth not $o enlarge, as that for
overlaying the Silver with Gold, the $aid Gold need to be reduced
to a greater thinne$s than that of its fir$t Leaves.</P>
<P>SALV. You much deceive your $elf, <I>Simplicius,</I> for the en-
crea$e of the Superficies is Subduple to the exten$ion in length, as
I could Geometrically demon$trate to you.</P>
<P>SAGR. I be$eech you, both in the behalf of my $elf, and of
<I>Simplicius,</I> to favour us with that Demon$tration, if $o be you
think that we can comprehend it.</P>
<P>SALV. I will $ee whether I can, thus upon the $udden, recall
it to mind. It is already manife$t, that that $ame fir$t gro$s Cylin-
der of Silver, and the Wyer di$tended to $o great a length are two
equal Cylinders, in regard that they are the $ame Silver; $o that
<foot>G 2 if</foot>
<p n=>44</p>
if I $hall $hew you what proportion the Superficies of equall Cy-
linders have to one another, we $hall obtain our de$ire. I $ay there-
fore, that</P>
<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P><I>The Superficies of Equal Cylinders, their Ba$es being
$ub$tracted, are to one another in $ubduple proportion
of their lengths.</I></P>
<P>Take two equall Cylinders, the heights of which let be A B,
and C D: and let the Line E be a Mean-proportional
between them. I $ay, the Superficies of the Cylinder A B,
the Ba$es $ub$tracted, hath the $ame proportion to the Superficies
of the Cylinder C D, the Ba$es in like manner $ub$tracted, as the
Line A B hath to the Line E, which is $ubduple of the proportion
of A B to C D. Cut the part of the Cylinder A B in F, and let the
height A F be equal to C D: And becau$e the Ba$es of equal Cy-
linders an$wer Reciprocally to their heights, the Circle, Ba$e of
the Cylinder C D, to the Circle, Ba$e of the
<fig>
Cylinder A B, $hall be as the height B A to
D C: And becau$e Circles are to one ano-
ther as the Squares of their Diameters, the
$aid Squares $hall have the $ame proportion,
that B A hath to C D: But as B A, is to
C D, $o is the Square B A to the Square of
E: Therefore tho$e four Squares are Pro-
portionals: And therefore their Sides $hall
be Proportionals. And as the Line A B is to
E, $o is the Diameter of the Circle C to the
Diameter of the Circle A: But as are the
Diameters, $o are the Circumferences; and
as are the Circumferences, $o likewi$e are the Superficies of Cylin-
ders equal in Height. Therefore as the Line A B is to E, $o is the
Superficies of the Cylinder C D to the Superficies of the Cylinder
A F. Becau$e therefore the height A F to the height A B, is as the
Superficies A F to the Superficies A B: And as is the height A B
to the Line E, $o is the Superficies C D to the Superficies A F:
Therefore by Perturbation of Proportion as the height A F is to
E, $o is the Superficies C D to the Superficies A B: And, by Con-
ver$ion, as the Superficies of the Cylinder A B is to the Superficies
of the Cylinder C D, $o is the Line E to the Line A F; that is, to
the Line C D: or as A B to E: Which is in $ubduple proportion
of A B to C D: Which is that which was to be proved.</P>
<foot>Now</foot>
<p n=>45</p>
<P>Now if we apply this, that hath been demon$trated, to our
purpo$e; pre$uppo$ing that that $ame Cylinder of Silver, that was
gilded whil$t it was no more than half a yard long, and four or five
Inches thick, being di$gro$$ed to the $inene$s of an hair, is prolon-
ged unto the exten$ion of twenty thou$and yards (for its length
would be much greater) we $hall find its Superficies augmented
to two hundred times its former greatne$s: and con$equently, tho$e
Leaves of Gold, which were laid on ten in number, being di$ten-
ded on a Superficies two hundred times bigger, a$$ure us that the
Gold which covereth the Superficies of the $o many yards of Wyer
is left of no greater thickne$s than the twentieth part of a Leaf of
ordinary Beaten-Gold. Con$ider, now, how great its thinne$s is, and
whether it is po$$ible to imagine it done without an immen$e di-
$tention of its parts: and whether this $eem to you an Experi-
ment, that tendeth likewi$e towards a compo$ition of infinite In-
divi$ibles in Phy$ical Matters: Howbeit there want not other more
$trong and nece$$ary proofs of the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Demon$tration $eemeth to me $o ingenuous, that
although it $hould not be of force enough to prove that fir$t intent
for which it was produced, (and yet, in my opinion, it plainly
makes it out) yet neverthele$s that $hort $pace of time was well
$pent which hath been employed in hearing of it.</P>
<P>SALV. In regard I $ee, that you are $o well plea$ed with the$e
Geometrical Demon$trations, which bring with them certain pro.
fit, I will give you the fellow to this, which $atisfieth to a very cu-
rious Que$tion. In the former we have that which hapneth in
Cylinders that are equall, but of different heights or lengths: it
will be convenient, that you al$o hear that which occurreth in Cy-
linders equal in Superficies, but unequal in heights; my meaning
alwaies is, in tho$e Superficies only that encompa$s them about,
that is, not comprehending the two Ba$es $uperiour and inferiour.
I $ay, therefore, that</P>
<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P><I>Upon Cylinders, the Superficies of which the Ba$es be-

<P>Let the Superficies of the two Cylinders A E and C F be
equall; but the height of this C D greater than the height
of the other A B. I $ay, that the Cylinder A E hath the
$ame proportion to the Cylinder C F, that the height C D hath
to A B. Becau$e therefore the Superficies C F is equall to the

<p n=>46</p>
$uperficies A E, the Cylinder C F $hall be le$$e than A E: For
if they were equal, its Superficies, by the la$t Propo$ition would
be greater than the Superficies A E, and
<fig>
much the more, if the $aid Cylinder C F
were greater than A E. Let the Cylinder
I D be $uppo$ed equal to A E: There-
fore, by the precedent Propo$ition, the
Superficies of the Cylinder I D $hall be
to the Superficies A E, as the height I F
to the Mean-proportional betwixt I F &amp;
A B. But the Superficies A E being by
Suppo$ition equal to C F and I D, ha-
ving the $ame proportion to C F that the
height I F hath to C D: Therefore
C D is the Mean-Proportional between
I F and A B. Moreover, the Cylinder
I D being equal to the Cylinder A E,
they $hall both have the $ame proporti-
on to the Cylinder C F: But I D is to
C F, as the height I F is to C D: Therefore the Cylinder A E
$hall have the $ame proportion to the Cylinder C F, that the line
I F hath to C D; that is, that C D hath to A B: Which was to be

<P>From hence is collected the Cau$e of an Accident, which the
Vulgar do not hearken to without admiration; and it is, how it
is po$$ible that the $ame piece of ^{*}Cloth, being longer one way than
another, if a Sack be made thereof to hold Corn, as the u$ual
manner is, with a Board at the bottom, will hold more, making
u$e of the le$$er breadth of the Cloth, for the height of the Sack,
<marg>* Or Sacking.</marg>
and with the other encompa$$ing the Board at the bottom, than if
it be made up the other way: As if for Example, the Cloth were
one way $ix foot, and the other way twelve, it will hold more,
when with the length of twelve one encompa$$eth the Board at the
bottom, the Sack being $ix foot high, than if it encompa$$ed a
bottom of $ix foot, having twelve for its height. Now, by what
hath been demon$trated, there is added to the Knowledge in ge-
neral that it holds more that way than this, the Specifick, and
particular Knowledge of how much it holdeth more: which is,
That it will hold more in proportion as it is lower, and le$$er, as
it is higher. And thus in the mea$ures afore taken, the Cloth be-
ing twice as long as broad, when it is $ewed the length-ways it will
hold but half $o much, as it will do the other way. And likewi$e

cover new Notions of great Curio$ity, and not unaccompanyed
with Utility. But in the particular glanced at but even now, I
really believe, that among$t $uch as are altogether void of the
knowledge of Geometry, there would not be found one in twen-
ty, but at the fir$t da$h would not be mi$taken, and wonder
that tho$e Bodies that are contained within equal Superficies,
$hould not likewi$e be in every re$pect equal; like as they run in-
to the $ame errour, $peaking of the Superficies, when for deter-
mining, as it frequently falls out, of the amplene$$e of $everal
Cities, they think they have obtained their de$ire $o $oon as they
know the $pace of their Circuits, not knowing that one Circuit
may be equal to another, and yet the place conteined by this
much larger than the place of that: which befalleth not onely in
irregular Superficies, but in the regular; among$t which tho$e
of more Sides are alwayes more capacious than tho$e of fewer;
$o that in fine, the Circle, as being a Poligon of infinite Sides, is
more capacious than all other Poligons of equal Perimeter; of
which I remember, that I with particular delight $aw the Demon-
$tration on a time when I $tudied the Sphere of <I>Sacrobo$co,</I> with
a very learned Commentary upon the $ame.</P>
<P>SALV. It is mo$t certain; and I having likewi$e light upon
that very place, it gave me occa$ion to inve$tigate, how it may
with one $ole Demon$tration be concluded, that the Circle is
greater than all the re$t of regular I$operemitral Figures, and of
others, tho$e of more Sides bigger than tho$e of fewer.</P>
<P>SAGR. And I that take great plea$ure in certain $elect and no-
wi$e-trivial Demon$trations, entreat you with all importunity to
make me a partaker therein.</P>
<P>SALV. I $hall di$patch the $ame in few words, demon$trating
the following Theorem, namely;</P>
<foot>PRO-</foot>
<p n=>48</p>
<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P><I>The Circle is a Mean-Proportional betwixt any two
Regular Homogeneal Poligons, one of which is cir-
cum$cribed about it, and the other I$operimetral to
it: Moreover, it being le$$e than all the circum$cri-
bed, it is, on the contrary, bigger than all the I$operi-
metral. And, again of the circum$cribed, tho$e that
have more angles are le$$er than tho$e that have
fewer; and on the other $ide of the I$operimetral,
tho$e of more angles are bigger.</I></P>
<P>Of the two like Poligons A and B, let A be circum$cribed
about the Circle A, and let the other B, be I$operime-
tral to the $aid Circle: I $ay, that the Circle is the Mean-
proportional betwixt them. For that (having drawn the Semidi-
ameter A C) the Circle being equal to that Right-angled Trian-
gle, of who$e Sides including the Right angle, the one is equal
<fig>
to the Semidiameter A C, and the other to the Circumference:
And likewi$e the Poligon A being equal to the right angled Tri-
angle, that about the right angle hath one of its Sides equal to
the $aid right line A C, and the other to the Perimeter of the $aid
Poligon: It is manife$t, that the circum$cribed Poligon hath the
$ame proportion to the Circle, that its Perimeter hath to the Cir-
cumference of the $aid Circle; that is, to the Perimeter of the
Poligon B, which is $uppo$ed equal to the $aid Circumference:
But the Poligon A hath a proportion to the Poligon B, double to
that of its Perimeter, to the Perimeter of B (they being like Fi-
gures:) Therefore the Circle A is the Mean-proportional be-
tween the two Poligons A and B. And the Poligon A being
bigger than the Circle A, it is manife$t that the $aid Circle
A is bigger than the Poligon B, its I$operimetral, and con$e-
quently the greate$t of all Regular Poligons that are I$operimetral
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>49</p>
to it. As to the other particular, that is to prove, that of the
Poligons circum$cribed about the $ame Circle, that of fewer
Sides is bigger than that of more Sides; but that, on the contrary, of
the I$operimetral Poligons, that of more Sides is bigger than that
of fewer Sides, we will thus demon$trate. In the Circle who$e
Center is O, and Semidiameter O A, let there be a Tangent
A D, and in it let it be $uppo$ed, for example, that A D is the
half of the Side of the Pentagon circum$cribed, and A C the half
of the Side of the Heptagon, and draw the right lines O G C,
and O F D; and on the Center O, at the di$tance O C, draw the
Arch E C I: And becau$e the Triangle D O C is greater than the
Sector E O C, and the Sector C O I greater than the Triangle
C O A; the Triangle D O C $hall have greater proportion to
the Triangle C O A, than the Sector E O C, to the Secant C O I,
that is, than the Secant F O G to the Secant G O A. And, by
Compo$ition, Permutation of Proportion, the Triangle D O A
$hall have greater proportion to the Secant F O A, than the Tri-
angle C O A to the Secant G O A: And ten Triangles D O A
$hall have greater proportion to ten Secants F O A, than four-
teen Triangles C O A to fourteen Sectors G O A: That is the
circum$cribed Pentagon $hall have greater proportion to the Cir-
cle, than hath the Heptagon: And therefore the Pentagon $hall
be greater than the Heptagon. Let us now $uppo$e an Hep-
tagon and a Pentagon I$operimetral to the $ame Circle. I $ay, that
the Heptagon is bigger than the Pentagon. For that the $aid Cir-
cle being the Mean proportional between the Pentagon circum-
$cribed and the Pentagon its I$operimetral, and likewi$e the Mean
between the Circum$cribed and I$operimetral Heptagon: It ha-
ving been proved that the Circum$cribed Pentagon is greater then
the Circum$cribed Heptagon, the $aid Pentagon $hall have greater
proportion to the Circle, than the Heptagon: that is, the Circle
$hall have greater proportion to its I$operimetral Pentagon, than
to its I$operimetral Heptagon: Therefore the Pentagon is le$$er
than the I$operimetral Heptagon. Which was to be demon-
$trated</P>
<P>SAGR. A mo$t ingenious Demon$tration, and very acute. But
whither are we run to ingulph our $elves in Geometry, when as
we were about to con$ider the Difficulties propo$ed by <I>Simpli-
cius,</I> which indeed are very con$iderable, and in particular, that
of Conden$ation, is in my opinion, very ab$truce.</P>
<P>SALV. If Conden$ation and Rarefaction are oppo$ite Motions,
where there is $een an immen$e Rarefaction, one cannot deny an
extraordinary Conden$ation: but immen$e Rarefactions, and,
which encrea$eth the wonder, almo$t Momentary, we $ee every
day: for what a boundle$$e Rarefaction is that of a little quan-
<foot>H tity</foot>
<p n=>50</p>
<marg><I>Rarefaction im-
min$e is that of
a little Gunpow-

tity of Gunpowder re$olved into a va$t ma$$e of Fire? And what,
beyond this, the (I could almo$t $ay) indeterminate Expan$ion
of its Light? And if that Fire and this Light $hould reunite toge-
ther, which yet is no impo$$ibility, in regard, that at the fir$t
they lay in that little room, what a Conden$ation would this be?
If you $tudy for them, you will find hundreds of $uch Rarefacti-
ons, which are much more readily ob$erved, than Conden$ati-
ons: for Den$e matters are more tractable, and $ubject to our
Sen$es. For we can ea$ily order Wood at plea$ure, and we $ee
it re$olved into Fire, and into Light, but we do not in the $ame
manner $ee the Fire and the Light Conden$e to the making of
Wood: We $ee Fruits, Flowers, and many other $olid matters
re$olved in a great mea$ure into Odors, but we do not after the
$ame manner $ee the odoriferous Atomes concurre to the con$titu-
tion of the Oderate Solids; but where Sen$ible Ob$ervation is
wanting, we are to $upply it with Rea$on, which will $uffice to
make us apprehen$ive, no le$$e of the Motion to the Rarefaction
and re$olution of Solids, than, to the Conden$ation of rare and
mo$t tenuous Sub$tances. Moreover, we que$tion how to effect
the Conden$ation and Rarefaction of the Bodies which may be
rarefied and conden$ed, $tudying in what manner it may be done
without introducing of a <I>Vacuum,</I> and Penetration of Bodies;
which doth not hinder, but that in Nature there may be matters
which admit no $uch accidents, and con$equently do not allow
roome for tho$e things which you phra$e inconvenient and im-
po$$ible. And la$tly, <I>Simplicius,</I> I have on the the $core of $atis-
fying you, and tho$e Philo$ophers that hold with you, taken
$ome pains in con$idering how Conden$ation and Rarefaction
may be under$tood to be performed without admitting Penetra-
tion of Bodies, and introducing the Void Spaces called Vacuities,
Effects which you deny and abhorre: for if you would but grant
them, I would no longer $o re$olutely contradict you. There-
fore either admit the$e Inconveniences, or accept of my Spe-
culations, or el$e finde out others more conducing to the
purpo$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. As to the denying of Penetration, I am wholly of opi-
nion with the Peripatetick Philo$ophers; as to that of a <I>Vacuum,</I>
I would $ee the Demon$tration of <I>Ari$totle</I> thorowly examined,
wherewith he oppo$eth the $ame, and what you, <I>Salviatus,</I> will
an$wer to it. <I>Simplicius</I> $hall do me the favour punctually to
recite the proof of the Philo$opher; and you, <I>Salviatus,</I> to an-
$wer it.</P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Ari$totle,</I> as neer as I can remember, breaks out again$t
certain of the Ancients, who introduced Vacuity, as nece$$ary
to Motion, $aying, that this without that could not be effected;
<foot>to</foot>
<p n=>51</p>
to this <I>Ari$totle</I> making oppo$ition, demon$trateth, that on the
contrary, the effecting of Motion (as we $ee) de$troyeth the Po$iti-
on of <I>Vacuum</I>; and his method therein is this. He maketh two
Suppo$itions, one is touching Moveables different in Gravity
moved in the $ame <I>Medium:</I> the other is concerning the $ame
Moveable moved in $everal <I>Medium's.</I> As to the fir$t, he $uppo-
$eth that Moveables different in Gravity, move in the $ame
<I>Medium</I> with unequal Velocities, which bear to each other the
$ame proportion as their Gravities: $o that, for example, a Move-
able ten times heavier than another, moveth ten times more $wift-
ly. In the other Po$ition he a$$umes, that the Velocity of the
$ame Moveable in different <I>Medium's</I> are in Reciprocal to that of
the thickne$$e or Den$ity of the $aid <I>Medium's</I>: $o that $uppo-
$ing <I>v. gr.</I> that the Cra$$itude of the Water was ten times as great
as that of the Air, he will have the Velocity in the Air to be
ten times more than the Velocity in the Water. And from this $e-
cond A$$umption he draweth his Demon$tration in this manner.
Becau$e the tenuity of <I>Vacuum</I> infinitely $urpa$$eth the corpu-
lence, though never $o $ubtil, of any whatever Replete <I>Medi-
um,</I> every Moveable that in the Replete <I>Medium</I> moveth a cer-
tain $pace in a certain time, in a <I>Vacuum</I> would pa$$e the $ame
in an in$tant: But to make a Motion in an in$tant is impo$$ible:
Therefore to introduce Vacuity in the accompt of Motion is im-
po$$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. The Argument one may $ee to be <I>ad hominem,</I> that is,
<marg>Ari$totle's <I>Argu-
ment again$t a</I>
Vacuum <I>is</I> ad
hominem.</marg>
again$t tho$e who would make a <I>Vacuum</I> nece$$ary to Motion;
but if I $hall admit of the Argument as concludent, granting
withal, that in Vacuity there would be no Motion; yet the Po$i-
tion of Vacuity taken ab$olutely, and not in relation to Motion,
is not thereby overthrown. But to tell you what tho$e Ancients,
peradventure, might an$wer, that $o we may the better di$cover
how far the Demon$tration of <I>Ari$totle</I> holds good, methinks that
one might oppo$e his A$$umptions, denying them both. And as
to the fir$t: I greatly doubt that <I>Ari$totle</I> never experimented
how true it is, that two $tones, one ten times heavier than the o-
ther, let fall in the $ame in$tant from an height, <I>v. gr.</I> of an hun-
dred yards, were $o different in their Velocity, that upon the
arrival of the greater to the ground, the other was found not to
have de$cended $o much as ten yards.</P>
<P>SIMP. Why, it may be $een by his own words, that he confe$-
$eth he had made the Experiment, for he $aith, [<I>We $ee the more
grave</I>] now that <I>Seeing</I> implieth that he had tried the Experi-
ment.</P>
<P>SAGR. But I, <I>Simplicius,</I> that have made proof thereof, do a$-
$ure you, that a Cannon bullet that weigheth one hundred, rwo
<foot>H 2 hun-</foot>
<p n=>52</p>
hundred, and more pounds, will not one Palme anticipate the ar-
rival of a Musket-bullet to the ground, that weigheth but half
a pound, falling likewi$e from an height of two hundred yards.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. But without any other Experiments, we may by $hort
and nece$$ary Demon$trations cleerly prove, that it is not true that
a Moveable more grave moveth more $wiftly than another le$$e
grave, confining our meaning $till to Moveables of the $ame Mat-
ter; and, in $hort, to tho$e of which <I>Ari$totle</I> $peaketh. For tell
me, <I>Simplicius</I> whether you admit, that to every cadent grave
Body there belongeth by nature one determinate Velocity; $o
as that it cannot be encrea$ed or dimini$hed in it without u$ing vi-
olence to it, or impo$ing $ome impediment upon it?</P>
<P>SIMP. It cannot be doubted, but that the $ame Moveable in
the $ame <I>Medium</I> hath one e$tabli$hed and by-nature-determinate
Velocity, which cannot be increa$ed, unle$$e with new <I>Impetus</I>
conferred on it, or dimini$hed, $ave onely by $ome impediment
that retards it.</P>
<P>SALV. If therefore we had two Moveables, the natural Velo-
cities of which were unequal, it is manife$t, that if we joyned the
$lower with the $wifter, this would be in part retarded by the
$lower, and that in part accelerated by the other more $wift. Do
not you concur with me in this opinion?</P>
<P>SIMP. I think that it ought undoubtedly $o to $ucceed.</P>
<P>SALV. But if this be $o, and, it be likewi$e true that a great
Stone moveth with ($uppo$e) eight degrees of Velocity, and a le$-
$er with fewer, then joyning them both together, the compound
of them will move with a Velocity le$$e than eight Degrees: But
the two Stones joyned together make one Stone greater than
that before, which moved with eight degrees of Velocity: There-
fore this greater Stone moveth le$$e $wiftly than the le$$er, which
is contrary to your Suppo$ition. You $ee therefore, that from the
$uppo$ing that the more grave Moveable moveth more $wiftly
than the le$$e grave, I prove unto you that the more grave mo-
veth le$$e $wiftly.</P>
<P>SIMP. I find my $elf at a lo$$e, for the truth is, that the le$-
$er Stone being joyned to the greater, weight is added unto it, and
weight being added to it, I cannot $ee why there $hould not Ve-
locity be added to it, or at lea$t why it $hould be dimini$hed
in it.</P>
<P>SALV. Here you run into another errour, <I>Simplicius,</I> for it
is not true, that that $ame le$$er Stone encrea$eth the weight of
the greater.</P>
<P>SIMP. Oh wonderful! this quite $urpa$$eth my apprehen$ion.</P>
<P>SALV. Not at all, if you will but $tay till I have di$covered
to you the Equivokes, of which you are in doubt: Therefore
<foot>you</foot>
<p n=>53</p>
you mu$t know that it is nece$$ary to di$tingui$h betwixt grave
Bodies $et on Moving, and the $ame con$tituted in Re$t; a Stone
put into the Ballance not onely acquireth greater weight, by lay-
ing another Stone upon it, but al$o the addition of, a Flake of
Hemp will make it weigh more by tho$e $ix or ten ounces that
the Hemp $hall weigh; but if you $hould freely let fall the Stone
tied to the Hemp from an high place, do you think that in the
Motion the Hemp weigheth down the Stone, $o as to accelerate
its Motion; or el$e do you believe that it will retard it, $u$tain-
ing it in part? We indeed feel our $houlders laden, $o long as we
will oppo$e the Motion that the weight would make which lyeth
upon our backs; but if we $hould de$cend with the $ame Velocity
wherewith that $ame grave Body would naturally de$cend, in what
manner will you that it pre$$e or bear upon us? Do not you $ee
that this would be a wounding one with a Lance that runneth
before you, with as much or more $peed than you pur$ue him.
You may conclude therefore that in the free and natural fall, the
le$$er Stone doth not bear upon the greater, and con$equently doth
not encrea$e their weight, as it doth in Re$t.</P>
<P>SIMP. But what if the greater was put upon the le$$er?</P>
<P>SALV. It would encrea$e their weight, in ca$e its Motion were
more $wift; but it hath been already concluded, that in ca$e the
le$$er $hould be more $low it would in part retard the Velocity of
the greater, $o that there Compound would move le$$e $wiftly;
being greater than the other, which is contrary to your A$$umpti-
on: Let us conclude therefore, that great Moveables, and like-
wi$e little, being of the $ame Specifical Gravity, move with like
Velocity.</P>
<P>SIMP. Your di$cour$e really is full of ingenuity, yet methinks
it is hard to conceive that a drop of Bird-$hot, $hould move as
$wiftly as a Canon-bullet.</P>
<P>SALV. You may $ay a grain of Sand as fa$t as a Mill-$tone.
I would not have you, <I>Simplicius,</I> to do as $ome others are wont
to do, and diverting the di$cour$e from the principal de$ign, fa-
$ten upon $ome one $aying of mine that may want an hairs-breadth
of the truth, and under this hair hide a defect of another man as
big as the Cable of a Ship. <I>Aristotle</I> $aith, a Ball of Iron of an
hundred pounds weight falling, from an height of an hundred yards,
commeth to the ground before that one of one pound is de$cended
one $ole yard: I $ay, that they arrive at the earth both in the $ame
time: You find, that the bigger anticipates the le$$er two Inches,
that is to $ay, that when the great one falls to the ground, the o-
ther is di$tant from it two inches: you go about to hide under
the$e two inches the ninety nine yards of <I>Ari$totle,</I> and $peaking
onely to my $mall errour, pa$$e over in $ilence the other great one.
<foot><I>Ari-</I></foot>
<p n=>54</p>
<I>Ari$totlee</I> affirmeth, that Moveables of different Gravities in the
$ame <I>Medium</I> move (as far as concerneth Gravity) with Veloci-
ties proportionate to their Weights; and exemplifieth it by
Moveables, wherein one may di$cover the pure and ab$olute effect
of Weight, omitting the other Con$iderations, as well of Figures,
as of the minute Motions; which things receive great alteration
from the <I>Medium,</I> which altereth the $imple effect of the $ole
Gravity; wherefore we $ee Gold, that is heavier than any other
matter, being reduced into a very thin Leaf, to go flying to and
again through the Air, the like do Stones beaten to very $mall
Powder. But if you would maintain the Univer$al Propo$ition, it
is requi$ite that you $hew the proportion of the Velocities to be
ob$erved in all grave Bodies, and that a Stone of twenty pounds
moveth ten times $wifter than one of two: which, I tell you, is
fal$e, and that falling from an height of fifty or an hundred yards,
they come to the ground in the $ame in$tant.</P>
<P>SIMP. Perhaps in very great heights of Thou$ands of yards
that would happen, which is not $een to occur in the$e le$$er
heights.</P>
<P>SALV. If this was the Meaning of <I>Ari$totle,</I> you have in-
volved him in another Errour, which will be found a Lie; for
there being no $uch perpendicular altitudes found on the Earth,
its a clear ca$e, that <I>Ari$totle</I> was not able to have made an Experi-
ment thereof; and yet would per$wade us that he had, whil$t he
$aith, that the $aid effect is <I>$een.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. <I>Ari$totle</I> indeed makes no u$e of this Principle, but of
that other, which I believe is not obnoxious to the$e doubts.</P>
<P>SALV. Why that al$o is no le$$e fal$e than this; and I admire
that you do not of your $elf perceive the fallacy, and di$cern, that
$hould it be true, that the $ame Moveable in <I>Medium's</I> of dif-
ferent Subtilty and Rarity, and, in a word, of different Ce$$ion,
$uch, for example, as are Water and Air, move with a greater
Velocity in the Air than in the Water, according to the propor-
tion of the Airs Rarity to the Rarity of the Water, it would
follow that every Moveable that de$cendeth in the Air would
de$cend al$o in the Water: Which is $o fal$e, that very many
Bodies de$cend in the Air, that in the Water do not onely not
de$cend, but al$o ri$e upwards.</P>
<P>SIMP I do not under$tand the nece$$ity of your Con$equence:
and I will $ay farther, that <I>Ari$totle</I> $peaketh of tho$e Grave-
bodies that de$cend in the one <I>Medium</I> and in the other, and not
of tho$e that de$cend in the Air and a$cend in the Water.</P>
<P>SALV. You produce for the Phil$opher $uch Pleas as he, with-
out all doubt, would never alledge, for that they aggravate the
fir$t mi$take. Therefore tell me, if the Cra$situde of the Water,
<foot>or</foot>
<p n=>55</p>
or whatever it be that retardeth the Motion, hath any proporti-
on to the Cra$$itude of the Air that le$$e retards it; and if it have;
do you a$$ign it us, at plea$ure.</P>
<P>SIMP. It hath $uch a proportion, and we will $uppo$e it to be
decuple; and that therefore the Velocity of a Grave Body, that
de$cends in both the Elements, $hall be ten times $lower in the Wa-
ter than in the Air.</P>
<P>SALV. I will take one of tho$e Grave-Bodies that de$cend in
the Air, but not in the Water; as for in$tance, a Ball of Wood,
and de$ire that you will a$$ign it what Velocity you plea$e, whil$t it
de$cends through the Air.</P>
<P>SIMP. Suppo$e we, that it move with twenty degrees of Velo-
city.</P>
<P>SALV. Very well: And it is manife$t, that that Velocity to
$ome other le$$er, may have the $ame proportion, that the Cra$$i-
tude of the Water hath to that of the Air; and that this $hall be
the Velocity of the two only degrees: $o that exactly to an hair,
and in direct conformity to the A$$umption of <I>Ari$totle,</I> it $hould
be concluded, That the Ball of Wood, which in the Air, ten times
more yielding, moveth de$cending with twenty degrees of Veloci-
ty, in the Water $hould de$cend with two, and not return from the
bottom to flote a-top, as it doth: unle$s you will $ay, that the
a$cending of the Wood to the top is the $ame in the Water, as its
$inking to the bottom with two degrees of Velocity; which I do
not believe. But $eeing that the Ball of Wood de$cends not to the
bottom, I rather think that you will grant me, that $ome other Ball,
of other matter different from Wood, might be found that de$cends
in the Water with two degrees of Velocity.</P>
<P>SIMP. Que$tionle$$e there might; but it mu$t be of a matter
con$iderably more grave than Wood.</P>
<P>SALV. This is that which I de$ired to know. But this $econd
Ball, which in the Water de$cendeth with two degrees of Velocity,
with what Velocity will it de$cend in the Air? It is requi$ite (if
you will maintain <I>Ari$totles</I> Rule) that you an$wer that it will
move with twenty degrees: But you your $elf have a$$igned twen-
ty degrees of Velocity to the Ball of Wood; Therefore this, and
the other that is much more grave, will move thorow the Air with
equall Velocity. Now how doth the Philo$opher reconcile this
Conclu$ion with that other of his, that the Moveables of different
Gravity, move in the $ame <I>Medium</I> with different Velocities, and
$o different as are their Gravities? But, without any deep $tudies,
how comes it to pa$s that you have not ob$erved very frequent,
and very palpable Accidents, and not con$idered two Bodies, that in
the Water will move one an hundred times more $wiftly than the
other, but that again in the Air that $wifter one will not out-go the
<foot>other</foot>
<p n=>56</p>
other, one $ole Cente$m? As for example, an Egge of Marble will
de$cend in the Water an hundred times fa$ter than one of an Hen,
when as in the Air, at the height of twenty Yards it will not anti-
cipate it four Inches: and, in a word, $uch a certain Grave Body
will $ink to the bottom in three hours in ten fathom Water, that
in the Air will pa$s the $ame $pace in one or two pul$es, and $uch
another (as for in$tance a Ball of Lead) will pa$s that number of
fathoms with ea$e in le$s than double the time. And here I $ee
plainly, <I>Simplicius,</I> that you find, that herein there is no place left
for any di$tinction, or reply. Conclude we therefore, that that
$ame Argument concludeth nothing again$t <I>Vacuum</I>; and if it
$hould, it would only overthrow Spaces con$iderably great, which
neither I, nor, as I take it, tho$e <I>Ancients</I> did $uppo$e to be natu-
rally allowed, though, perhaps, with violence they may be effe-
cted, as, me thinks, one may collect from $everal Experiments, which
it would be two tedious to go about at pre$ent to produce.</P>
<P>SAGR. Seeing that <I>Simplicius</I> is $ilent, I will take leave to $ay
$omething. In regard you have with $ufficient plainne$$e demon-
$trated, that it is not true, That Moveables unequally grave move in
the $ame <I>Medium</I> with Velocities proportionate to their Gravities,
but with equal: de$iring to be under$tood to $peak of Bodies of the
$ame Matter, or of the $ame Specifick Gravity, but not (as I con-
ceive) of Gravities different <I>in Spetie,</I> (for I do not think that
you intend to prove unto us, that a Ball of Cork moveth with like
Velocity to one of Lead;) and having moreover very manife$tly
demon$trated, that it is not true, That the $ame Moveable in <I>Me-
diums</I> of different Re$i$tances retain in their Velocities and Tardi-
ties the $ame proportion as have their Re$i$tances: to me it would
be a very plea$ing thing to hear, what tho$e be which are ob$erved
as well in the one ca$e as in the other.</P>
<P>SALV. The Que$tions are ingenuous, and I have many times
thought of them: I will relate unto you the Contemplations made
upon them, and what at length I did from thence infer. After I
had a$$ured my $elf that it was not true, That the $ame Moveable
in <I>Medium's</I> of different Re$i$tance ob$erveth in its Velocity the
proportion of the Ce$$ion of tho$e <I>Media</I>; nor yet, again, That in
the $ame <I>Medium</I> Moveables of different Gravity retain in their
Velocities the proportion of tho$e Gravities ($peaking alwaies of
Gravitles different <I>in $pecie</I>) I began to put both the$e Accidents
together, ob$erving that which befell the Moveables different in
Gravity put into <I>Mediums</I> of different Re$i$tance, and I perceived
that the inequality of the Velocities were found to be alwaies
greater in the more re$i$ting <I>Medium's,</I> than in the more yielding;
and that with $uch a diver$ity, that of two Moveables that, de-
$cending thorow the Air, differ very little in Velocity of Motion,
<foot>one</foot>
<p n=>57</p>
one will, in the Water, move ten times fa$ter than the other;
yea: that $uch, as in the Air do $wiftly de$cend, in the Water not
only will not de$cend, but will be wholly deprived of Motion,
and, which is yet more, will move upwards: for one $hall $ome-
times find $ome kind of Wood, or $ome knot, or root of the $ame,
that in the Water will lye $till, when as in the Air it will $wiftly
de$cend.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have many times $et my $elf with an extream patience
to $ee if I could reduce a Ball of Wax, (which of it $elf doth not
go to the bottom) by adding to it grains of $and, to $uch a degree
of Gravity like to the Water, as to make it $tand $till in the
mid$t of that Element; but I could never, by all the care I
u$ed, $ucceed in my attempt; $o that I cannot tell, whether any
Solid matter may be found $o naturally alike in Gravity to Wa-
ter, as that being put into any place of the $ame, it can re$t or lye
$till.</P>

nion, they do, by making u$e of the In$trument given them by Na-
ture to that end, <I>$cilicet,</I> of that Bladder which they have in their
Bodies, which by a very narrow neck an$wereth to their mouth;
and by that they either, when they would $tand $till, $end forth
part of the Air that is contained in the $aid Bladders, or, $wimming
to the top they draw in more, making them$elves by that art one

plea$ures equilibrating them$elves to the $ame.</P>
<P>SAGR I deceived $ome of my Friends with another device;

of Salt, put into $ix pounds of Water, $hall make that Ball to
a$cend from the bottom to the $urface, which was but a little be-

firmation of the exactne$s of this Experiment, and withall for a
clear proof of the Non-re$i$tance of Water to divi$ion, that not
only the ingravitating it with the mixture of $ome matter heavier
than it, maketh that $o notable difference, but the warming or
cooling of it a little produceth the $ame effect, and with $o $ubtil
an operation, that the infu$ing four diops of other Water, a lit-

Ball to ri$e or $ink in the $ame; to $ink in it upon the infu$ion of

this Argument in a ^{*} Treati$e of our <I>Accademick</I>; yet never the le$s
there is re$ting in me a $trong $cruple, which I know not how to

the parts of Water, how can it bear it $elf up in rea$onable big

without di$per$ing or levelling?</P>

internal Tenacity that is between its parts; $o that it remaineth
ne&oelig;$$ary, that the Cau$e of that Effect do re$ide without. That it
is not Internal, be$ides tho$e Experiments already $hewn you, I can
prove by another mo$t convincing one. If the parts of that Wa-
ter, which con$erveth it $elf in a Globe or Tumour whil$t it is en-
compa$$ed by the Air, had an internal Cau$e for $o doing, they
would much better $u$tain them$elves being environed by a <I>Medi-
um,</I> in which they had le$s propen$ion to de$cend, than they have
in the Ambient Air: But every Fluid Body more grave than the
Air would be $uch a <I>Medium</I>; as, for in$tance, Wine: And there-
fore, infu$ing Wine about that Globe of Water, it might rai$e it
$elf on every $ide, and yet the parts of the Water, conglutinated
<foot>by</foot>
<p n=>59</p>
by the internal Vi$co$ity, never di$$olve: But it doth not happen
$o; nay, no $ooner doth the circumfu$ed liquor approach thereto,
but, without $taying till it ri$e much about it, the little globes of
Water will di$$olve and become flat, re$ting under the Wine, if it
was red. The Cau$e therefore of this Effect is External, and per-
haps in the Ambient Air: and, indeed, one may ob$erve a great
di$$ention between the Air and Water; which I have ob$erved
in another Experiment; and this it is: If I fill a ^{*} Ball of Chri$tal,
<marg>* Or bottle.</marg>
that hath a mouth as narrow as the hollow of a $traw, with water,
and when it is thus full, turn it with its mouth downwards, yet will
not the Water, although very heavy, and prone to de$cend tho-
row the Air, nor the Air, as much di$po$ed on the other hand, as
being very light, to a$cend thorow the Waters, yet will they not
(I $ay) agree that that $hould de$cend, i$$uing out at the mouth,
and this a$cend, entering in at the $ame: but they both continue
aver$e and contumacious. Again, on the contrary, if I pre$ent to
that mouth a ve$$el of red Wine, which is almo$t in$en$ibly le$s
grave than Water, we $hall $ee it in an in$tant gently to a$cend by
red $treams thorow the Water, and the Water with like Tardity to
de$cend through the Wine, without ever mixing with each other,
till that in the end, the Ball will be full of Wine, and the Water
Will all $ink unto the bottom of the Ve$$el underneath. Now
what are we to $ay, or what are we to infer, but a di$agreement
between the Water and Air, occult to me, but perhaps -----</P>
<P>SIMP. I can $carce refrain my laughter to $ee the great Anti-
pathy that <I>Salviatus</I> hath to Antipathy, $o that he will not $o much
as name it, and yet it is $o accommodate to re$olve the doubt.</P>
<P>SALV. Now let this, for the $ake of <I>Simplicius</I> be the $oluti-
on of our $cruple; and leaving the Digre$$ion, let us return to our
purpo$e. Seeing that the difference of Velocity in Moveables of
divers Gravities is found to be more and more, as the <I>Mediums</I> are
more and more Re$i$ting: And withall, that in a <I>Medium</I> of
Quick$ilver, Gold doth not only go to the bottom more $wiftly
than Lead, but it alone de$cends in it, and all other Metals and
Stones move upwards therein, and flote thereon; whereas between
Balls of Gold, Lead, Bra$s, Porphiry, or other grave matters, the in-
equality of motion in the Air $hall be almo$t wholly in$en$ible, for
it is certain, that a Ball of Gold in the end of the de$cent of an
<marg><I>Re$i$tance of the</I>
Medium <I>remo-
ved, all Matters,
though of different
Gravities would
move with like
Velocity.</I></marg>
hundred yards $hall not out-$trip one of Bra$s four Inches: $eeing
this, I $ay, I have thought, that if we wholly took away the
Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium,</I> all Matters would de$cend with equall
Velocity.</P>
<P>SIMP. This is a bold $peech, <I>Salviatus,</I> I $hall never believe
that in <I>Vacuity</I> it $elf, if $o be one $hould allow Motion in it, a lock
of Wooll would move as $wiftly as a piece of Lead.</P>
<foot>I 2 SALV.</foot>
<p n=>60</p>
<P>SALV. Fair and $oftly, <I>Simplicius,</I> your $cruple is not $o ab-
$truce, nor I $o incautelous, that you $hould need to think that I
was not advi$ed of it, and that con$equently I have not found a re-
ply to it. Therefore, for my explanation, and your information,
hearken to what I $hall $ay. We are upon the examination of
what would befall Moveables exceeding different in weight in a
<I>Medium,</I> in ca$e it $hould have no Re$i$tance, $o that all the diffe-
rence of Velocity that is found between the $aid Moveables ought
to be referred to the $ole inequality of Weight. And becau$e on-
ly a Space altogether void of Air, and of every other, though te-
nuous and yielding Body, would be apt $en$ibly to $hew us what
we $eek, $ince we want $uch a Space, let us $ucce$$ively ob$erve that
which happeneth in the more $ubtill and le$$e re$i$ting <I>Mediums,</I>
in compari$on of that which we $ee to happen in others le$$e $ubtill
and more re$i$ting: for if we $hould really find the Moveables
different in Gravity to differ le$$e and le$$e in Velocity, according
as the <I>Mediums</I> are found more and more yielding; and that,
finally, although extreamly unequal in weight, in a <I>Medium</I> more
tenuous than any other, though not void, the difference of Velo-
city di$covers it $elf to be very $mall, and almo$t unob$ervable, I
conceive that we may, and that upon very probable conjecture,
believe, that in a <I>Vacuum</I> their Velocities would be exactly equal.
Therefore let us con$ider that which hapneth in the Air; wherein
to have a Figure of an uniform Superficies, and very light Matter,
I will that we take a blown Bladder, in which the included Air
will weigh little or nothing in a <I>Medium</I> of the Air it $elf, becau$e
it can make but very $mall Compre$$ion therein, $o that the Gravi-
ty is only that little of the $aid film, which would not be the thou-
$andth part of the weight of a lump of Lead of the bigne$s of
the $aid Bladder when blown. The$e, <I>Simplicius,</I> being let fall
from the height of four or $ix yards, how great a $pace, do you
judge, that the Lead would anticipate the Bladder in its de$cent?
A$$ure your $elf that would not move thrice, no nor twice as fa$t,
although even now you would have had it to have been a thou-
$and times more $wift.</P>
<P>SIMP. It is po$$ible that at the beginning of the Motion, that
is, in the fir$t five or $ix yards this might happen that you $ay; but
in the progre$$e, and in a long continuation I believe, that the Lead
would leave it behind, not only $ix, but al$o eight and ten parts of
twelve.</P>
<P>SALV. And I al$o believe the $ame: and make no que$tion,
but that in very great di$tances the Lead will have pa$$ed an hun-
dred miles of <I>way,</I> ere the Bladder will have pa$$ed $o much as one.
But this, <I>Simplicius,</I> which you propound, as an effect contrary to
my A$$ertion, is that which mo$t e$pecially confirmeth it. It is (I
<foot>once</foot>
<p n=>61</p>
once more tell you) my intent to declare, That the difference of
Gravity is in no wi$e the cau$e of the divers velocities of Movea-
bles of different Gravity, but that the $ame dependeth on exteri-
our accidents, &amp; in particular, on the Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium,</I> $o
that, this being removed, all Moveables move with the $ame de-
grees of Velocity. And this I chiefly deduce from that which but
now you your $elf did admit, and which is very true, namely, that
of two Moveables, very different in weight, the Velocities more and
more differ, according as the ^{*} Spaces are greater and greater that
<marg>* Or Waies.</marg>
they pa$$e: an Effect which would not follow, if it did depend on
the different Gravities: for they being alwaies the $ame, the pro-
portion betwixt the Spaces would likewi$e alwaies continue the
$ame, which proportion we $ee $till $ucce$$ively to encrea$e in the
continuance of the Motion; for that the heavie$t Moveable in the
de$cent of one yard will not anticipate the lighte$t the tenth part
of that Space or Way, but in the fall of twelve yards will out-go
it a third part, in that of an hundred will out$trip it 90/100.</P>
<P>SIMP. Very well: But following you $tep by $tep, if the dif-
ference of weight in Moveables of different Gravities cannot
cau$e the difference of proportion in their Velocities, for that the
Gravities do not alter; neither then can the <I>Medium,</I> which is
$uppo$ed alwaies to continue the $ame, cau$e any alteration in the
proportion of the Velocities.</P>
<P>SALV. You wittily bring an in$tance again$t my Po$ition, that
<marg><I>The Velocity of
Grave Bodies de-
$cending Natural-
ly to the Center do
go continually en-
crea$ing till that
by the encrea$e of
the Re$i$tance of
the</I> Medium <I>it
becometh uniform.</I></marg>
it is very nece$$ary to remove. I $ay therefore, that a Grave Body
hath, by Nature, an intrin$ick Principle of moving towards the
Common Center of heavy things, that is to that of our Terre$trial
Globe, with a Motion continually accelerated, and accelerated
alwaies equally, <I>$cilicet,</I> that in equal times there are made equal
^{*} additions of new Moments, and degrees of Velocities: and this
ought to be under$tood to hold true at all times when all acciden-
<marg>* Or aqui$ts.</marg>
tal and external impediments are removed; among$t which there
is one that we cannot obviate, that is the Impediment of the <I>Me-
dium,</I> which is Repleat, when as it $hould be opened and latterally
moved by the falling Moveable, to which tran$ver$e Motion the
<I>Medium,</I> though fluid, yielding and tranquile, oppo$eth it $elf
with a Re$i$tance one while le$$er, and another while greater and
greater, according as it is more $lowly or ha$tily to open to give
pa$$age to the Moveable, which, becau$e, as I have $aid, it goeth
of its own nature continually accelerating, it cometh of con$e-
quence to encounter continually greater Re$i$tance in the <I>Medi-
um,</I> and therefore Retardment, and diminution in the acqui$t of
new degrees of Velocity; $o that in the end, the Velocity arriveth
to that $wiftne$$e, and the Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium,</I> to that
$trength, that ballancing each other, they take away all further
<foot>Acceleration,</foot>
<p n=>62</p>
Acceleration, and reduce the Moveable to an Equable and Uni-
form Motion, in which it afterwards continually abides. There is
therefore in the <I>Medium</I> augmentation of Re$i$tance, not becau$e
it changeth its E$$ence, but becau$e the Velocity altereth where-
with it ought to open, and laterally move, to give pa$$age to the
falling Body, which goeth continually accelerating. Now the
ob$erving, that the Re$i$tance of the Air to the $mall Moment or
<I>Impetus</I> of the Bladder is very great, and to the great weight of
the Lead is very $mall, makes me hold for certain, that if one $hould
wholly remove it, by adding to the Bladder great a$$i$tance, and
but very little to the Lead, their Velocities would equalize each
other. Taking this Principle therefore for granted, That in the
<I>Medium</I> wherein, either by rea$on of Vacuity, or otherwi$e, there
were no Re$i$tance that might abate the Velocity of the Motion,
$o that of all Moveables the Velocities were alike, we might con-
<marg><I>To find the Pro-
portions of the Ve-
locities of different
Moveables in the
$ame, and in diffe-
rent</I> Mediums.</marg>
gruou$ly enough a$$ign the proportions of the Velocities of like
and unlike Moveables, in the $ame and in different, Replear, and
therefore Re$i$ting <I>Medium's.</I> And this we might effect by $tudy-
ing how much the Gravity of the <I>Medium</I> abateth from the Gra-
vity of the Moveable, which Gravity is the In$trument wherewith
the Moveable makes its Way, repelling the parts of the <I>Medium</I>
on each Side: an operation that doth not occur in void <I>Mediums</I>;
and therefore there is no difference to be expected from the di-
ver$e Gravity: and becau$e it is manife$t, that the <I>Medium</I> abateth
from the Gravity of the Body by it contained, as much as is the
weight of $uch another ma$s of its own Matter, if the Velocities of
the Moveables that in a non-re$i$ting <I>Medium</I> would be (as hath
been $uppo$ed) equal, $hould dimini$h in that proportion, we
$hould have what we de$ired. As for example; $uppo$ing that
Lead be ten thou$and times more grave than Air, but Ebony a
thou$and times only; of the Velocities of the$e two Matters, which
ab$olutely taken, that is, all Re$i$tance being removed, would be
equal, the Air $ub$tracts from the ten thou$and degrees of the
Lead one, and from the thou$and degrees of the Ebony likewi$e
abateth one, or, if you will, of its ten thou$and, ten. If there-
fore the Lead and the Ebony $hall de$cend thorow the Air from
any height, which, the retardment of the Air removed, they would
have pa$$ed in the $ame time, the Air will abate from the ten
thou$and degrees of the Leads Velocity one, but from the ten
thou$and degrees of Ebony's Velocity it will abate ten: which is
as much as to $ay, that dividing that Altitude, from which tho$e
Moveables departed into ten thou$and parts, the Lead will arrive
at the Earth, the Ebony being left behind, ten, nay, nine of tho$e
$ame ten thou$and parts. And what el$e is this, but that a Ball of
Lead, falling from a Tower two hundred yards high, to find how
<foot>much</foot>
<p n=>63</p>
much it will anticipate one of Ebony of le$$e than four Inches?
The Ebony weigheth a thou$and times more than the Air, but that
Bladder $o blown, weigheth only four times $o much; the Air
therefore from the intrin$ick and natural Velocity of the Ebony
$ubducteth one degree of a thou$and, but from that, which al$o in
the Bladder would ab$olutely have been the $ame, the Air $ub-
ducts one part of four: $o that by that time the Ball of Ebony
falling from the Tower, $hall come to the ground, the Bladder
$hall have pa$$ed but three quarters of that height. Lead is twelve
times heavier than Water, but Ivory only twice as heavy; the
Water therefore, from their ab$olute Velocities which would be
equal, $hall abate in the Lead the twelfth part, but in the Ivory
the half: when therefore, in the Water, the Lead $hall have de-
$cended eleven fathom, the Ivory $hall have de$cended $ix. And,
arguing by this Rule, I believe, that we $hall find the Experiment
much more exactly agree with this $ame Computation, than with
that of <I>Ari$totle.</I> By the like method we might find the Veloci-
ties of the $ame Moveable in different fluid <I>Mediums,</I> not compa-
ring the different Re$i$tances of the <I>Mediums,</I> but con$idering the
exce$$es of the Gravity of the Moveable over and above the Gra-
vities of the <I>Mediums: v. gr.</I> ^{*} Tin is a thou$and times heavier than
<marg>* Or Pewter.</marg>
Air, and ten times heavier than Water; therefore dividing the ab-
$olute Velocity of the Tin into a thou$and degrees, it $hall move
in the Air, (which deducteth from it the thou$andth part,) with nine
hundred ninety nine, but in the Water with nine hundred only;
being that the Water abateth the tenth part of its Gravity, and
the Air the thou$andth part. Take a Solid $omewhat heavier than
Water, as for in$tance, the Wood called Oake, a Ball of which
weighing, as we will $uppo$e, a thou$and drams, a like quantity
of Water will weigh nine hundred and fifty, but $o much Air will
weigh but two drams,: it is manife$t, that $uppo$ing that its ab$o-
lute Velocity were of a thou$and degrees, in Air there would re-
main nine hundred ninety eight, but in the Water only fifty; be-
cau$e that the Water of the thou$and degrees of Gravity taketh
away nine hundred and fifty, and leaves fifty only; that Solid there-
fore would move well-near twenty times as fa$t in the Air as Wa-
ter; like as the exce$$e of its Gravity above that of the Water is
the twentieth part of its own. And here I de$ire that we may con-
$ider, that no matters, having a power to move downwards in the
Water, but $uch as are more grave in Species than it; and con$e-
quently many hundreds of times, more grave than the Air, in
$eeking what the proportions of their Velocities are in the Air and
Water, we may, without any con$iderable errour, make account
that the Air doth not deduct any thing of moment from the ab$o-
lute Gravity, and con$equently, from the ab$olute Velocity of $uch
<foot>mat-</foot>
<p n=>66</p>
matters: $o that having ea$ily found the exce$$e of their Gravi-
ty above the Gravity of the Water, we may $ay that their Velo-
city in the Air, to their Velocity in the Water hath the $ame propor-
tion, that their total Gravity hath to the exce$$e of this above
the Gravity of the Water. For example, a Ball of Ivory weigh-
eth twenty ounces, a like quantity of Water weigheth $eventeen
ounces: therefore the Velocity of the Ivory in Air, to its Velocity
in Water is very neer as twenty to three.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have made a great acqui$t in a bu$ine$$e of it $elf cu-
rious, and in which, but without any benefit, I have many times
wearied my-thoughts: nor would there any thing be wanting for
the putting the$e Speculations in practice, $ave onely the way
how one $hould come to know of what Gravity the Air, is in com-
pari$on to the Water, and con$equently to other heavy matters.</P>
<P>SIMP. But in ca$e one $hould finde, that the Air in$tead of
Gravity had Levity, what ought one to $ay of the foregoing di$-
cour$es, otherwi$e very ingenuous?</P>
<P>SALV. It would be nece$$ary to confe$$e that they were truly
Aerial, Light, and Vain. But will you que$tion whether the Air
be heavy, having the expre$$e <I>Text</I> of <I>Ari$totle</I> that affirmeth it,
$aying, That all the Elements have Gravity, even the Air it $elf;
<marg>* Or <I>Boracho</I>; a
bottle made of a
Goat skin, u$ed
to hold wine and
other Liquids.</marg>
a $igne of which ($ubjoyns he) we have in that a ^{*} Bladder blown,
weigheth heavier than un$well'd.</P>
<P>SIMP. That a <I>Boracho,</I> or Bladder blown, weigheth more,
might proceed, as I could $uppo$e, not from the Gravity that is
in the Air, but in the many gro$$e Vapours intermixed with it in
the$e our lower Regions; by means whereof I might $ay, that the
Gravity of the Bladder, or <I>Boracho</I> encrea$eth.</P>
<P>SALV. I would not have you $ay it, and much le$$e that you
$hould make <I>Aristotle</I> $peak it, for he treating of the Elements,
and de$iring to per$wade me that the Element of Air is grave,
making me to $ee it by an Experement: if in comming to the proof
he $hould $ay: Take a Bladder, and fill it with gro$$e Vapours;
and ob$erve that its weight will encrea$e; I would tell him that
it would weigh yet more if one $hould fill it with bran; but would
afterwards adde; that tho$e Experiments prove, that bran, and
gro$$e Vapours are grave: but as to the Element of Air, I $hould
be left in the $ame doubt as before. The Experiment of <I>Ari$totle</I>
therefore is good, and the Propo$ition true. But I will not $ay $o
much, for a certain other rea$on taken expre$ly out of a Philo$o-
pher who$e name I do not remember, but am $ure that I have read
it, who argueth the Air to be more grave than light, becau$e it
more ea$ily carrieth grave Bodies downwards, than the light up-
wards.</P>
<P>SAGR. Good i- faith. By this rea$on then, the Air $hall be
<foot>much</foot>
<p n=>65</p>
much heavier than the Water, $ince, that all Bodies are carried
more ea$ily downwards thorow the Air than thorow the Water,
and all light Bodies more ea$ily upwards in this than in that: nay,
infinite matters a$cend in the Water, that in the Air de$cend.
But be the Gravity of the Bladder, <I>Simplicius,</I> either by rea$on of
the gro$$e Vapours, or pure Air, this nothing concerns our pur-
po$e, for we $eek that which happeneth to Moveables that move
in this our Vaporous Region. Therefore, returning to that which
more concerneth me, I would for a full and ab$olute informati-
on in the pre$ent bu$ine$$e, not onely be a$$ured that the Air is
grave, as I hold for certain, but I would, if it be po$$ible, know
what its Gravity is. Therefore, <I>Salviatus,</I> if you have wherewith
to $atisfie me in this al$o, I entreat you to favour me with the
$ame.</P>
<P>SALV. That there re$ideth in the Air po$itive Gravity, and
<marg><I>The Air hath Po-
$itive Gravity.</I></marg>
not, as $ome have thought, Levity, which haply is in no Mat-
ter to be found, the Experiment of the Blown-Bladder, alledged
by <I>Ari$totle,</I> affordeth us a $ufficiently-convincing Argument; for
if the quality of ab$olute and po$itive Levity were in the Air,
then the Air being multiplied and compre$$ed, the Levity would
encrea$e, and con$equently the propen$ion of going upwards:
but Experience $hews the contrary. As to the other demand, that
<marg><I>How that Gravity
may be computed.</I></marg>
is, of the Method how to inve$tigate its Gravity, I have tried to
do it in this manner: I have taken a pretty bigge Gla$$e ^{*} Bottle,
<marg>* <I>Un Fia$co,</I> tho$e
long-neckt gla$$e
bottles in which
we have our
<I>Florence</I> Wine
brought to us.</marg>
with its neck bended, and a Finger-$tall of Leather fa$t about
it, having in the top of the $aid Finger-$tall in$erted and fa-
$tened a Valve of Leather, by which with a Siringe I have made
pa$$e into the Bottle by force a great quantity of Air, of which,
becau$e it admits of great Conden$ation, it may take in two or
three other Bottles-ful over and above that which is naturally con-
tained therein. Then I have in an exact Ballance very preci$ely
weighed that Bottle with the Air compre$$ed within it, adju$ting
the weight with $mall Sands. Afterwards, the Valve being opened,
and the Air let out, that was violently conteined in the Ve$$el, I
have put it again into the Scales, and finding it notably aleviated,
I have by degrees taken $o much Sand from the other Scale, keep-
ing it by it $elf, that the Ballance hath at la$t $tood <I>in Equilibrio</I>
with the remaining counter-poi$e, that is with the Bottle. And
here there is no que$tion, but that the weight of the re$erved Sand
is that of the Air that was forceably driven into the Bottle, and
which is at la$t gone out thence. But this Experiment hitherto a$-
$ureth me of no more but this, that the Air violently deteined in
the Ve$$el, weigheth as much as the re$erved Sand, but how much
the Air re$olutely and determinately weigheth in re$pect of the
Water, or other grave matter, I do not as yet know, nor can
<foot>K I</foot>
<p n=>66</p>
I tell, unle$$e I mea$ure the quantity of the Air compre$$ed: and
for the di$covering of this a Rule is nece$$ary, which I have
found may be performed two manner of wayes, one of which
is to take $uch another Bottle or Flask as the former, and in like
manner bended, with a Finger-$tall of Leather, the end of which
may clo$ely imbrace the Volve of the other, and let it be very
fa$t tied about it. It's requi$ite, that this $econd Bottle be bored in
the bottom, $o that as by that hole we may thru$t in a Wier,
wherewith we may, at plea$ure, open the $aid Volve, to let out
the $uperfluous Air of the other Ve$$el, after it hath been weighed:
but this $econd Bottle ought to be full of Water. All being pre-
pared in the manner afore$aid, and with the Wier opening the
Volve, the Air i$$uing out with impetuo$ity, and pa$$ing into the
Ve$$el of Water, $hall drive it out by the hole at the Bottom:
and it is manife$t, that the quantity of Water which $hall be
thru$t out, is equal to the Ma$$e and quantity of Air that $hall
have i$$ued from th'other Ve$$el: that Water therefore being
kept, and returning to weigh the Ve$$el lightned of the Air com-
pre$$ed (which I $uppo$e to have been weighed likewi$e fir$t with
the $aid forced Air) and the $uperfluous $and being laid by, as I
directed before; it is manife$t, that this is the ju$t weight of $o
much Air in ma$$e, as is the ma$$e of the expul$ed and re$erved
Water; which we are to weigh, and $ee how many times its
weight $hall contain the weight of the re$erved $and: and we may
without errour affirme, that the Water is $o many times heavier
than Air; which $hall not be ten times, as it $eemeth <I>Ari$totle</I>
held, but very neer four hundred, as the $aid Experiment $heweth.</P>
<P>The other way is more expeditious, and it may be done with
one Ve$$el onely, that is with the fir$t accomodated after the man-
ner before directed, into which I will not that any other Air be
put, more than that which naturally is found therein; but I will,
that we inject Water without $uffering any Air to come out,
which being forced to yield to the $upervenient Water mu$t of
nece$$ity be compre$$ed: having gotten in, therefore, as much
Water as is po$$ible, (but yet without great violence one cannot get
in three quarters of what the Bottle will hold) put it into the
Scales, and very carefully weigh it: which done, holding the
Ve$$el with the neck upwards, open the Volve, letting out the
Air, of which there will preci$ely i$$ue forth $o much as there is
Water in the Bottle. The Air being gone out, put the Ve$$el again
into the Scales, which by the departure of the Air will be found
lightened, and abating from the oppo$ite Scale the $uperfluous
weight, it $hall give us the weight of as much Air as there is
Water in the Bottle.</P>
<P>SIMP. The Contrivances you found out cannot but be con-
<foot>fe$$ed</foot>
<p n=>67</p>
fe$$ed to be witty and very ingenuous, but whil$t, me thinks, they
fully $atisfie my under$tanding, they another way occa$ion in
me much Confu$ion, for it being undoubtedly true that the Ele-
ments in their proper Region are neither heavy nor light, I can-
not comprehend, how and which way that portion of Air, which
$eemeth to have weighed <I>v. gr.</I> four drams of $and, $hould af-
terwards have that $ame Gravity in the Air, in which the $and is
contained that weigheth again$t it: and therefore me thinks that
the Experiment ought not to be practiced in the Element of Air,
but in a <I>Medium</I> in which the Air it $elf might exerci$e its quality
of Gravitation, if it really be owner thereof.</P>
<P>SALV. Certainly the Objection of <I>Simplicius</I> is very acute,
and therefore its nece$$ary, either that it be unan$werable, or that
the Solution be no le$$e acute. That that Air, which compre$-
$ed, appeared to weigh as much as that $and, left at liberty in its
Element is no longer to weigh any thing as the Sand doth, is a thing
manife$t: and therefore for making of $uch an Experiment, its
requi$ite to choo$e a place and <I>Medium</I> wherein the Air as well as
the Sand might weigh: for, as hath $everal times been $aid, the
<I>Medium</I> $ub$tracts from the Weight of every Matter that is im-
merged therein, $o much, as $uch another quantity of the $aid
<I>Medium,</I> as is that of the ma$$e immer$ed, weigheth: $o that
the Air depriveth the Air of all its Gravity. The operation, there-
<marg><I>The Air compre$-
$ed and violently
pent up, weigheth in
a</I> Vacuum; <I>and
how its weight is to
be e$timated.</I></marg>
fore, to the end it were made exactly, ought to be tried in a <I>Va-
cuum,</I> wherein every grave Body would exerci$e its Moment
without any diminution. In ca$e therefore, <I>Simplicius,</I> that we
$hould weigh a portion of Air in a <I>Vacuum,</I> would you then be
convinced and a$$ured of the bu$ine$$e?</P>
<P>SIMP. Verily I $hould: but this is to defire, or enjoyn that
which is impo$$ible.</P>
<P>SALV. And therefore the obligation mu$t needs be great that
you owe to me, when ever I $hall for your $ake effect an impo$$ibi-
lity: but I will not $ell you that which I have already given you:
for we, in the foregoing Experiment, weigh the Air in a <I>Vacuum,</I>
and not in the Air, or in any other Replete <I>Medium.</I> That from
the Ma$s, <I>Simplicius,</I> that in the fluid <I>Medium</I> is immerged certain
Gravity is $ub$tracted by the $aid <I>Medium,</I> this commeth to pa$s
by rea$on that it re$i$teth its being opened, driven back, and in a
word commoved; a $ign of which is its pronene$s to return in$tant-
ly to fill the Space up again, that the immer$ed ma$s occupied in it,
as $oon as ever it departeth thence; for if it $uffered not by that
immer$ion, it would not operate again$t the $ame. Now tell me,
when you have in the Air the Bottle before filled with the $ame Air
naturally contained therein, what divi$ion, repul$e, or, in $hort,
what mutation doth the external ambient Air receive from the $e-
<foot>K 2 cond</foot>
<p n=>68</p>
cond Air that was newly infu$ed with force into the Ve$$el? Doth
it enlarge the Bottle, whereupon the Ambient ought the more to
retire it $elf to make room for it? Certainly no: And therefore
we may $ay, that the $econd Air is not immer$ed in the Ambient,
not occupying any Space therein; but is as if it was in a <I>Vacuum,</I>
nay more, is really con$tituted in it, and is placed in Vacuities that
were not repleted by the former un-conden$ed Air. And, really, I
know not how to di$cern any difference between the two Con$ti
tutions of Inclo$ed and <I>Ambient,</I> whil$t in this the <I>Ambient</I> doth
no-ways pre$s the Inclo$ed, and in that the Inclo$ed doth not re-
repul$e the <I>Ambient</I>: and $uch is the placing of any matter in a
<I>Vacuum,</I> and the $econd Air compre$sed in the Flask. The weight
therefore that is found in that $ame conden$ed Air, is the $ame that
it would have, were it freely di$tended in a <I>Vacuum.</I> Tis true in-
deed, that the weight of the Sand that weigheth again$t it, as ha-
ving been in the open Air, would in a <I>Vacuum</I> have been a little
more than ju$t $o heavy; and therefore it is nece$$ary to $ay, that
the weighed Air is in reality $omewhat le$$e heavy than the Sand
that counterpoi$eth it, that is, $o much, by how much the like
quantity of Air would weigh in a <I>Vacuum.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. I had thought that there was $omething to have been
wi$hed for in the Experiments before produced; but now I am
thorowly $atisfied.</P>
<marg><I>The difference,
though very great,
of the Gravity of
Moveables hath
no part in differer-
cing their Veloci-
ties.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. The things by me hitherto alledged, and in particular,
this, That the difference of Gravity, although exceeding great,
hath no part in diver$ifying the Velocities of Moveables, $o that,
notwith$tanding any thing depending on that, they would all
move with equal Celerity, is $o new, and at the fir$t apprehen$i-
on $o remote from probability, that, were there not a way to de-
lucidate it, and make it as clear as the Sun, it would be better
to pa$$e it over in $ilence, than to divulge it: therefore $eeing
that I have let it e$cape from me, its fit that I omit neither Expe-
riment nor Rea$on that may corroborate it.</P>
<P>SAGR. Not onely this, but many other al$o of your A$$erti-
ons are $o remote from the Opinions and Doctrines commonly
received, that $ending them abroad, you would $tir up a great
number of Antagoni$ts: in regard, that the innate Di$po$ition of
Men doth not $ee with good eyes, when others in their Studies
di$cover Truths or Fallacies, that were not di$covered by them-
$elves: and with the title of Innovators of Doctrines, little plea-
$ing to the ears of many, they $tudy to cut tho$e knots which
they cannot untie, and with $ub-terranean Mines to blow up
tho$e Structures, which have been with the ordinary Tools by
patient Architects erected: but with us here, who are far from
any $uch thoughts, your Experiments and Arguments are
<foot>$uf-</foot>
<p n=>69</p>
$ufficient to give full $atisfaction: yet neverthele$$e, if $o be you
have other more palpable Experiments, and more convincing
Rea$ons we would very gladly hear them.</P>
<P>SALV. The Experiment made with two Moveables, as different
in weight as may be, by letting them de$cend from a place on
high, thereby to $ee whether their Velocity be equal, meets with
$ome difficulty: for if the height $hall be great, the <I>Medium,</I>
which is to be opened and laterally repelled by the <I>Impetus</I> of the
cadent Body, $hall be of much greater prejudice to the $mall Mo-
ment of the light Moveable, than to the violence of the heavy
one; whereupon in a long way the light one will be left behind:
and in a little altitude it might be doubted whether there were
really any difference, or if there were, whether it would be
$en$ible. Therefore I have oft been thinking to reiterate the de-
$cent $o many times from $mall heights, and to accumulate toge-
ther $o many of tho$e minute differences of time, as might inter-
cede between the arrival or fall of the heavy Body to the ground,
and the arrival of the light one, which $o conjoyned, would make
a time not onely ob$ervable, but ob$ervable with much facility
Moreover, that I might help my $elf with Motions as $low as po$-
$ible may be, in which the Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium</I> operates
le$$e in altering the effect that dependeth on $imple Gravity, I
have had thoughts to cau$e the Moveable to de$cend upon a de-
clining Plane, not much rai$ed above the Plane of the Horizon;
for upon this, no le$$e than in perpendicularity, we may di$cover
that which is done by Grave Bodies different in weight: and pro-
ceeding farther, I have de$ired to free my $elf from any what$o-
ever impediment, that might ari$e from the Contact of the $aid
Moveables upon the $aid declining Plane: and la$tly, I have ta-
ken two Balls, one of Lead, and one of Cork, that above an hun-
dred times more grave than this, and have fa$tened them to two
$mall threads, each equally four or five yards long, tyed on
high: and having removed a$wel the one as the other Ball from
the $tate of Perpendicularity, I have let them both go in the $ame
Moment, and they de$cending by the Circumferences of Circles
de$cribed by the equal Strings their Semidiameters, and having
pa$$ed beyond the Perpendicular, they afterwards by the $ame
way returned back, and reiterating the$e Vibrations, and re-
turns of them$elves neer an hundred times, they have $hewn ve-
ry $en$ibly, that the grave <I>Pendulum</I> moveth $o exactly under the
time of the light one, that it doth not in an hundred, no nor in a
thou$and Vibrations, anticipate the time of one $mall moment,
but that they keep an equal pa$$e in their Recur$ions. They al$o
$hew the Operation of the <I>Medium,</I> which conferring $ome im-
pediment on the Motion, doth much more dimini$h the Vibrati-
<foot>ons</foot>
<p n=>70</p>
ons of the Cork, than that of the Lead: not that it maketh them
more or le$$e frequent, nay, when the Arches pa$$ed by the Cork
were not of above five or $ix degrees, and tho$e of the Lead fif-
ty, they did pa$s them under the $ame times.</P>
<P>SIMP. If this be $o, how is it then that the Velocity of the
Lead is not greater than that of the Cork? that pa$$ing a jour-
ney of $ixty degrees, in the time that this pa$seth hardly $ix?</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. But what would you $ay, <I>Simplicius,</I> in ca$e they
$hould both di$patch their Recur$ions in the $ame time, when the
Cork being removed thirty degrees from the Perpendicular,
$hould pa$s an arch of $ixty, and the Lead removed from the
$ame middle point onely two degrees, $hould run an arch of four?
would not then the Cork be $o much more $wift than the Lead?
and yet Experience $hews that $o it happeneth: therefore ob$erve,
The <I>Pendulum</I> of Lead being carried <I>v. gr.</I> fifty degrees from the
Perpendicular, and thence let go, $wingeth, and pa$$ing beyond
the Perpendicular, neer fifty more degrees, de$cribeth an arch
of well neer an hundred degrees; and returning of its $elf back
again, it de$cribeth another arch, not much le$$e than the former,
and continuing its Vibrations, after a great number of them, it
finally returneth to Re$t: Each of tho$e Vibrations are made un-
der equal times a$wel tho$e of ninety degrees, as tho$e of fifty,
twenty, ten, or four; $o that by con$equence, the Velocity of the
Moveable doth $ucce$$ively langui$h and abate, in regard, that
under equal times it doth $ucce$$ively pa$$e arches continually
le$$er and le$$er. The like, yea the $elf $ame effect is performed
by the Cork, hanging by a $tring of the like length, $ave that
in a le$$e number of Vibracions it returneth to Re$t, as being le$s
apt, by means of its Levity, to overcome the ob$tacle of the Air:
and yet neverthele$s all the Vibrations, both great and $mall, are
made under times equal to one another, and equal al$o to the
times of the times of the Vibrations of the Lead. Whereupon it
is true, that if whil$t the Lead pa$$eth an arch of fifty degrees,
the Cork pa$seth one but of ten, the Cork is then more $low
than the Lead: but it will al$o happen on the other $ide, that the
Cork pa$seth the arch of fifty degrees, when the Lead pa$seth
but that of ten or $ix; and $o in $everal times the Lead $hall be
$wifter onewhile, and the Cork another while: but if the $ame
Moveables $hall al$o under the $ame equal times, pa$s arches that
are equal, one may then very $afely $ay, that their Velocities are
equal.</P>
<P>SIMP. This di$cour$e $eems to me concluding, and not con-
cluding, and I finde in my thoughts $uch a Confu$ion, ari$ing
from the one-while $wift, another-while $low, another-while ex-
treme $low motion of both the one and other Moveable; as that
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>71</p>
it permits me not to di$cern clearly, whether it be true, That their
Velocities are alwaies equal.</P>
<P>SAGR. Give me leave, I pray you, <I>Salviatus,</I> to interpo$e two
words. And tell me, <I>Simplicius,</I> whether you admit, that it may be
$aid with ab$olute verity that the Velocities of the Cork and of
the Lead are equal, in ca$e, that both of them departing at the
$ame moment from Re$t, and moving by the $ame declivities, they
$hould alwaies pa$$e equal Spaces in equal times?</P>
<P>SIMP. This admits of no doubt, nor can it be contradicted.</P>
<P>SAGR. It hapneth now in the Pendulums that each of them
pa$$eth now $ixty degrees, now fifty, now thirty, now ten, now
eight, four, and two; and when each of them pa$$eth the Arch of
$ixty degrees they pa$$e it in the $ame time; in the Arch of fifty the
$ame time is $pent by both the one and the other Moveable; $o in
the Arch of thirty, of ten, and of the re$t: and therefore it is con-
cluded, that the Velocity of the Lead in the Arch of $ixty degrees,
is equal to the Velocity of the Cork in the $ame Arch of $ixty de-
grees: and that the Velocities in the Arch of fifty, are likewi$e
equal to one the other, and $o in the re$t. But it is not $aid, that the
Velocity that is exerci$ed in the Arch of $ixty is equal to the Ve-
locity that is exerci$ed in the Arch of fifty, nor this to that of the
Arch of thirty. But the Velocities are alwaies le$$er, in the le$$er
Arches. And this is collected from our $en$ibly $eeing the $ame
Moveable con$ume as much time in pa$$ing the great Arch of $ixty
degrees, as in pa$$ing the le$$er of fifty, or the lea$t of ten: and, in a
word, in their being all pa$$ed alwaies under equal times. It is true
therefore, that both the Lead and the Cork $ucce$$ively retard the
Motion, according to the Diminution of the Arches, but yet do
not alter their harmony in keeping the equality of Velocity in all
the $ame Arches by them pa$$ed. I de$ired to $ay thus much, more
to try whether I have rightly apprehended the Conceit of <I>Salvia-
tus,</I> than out of any nece$$ity that I thought <I>Simplicius</I> to $tand in
of a more plain Explanation than that of <I>Salviatus,</I> which is, as
in all other things, extreamly clear, and $uch, that, it being fre-
quent with him to re$olve Que$tions, in appearance not only ob-
$cure, but repugnant to Nature, and to the Truth, with Rea$ons,
or Ob$ervations, or Experiments very trite and familiar to every
one, it hath (as I have under$tood from divers) given occa$ion to
one of the mo$t e$teemed Profe$$ors of our Age to put the le$$e
e$teem upon his Novelties, holding them to have as much of Sor-
didne$$e, for that they depend on over low and popular Funda-
mentals: as if the mo$t admirable and mo$t-to-be-prized Proper-
ty of the Demon$trative Sciences, were not to $pring and ari$e
from Principles known, under$tood, and granted by every one.
But let us, for all that, continue to banquet our $elves with this diet
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>72</p>
that is $o light of dige$tion; and $uppo$ing that <I>Simplicius</I> is fully
$atisfied in under$tanding and admitting, That the intern Gravity
of different Moveables hath no $hare in differencing their Veloci-
ties, $o that all of them, for ought that dependeth on that, would
move with the $ame Velocities; tell us, <I>Salviatus,</I> in what you
place the $en$ible and apparent inequalities of Motion; and an-
$wer to that In$tance that <I>Simplicius</I> produceth, and which I like-
wi$e confirm, I mean, of $eeing a Cannon Bullet move more $wift-
ly than a drop of Bird-$hot, for the difference of Velocity $hall be
but $mall, in re$pect of that which I object again$t you of Movea-
bles of the $ame matter, of which $ome of the greater will de$cend
in a <I>Medium,</I> in le$$e than one beat of the Pul$e, that $pace, that

<I>Medium</I> can with $o great difference dimini$h the Velocity in
Moveables that differ only in Magnitude, although they are of
the $ame Matter, and of the $ame Figure, requireth for its expli-
cation a more $ubtil di$cour$e, than that which $ufficeth for under-

tardeth the Velocity of the $aid Moveable. I reduce the cau$e of
the $aid Problem to the Scabro$ity, and Poro$ity, that is common-
ly, and, for the mo$t part, nece$$arily found in the Superficies of
Solid Bodies, the which Scabro$ities, in their Motion, go repul$ing
and commoving the Air, or other Ambient <I>Medium</I>: of which we
have an evident te$timony, in that we hear the Bodies, though made
as round as is po$$ible for them to be, to hum whil$t they pa$$e ve-
ry $wiftly thorow the Air; and they are not only heard to hum, but
to whir and whi$tle, if there be but in them $ome more than ordi-
nary cavity or prominency. We $ee al$o, that in turning round
every rotund Solid maketh a little wind: And what need more?
Do we not hear a notable whirring, and in a very $harp Accent,
made by a Top, while it turneth round on the ground with great
Celerity? The $hrilne$s of which whizzing groweth flatter accor-
ding as the Velocity of the <I>Vertigo</I> doth by degrees more and
more $lacken: a nece$$ary Argument likewi$e of the commotion
and percu$$ion of the Air by tho$e (though very $mall) Scabro$i-
<foot>ties</foot>
<p n=>73</p>
ties of their Superficies. It is not to be doubted, but that the$e in the
de$cent of Moveables, grating upon, and repul$ing the fluid Am-
bient, procure retardment in the Velocity, and $o much the greater,
by how much the Superficies $hall be greater, as is that of le$$er
Solids compared to bigger.</P>
<P>SIMP. Stay, I pray you, for here I begin to be at a lo$$e: for
though I under$tand and admit, that the Confrication of the <I>Medi-
um</I> with the Superficies of the Moveable retardeth the Motion,
and that it more retardeth it where <I>(ceteris paribus)</I> the Superficies
is greater, yet do I not comprehend upon what ground you call the
Superficies of le$$er Solids greater: &amp; farthermore if, as you affirm, the
greater Superficies ought to cau$e greater retardment, the greater
Solids ought to be the $lower, which is not $o: but this Objection
may ea$ily be removed, by $aying, that although the greater hath
a greater Superficies, it hath al$o a greater Gravity, upon which
the impediment of the greater Superficies hath not $o much more
prevalent influence, than the impediment of the le$$er Superficies
hath upon the le$$er Gravity, as that the Velocity of the greater
Solid $hould become the le$$er. And therefore I $ee no rea$on why
one $hould alter the equality of the Velocities, whil$t, that looking
how much the Moving Gravity dimini$heth, the faculty of the Re-
tarding Superficies doth dimini$h at the $ame rate.</P>
<P>SALV. I will re$olve all that which you object in one word.
Therefore, <I>Simplicius,</I> you will without controver$ie admit, that
when, of two equal Moveables of the $ame Matter, and alike in Fi-
gure (which undoubtedly would move with equal $wiftne$$e) as
well the Gravity, as the Superficies of one of them dimini$heth,
(yet $till retaining the $imilitude of Figure) the Velocity like-
wi$e, for the $ame rea$on, would not be dimini$hed in that which
was le$$ened.</P>
<P>SIMP. Really, I think, that it ought $o to follow as you $ay,
granting the pre$ent Doctrine with a <I>$alvo</I> $till to our Doctrine,
which teacheth, that the greater or le$$er Gravity hath no operati-
on in accelerating or retarding Motion.</P>
<P>SALV. And this I confirm; and grant you likewi$e your Po-
$ition, from whence, in my opinion, may be inferred, That in ca$e
the Gravity dimini$heth more than the Superficies, there may be
introduced in the Moveable, in that manner dimini$hed, $ome re-
tardment of Motion, and that greater and greater, by how much in
proportion, the diminution of the Weight was greater than the di-
minution of the Superficies</P>
<P>SIMP. I make not the lea$t que$tion of it.</P>
<marg><I>Solids cannot be
dimini$hed at the
$ame rate in Super-
ficies as in Weight,
retaining the $imi-
litude of the Fi-
gures.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. Now know, <I>Simplicius,</I> that in Solids one cannot di-
mini$h the Superficies $o much as the Weight keeping the $imili-
tude of Figure. For it being manife$t, that in dimini$hing of grave
<foot>L Solids,</foot>
<p n=>74</p>
Solids, the Weight le$$eneth as much as the Bulk, when ever the
Bulk happens to be dimini$hed more than the Superficies, (care
being had to retain the $imilitude of Figure) the Gravity likewi$e
would come to be more dimini$hed than the Superficies. But <I>Geo-
metry</I> teacheth us, that there is much greater proportion between
the Bulk and the Bulk in like Solids, than between their Superfi-
cies. Which for your better under$tanding, I $hall explain in $ome
particular ca$e. Therefore fancy to your $elf, for example, a Dye,
one of the Sides of which is <I>v. gr.</I> two Inches long, $o that one of
its Surfaces $hall be four Square Inches, and all $ix, that is, all its
Superficies twenty four Square Inches. Then $uppo$e the $ame
Dye at three $awings cut into eight $mall Dice, the Side of every
one of which will be one Inch, and one of its Surfaces an Inch
Square, and its whole Superficies $ix Square Inches, of which the
whole Dye contained twenty four in its Superficial content. Now,
you $ee, that the Superficial content of the little Dye is the fourth
part of the Superficial content of the great one, (for $ix is the
fourth part of twenty four) but the Solid content of the $aid Dye
is only the eighth part: therefore the Bulk, and con$equently the
Weight, doth much more dimini$h than the Superficies. And if
you $ubdivide the little Dye into eight others, we $hall have for
the whole Superficial content of one of the$e, one and an half
Square Inches, which is the $ixteenth part of the Superficies of the
fir$t Dye; but its Bulk, or Ma$s, is only the $ixty fourth part of that.
You $ee therefore, how that in only the$e two divi$ions the Bulks
decrea$e four times fa$ter than their Superficies: and if we $hould
pro$ecute the Subdivi$ion, untill that we had reduced the fir$t So-
lid into a $mall powder, we $hould find the Gravity of the minute
Atomes to be le$$ened an hundred and an hundred times more
than their Superficies. And this which I have exemplified in
Cubes, hapneth in all like Solids, the Bulks of which are in Se$-
quialter proportion of their Superficies. You $ee, therefore, in how
much greater proportion the Impediment of the Contact of the
Superficies of the Moveable with the <I>Medium</I> encrea$eth in $mall
Moveables, than in greater: and if we $hould add, that the Sca-
bro$ities in the very $mall Superficies of the minute Atomes are
not happily le$$er than tho$e of the Superficies of greater Solids,
that are diligently poli$hed, ob$erve how fluid, and void of all Re-
$i$tance being opened, the <I>Medium</I> is required to be, when it is to
give pa$$age to $o feeble a Virtue. And therefore take notice, <I>Sim-
plicius,</I> that I did not equivocate, when even now I $aid, That the
Superficies of le$$er Solids is greater, in compari$on of that of
bigger.</P>
<P>SIMP. I am wholly $atisfied: and I verily believe, that if I were
to begin my Studies again, I $hould follow the Coun$el of <I>Plato,</I>
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>75</p>
and enter my $elf fir$t in the Mathematicks, which I $ee to proceed
very $crupulou$ly, and refu$e to admit any thing for certain, $ave
that which they nece$$arily demon$trate.</P>
<P>SAGR. I have taken great delight in this Di$cour$e; but, be-
fore we pa$$e any further, I would be glad to be $atisfied in one
particular, which newly came into my thoughts, when but ju$t
now you $aid, that Like-Solids are in Se$quialter proportion to
their Superficies for I have $een, and under$tood the Propo$ition
<marg><I>Solids are to each
other in Se$quial-
ter proportion to
their Superficies.</I></marg>
with its Demon$tration, in which it is proved, That the Superficies
of Like-Solids are in duplicate proportion of their Sides; and ano-
ther that proveth the $ame Solids to be in triple proportion of the
$ame Sides; but the proportion of Solids to their Superficies, I do
not remember that I ever $o much as heard it mentioned.</P>
<P>SALV. You your $elf have an$wered and declared the doubt.
For that which is triple of a thing of which another is double, doth
it not come to be Se$quialter of this double? Yes doubtle$$e. Now,
if Superficies are in double proportion of the Lines, of which the
Solids are in triple proportion, may not we $ay, That the Solids are
in Se$quialter proportion of their Superficies?</P>
<P>SAGR. I under$tand you very well. And although other par-
ticulars, pertaining to the matter of which we have treated, do re-
main for me to ask, yet if we $hould thus run from one Digre$$ion
to another, it will be late before we $hould come to the Que$tions
principally intended, which concern the diver$ities of the Acci-
dents of the Re$i$tances of Solids again$t Fraction; and therefore,
if you $o plea$e, we may return to the fir$t Theme, which we pro-
po$ed in the beginning.</P>
<P>SALV. You $ay very well; but the $o many, and $o different
things that have been examined, have $toln $o much of our time,
that there is but little of it left in this day to $pend in our other
principal Argument, which is full of Geometrical Demon$trati-
ons that are to be con$idered with attention: $o that I $hould think
it were better to adjourn our meeting till to morrow, as well for
this which I have told you, as al$o becau$e I might bring with me
$ome Papers, on which I have, in order, $et down the Theorems and
Problems, in which are propo$ed and demon$trated the different
Pa$$ions of this Subject, which, it may be, would not otherwi$e
with requi$ite Method come into my mind.</P>
<P>SAGR. I very gladly comply with your advice, and $o much the
more willingly, in regard that, for a Conclu$ion of this daies Con-
ference, I $hall have time to hear you re$olve $ome doubts that I
find in my mind concerning the Point la$t handled. Of which one
is, Whether we are to hold, that the Impediment of the <I>Medium</I>
may be $ufficient to a$$ign bounds to the Acceleration of Bodies of
very grave Matter, that are of great Bulk, and of a Spherical Figure:
<foot>L 2 and</foot>
<p n=>76</p>
and I in$tance in the Spherical Figure, that I might take that which
is contained under the lea$t Superficies, and therefore le$$e $ubject
to Retardment. Another $hall be, touching the Vibrations of Pen-
dulums, and this hath many heads: One $hall be, Whether all,
both Great, Mean, and Little, are made really and preci$ely under
equal Times: And another, What is the proportion of the Times
of Moveables, $u$pended at unequal $trings, of the Times of their
Vibrations I mean.</P>
<P>SALV. The Que$tions are ingenious, and, like as it is incident
to all Truths, I $uppo$e, that, which ever of them we handle, it will
draw after it $o many other Truths, and curious Con$equences,
that I cannot tell whether the remainder of this day may $uffice
for the di$cu$$ing of them all.</P>
<P>SAGR. If they $hall be but as delightful as the precedent, it
would be more grateful for me to employ as many daies, not to $ay,
hours, as it is unto night, and I believe that <I>Simplicius</I> will not be
cloy'd with $uch Argumentations as the$e.</P>
<P>SIMP. No certainly: and e$pecially, when the Que$tions trea-
ted of are Phy$ical, touching which we read not the Opinions or
Di$cour$es of other Philo$ophers.</P>
<marg><I>Any Body, of any
Figure, Greatne$s,
and Gravity, is
checked by the Re-
nitence of the</I> Me-
dium, <I>though ne-
ver $o tenuous, in
$uch $ort, that the
Motion continuing,
it is reduced to
equability.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. I come therefore to the fir$t, affirming without any
h&aelig;$itation, that there is not a Sphere $o big, nor of Matter $o grave,
but that the Renitence of the <I>Medium,</I> though very tenuous, checks
its Acceleration, and in the continuation of the Motion reduceth
it to Equability, of which we may draw a very clear Argument
from Experience it $elf. For if any falling Moveable were able in
its continuation of Motion to attain any degree of Velocity, no
Velocity that $hould be conferred upon it, could be $o great but
that it would depo$e it, and free it $elf of it by help of the Impe-
diment of the <I>Medium.</I> And thus, a Cannon-bullet, that had de
$cended through the Air, <I>v. gr.</I> four yards, and had, for example,
acquired ten degrees of Velocity, and that with the$e $hould enter
into the Water, in ca$e the Impediment of the Water were not
able to prohibit $uch a certain <I>Impetus</I> in the Ball, it would en-
crea$e it, or at lea$t would continue it unto the bottom; which is
not ob$erved to en$ue: nay, the Water, although it were but a few
fathoms in depth, would impede and debilitate it in $uch a man-
ner, that it will make but a $mall impre$$ion in the bottom of the
River or Lake. It is therefore manife$t, that that Velocity, of
which the Water had ability to deprive it in a very $hort way,
would never be permitted to be acquired by it, though in a depth
of a thou$and Fathoms. And why $hould it be permitted to gain
it in a thou$and, to be taken from it again in four? What need we
more? Do we not $ee the immen$e <I>Impetus</I> of the Ball, $hot from
the Cannon it $elf, to be in $uch a manner flatted by the interpo-
<foot>$ition</foot>
<p n=>77</p>
$ition of a few Fathom of Water, that without any harm to the
Ship, it but very hardly reacheth to make a dent in it? The Air al-
$o, though very yielding, doth neverthele$$e repre$$e the Velocity
of the falling Moveable, although it be very heavy, as we may by
$uch like Experiments collect; for if from the top of a very high
Tower we $hould di$charge a Mu$quet downwards, this will make
a le$$er impre$$ion on the ground, than if we $hould di$charge the
Mu$quet at the height of four or $ix yards above the Plane: an
evident $ign, that the <I>Impetus,</I> wherewith the Bullet i$$ueth from
the Gun, di$charged on the top of the Tower, doth gradually di-
mini$h in de$cending thorow the Air: therefore the de$cending
from any what$oever great height will not $uffice to make it ac-
quire that <I>Impetus,</I> of which the Re$i$tance of the Air deprived
it, when it had in any manner been conferred upon it. The batte-
ry likewi$e that the force of a Bullet, $hot from a Culverin, $hall
make in a Wall at the di$tance of twenty Paces, would not, I be-
lieve, be $o great, if the Bullet was $hot perpendicularly from any
immen$e Altitude. I believe, therefore, that there is a Bound or
term belonging to the Acceleration of every Natural Moveable
that departs from Re$t, and that the Impediment of the <I>Medium</I> in
the end reduceth it to ^{*} Equality, in which it afterwards alwaies
<marg>* Or Equability.</marg>
continueth.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Experiments are really, in my opinion, much to
the purpo$e: nor doth any thing remain, unle$$e the Adver$ary
$hould fortifie him$elf, by denying, that they will hold true in great
and ponderous Ma$$es, and that a Cannon-bullet coming from the
Concave of the Moon, or from the upper Region of the Air,
would make a greater percu$$ion than coming from the Cannon.</P>
<P>SALV. There is no que$tion, but that many things may be
objected, and that they may not be all $alved by Experiments; ne-
verthele$$e in this contradiction, me thinks, there is $omething that
may fall under con$ideration; <I>$cilicet,</I> that it is very probable,
<marg><I>A Grave Body,
falling from an
Altitude, acqui-
reth $o much</I> Im-
petus <I>at its arri-
val to the ground,
as in all probabili-
ty, would $uffice to
recarry it to the
$ame height from
whence it fell.</I></marg>
that the Grave Body, falling from an Altitude, acquireth $o much
<I>Impetus,</I> at its arrival to the ground, as would $uffice to return it
to that height, as is plainly $een in a <I>Pendulum</I> rea$onable weighty,
that being removed fifty or $ixty degrees from the Perpendicular,
gaineth that Velocity and Virtue which exactly $ufficeth to force it
to the like Recur$ion, that little abated, which is taken from it by
the Impediment of the Air. To con$titute, therefore, the Cannon-
bullet in $uch an Altitude as may $uffice for the acqui$t of an <I>Impe-
tus,</I> as great as that which the Fire giveth it in its i$$uing from the
Piece, it would $uffice to $hoot it upwards perpendicularly with
the $aid Cannon, and then ob$erving, whether in its fall it maketh
an impre$$ion equal to that of the percu$$ion made near at hand in
its i$$uing forth; but, indeed, I believe, that it would not be any
<foot>whit</foot>
<p n=>78</p>
whit near $o forcible. And therefore I hold that the Velocity,
which the Bullet hath near to its going out of the Piece, would
be one of tho$e that the Impediment of the Air would never $uffer
it to acquire, whil$t it $hould with a natural Motion de$cend, leaving
the $tate of Re$t, from any great height. I come now to the other
Que$tions belonging to <I>Pendulums,</I> matters which to many would
$eem very frivolous, and more e$pecially to tho$e Philo$ophers that
are continually bu$ied in the more profound Que$tions of Natural
Philo$ophy: yet, notwith$tanding, will not I contemn them, being
encouraged by the Example of <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf, in whom I admire
this above all things; that he hath not, as one may $ay, omitted any
matter that any waies merited con$ideration, which he hath not
$poken of: and now upon the Que$tions you propounded, I think
I can tell you a certain conceit of mine upon $ome Problems con-
cerning Mu$ick, a noble Subject, of which $o many famous men,
and <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf, have written; and touching it, he con$ide-
reth many curious Problems: $o that if I likewi$e $hall from $o fa-

dents on the Argument of Sounds, I may hope that my di$cour$es
will be accepted by you.</P>

ally perform all its Vibrations, great, le$$er, and lea$t, under Times

of that, another $hall then make three Vibrations, when the $tring
of that $hall be nine times as long as the other. From whence doth

<P>SALV. Above all things, you are to know, that every <I>Pendu-
lum</I> hath the Time of its Vibrations $o limited, and prefixed, that
it is impo$$ible to make it move under any other Period, than that
onely one, which is natural unto it. Let any one take the $tring in
hand, to which the Weight is fa$tened, and trie all the wayes
he can to encrea$e or decrea$e the frequency of its Vibrations,
and he $hall finde it labour in vain: but we may, on the contrary,
on a <I>Pendulum,</I> though grave and at re$t, by onely blowing up-
on it, conferre a Motion, and a Motion con$iderably great, by
reiterating the bla$ts, but under the Time that is properly be-
longing to its Vibrations: for if at the fir$t bla$t we $hould have re-
moved it from Perpendicularity half an Inch, adding a $econd,
after that it being returned towards us, is ready to begin the $e-
cond Vibration, we $hould conferre new Motion on it, and $o
$ucce$$ively with other bla$ts, but given in Time, and not when
the <I>Pendulum</I> is comming towards us (for $o we $hould impede;
and not help the Motion) and $o continuing with many Impul-

propriety than this that I have premi$ed, doth $ute to render the
rea$on of the admirable Problem of the Chord of the Lute or Viol,
which moveth, and maketh not onely that really to $ound, which
is tuned to the Uni$on, but that al$o which is $et to an Eighth
and a Fifth. The Chord being toucht, its Vibrations begin, and
continue all the Time that its Sound is heard to endure: the$e
Vibrations make the Air neer adjacent to vibrate and tremble,
who$e tremblings and quaverings di$tend them$elves a great way,
and $trike upon all the Chords of the In$trument, and al$o of o-
<marg><I>Sundry Problems
touching Mu$ical
Proportions, and
their Solutions.</I></marg>
thers neer unto it: the Chord that is $et to an Uni$on, with that
which is toucht, being di$po$ed to make its Vibrations ^{*} in the
$ame Time, beginneth at the fir$t impul$e to move a little, and
<marg>* Or under.</marg>
a $econd, a third, a twentieth, and many more, overtaking it, all
in ju$t and Periodick Times, it receiveth at la$t, the $ame Tre-
mulation, with that fir$t touched, and one may clearly $ee it go,
dilating its Vibrations exactly according to the Pace of its Mo-
ver. This Undulation that di$tendeth it $elf thorow the Air, mo-
veth, and makes to vibrate, not onely the Chords, but likewi$e
any other Body di$po$ed to trembling, and to vibrate in the very
Time of the trembling Chord: $o that if we fix in the Sides of
the In$trument $everal $mall pieces of Bri$tles, or of other flexible
matters, you $hall $ee upon the $ounding of the Viol, now one,
now another of tho$e Corpu$cles tremble, according as that
Chord is toucht, who$e Vibrations return in the $ame Time: the
others will not move at the $triking of this Chord, nor will that
Bri$tle tremble at the $triking of another Chord. If with the Bow
one $martly $trike the Ba$e-Chord of a Viol, and $et a drinking
Gla$$e, thin and $mooth, neer unto it, if the Tone of the Chord
be an Uni$on to the Tone of the Gla$$e, the Gla$$e $hall dance,
and $en$ibly re-$ound. Again, the ample dilating of the Tremor
or Undulation of the <I>Medium</I> about the Body re$ounding, is ap-
parently $een in making the Gla$$e to $ound, by putting a little
Water in it, and then chafing the brim or edge of it with the tip
of the finger: for the included Water is ob$erved to undulate in
a mo$t regular order: and the $ame effect will be yet more clearly
$een, by $etting the foot of the Gla$$e in the bottom of a rea$o-
nable large Ve$$el, in which there is Water as high almo$t as to
the brim of the Gla$$e, for making it to $ound, as before, with
the Confrication of the finger, we $hall $ee the trembling of the
Water to diffu$e it $elf mo$t regularly, and with great Velocity,
to a great di$tance round about the Gla$$e; and it hath many
<foot>M times</foot>
<p n=>82</p>
times been my fortune, in making a rea$onable big Gla$$e, almo$t
full of Water, to $ound as afore$aid, to $ee the Waves in the
Water, at fir$t formed with an exact equality; and it hapning
$ometimes, that the Tone of the Gla$$e ri$eth an Eighth higher, at
the $ame in$tant, I have $een every one of the $aid Waves to divide
them$elves in two: an accident that very clearly proveth the
forme of the Octave to be the double.</P>
<P>SAGR. The $ame hath al$o befaln me more than once, to my
delight, and al$o benefit: for I $tood a long time perplexed a-
bout the$e Forms of Con$onants, not conceiving, that the Rea-
$on, commonly given thereof by the Authours that have hither-
to written learnedly of Mu$ick, were $ufficiently convincing,
they tell us, that the Diapa$on, that is the Eighth, is contained
by the double, the Diapente, which we call the Fifth, by the
Se$quialter: for a Chord being di$tended on the ^{*} Monochord,
<marg>* An In$trument
of but one $tring;
called by <I>Mar-
$ennus la Tromper-
te Marine.</I></marg>
$triking it all; and afterwards $triking but the half of it, by pla-
cing a Bridge in the middle, one heareth an Eighth; and if the
Bridge be placed at a third of the whole Chord, touching the
whole, and then the two thirds, it $oundeth a Fifth; whereupon
they infer, that the Eighth is contained between two and one, and
the Fifth between three and two. This Rea$on, I $ay, $eemed to
me not nece$$arily concluding for the a$$igning ju$tly the double
and the Se$quialter, for the natural Forms of the Diapa$on and
the Diapente. And that which moved me $o to think, was this.
There are three ways, by which we may $harpen the Tone of a
Chord: one is, by making it $horter, the other is by di$tending;
or making it more ten$e; and the third is by making it thinner. If,
retaining the $ame Tention and thickne$$e, we would hear an
Eighth, it is nece$$ary to $horten it to one half, which is done by
$triking it all, and then half. But if, retaining the $ame length
and thickne$$e, we would have it ri$e to an Eighth, by $crewing
it higher, it will not $uffice to $tretch it double as much, but we
$hall need the quadruple, $o that, if before it was $tretched by a
Weight of one pound, it will be needful to fa$ten four pound
to it to $harpen it to an Eighth. And la$tly, if, keeping the $ame
length and Tention, we would have a Chord, that by being $mal-
ler, rendereth an Eighth, it will be nece$$ary, that it retain onely
a fourth part of the thickne$$e of the other more Grave. And this
which I $peak of the Eighth, that is, that its form taken from the
Tention, or from the thickne$$e of the Chord, is in duplicate
proportion to that which it receiveth from the length, is to be
under$toood of all other Mu$ical Intervals: for that which the
length giveth us in a Se$quialter proportion, <I>i. e.</I> by $triking it all,
and then the two thirds, if you would have it proceed from the
Tention, or from the di$gro$$ing, you mu$t double the Se$qui-
<foot>alter</foot>
<p n=>83</p>
alter proportion, taking the double Se$quiquartan: and if the
Grave Chord were $tretched by four pound weight, fa$ten to the
Acute not $ix, but nine: and, as to the thickne$$e, make the Grave
Chord thicker than the Acute, according to the proportion of
nine to four, to have the Fifth. The$e being mo$t exact Experi-
ments, I thought, that I $aw no rea$on, why the$e Sage Philo$o-
phers $hould e$tabli$h the form of the Eighth to be rather the dou-
ble, than quadruple; and the Form of the Fifth to be rather the
Se$quialter, than the double Se$quiquartan. But becau$e the
numbring of the Vibrations of a Chord, which in giving a $ound,
are extreme frequent, is altogether impo$$ible, I $hould always
have been in doubt, whether or no it were true, that the more
Acute Chord of the Eighth, made in the $ame time, double the
number of the Vibrations of the more Grave, if the Waves,
which may be continued as long as you plea$e, by making the
Gla$s to $ound and vibrate, had not $en$ibly $hewn me, that in
the $elf $ame moment that ($ometimes) the Sound is heard to ri$e
to an Eighth, there are $een to ari$e other Waves more minute,
which with infinite $moothne$s cut in the middle each of tho$e
fir$t.</P>
<P>SALV. An excellent Ob$ervation for di$tingui$hing one by

$ounding Body: which are tho$e that diffu$ing them$elves tho-
row the Air, make the titillation upon the Drum of our Ear, that
in our Soul becommeth a Sound: But whereas beholding and ob-
$erving them in the Water, endure no longer than the confrica-
tion of the finger la$teth, and al$o in that time they are not per-
manent, but are continually made and di$$olved, would it not
be an ingenious undertaking, if one could make, with much
exqui$itene$$e, $uch, as would continue a long time; I mean
Moneths and Years, $o as to give a man opportunity mea$ure,
and with ea$e to number them?</P>
<P>SAGR. I a$$ure you I $hould highly value $uch an Invention.</P>
<P>SALV. The di$covery was accidental, and the Ob$ervation
and applicative improvement of it onely were mine, and I hold
it to be a Circum$tance of noble Contemplation, althongh a bu$i-
ne$$e in its $elf $ufficiently homely. Scraping a Bra$$e Plate with
an Iron Chizzel to fetch out $ome Spots, in moving the Chizzel to
and again upon it pretty quick, I heard it (once or twice among$t
many gratings) to Sibilate and $end forth a whi$tling noi$e, very
$hrill and audible: and looking upon the Plate, I $aw a long
row of $mall $treaks, parallel to one another, and di$tant from
one another by mo$t equal Intervals: returning to my $craping
again, I perceived by $everal trials, that in tho$e $crapings, and
tho$e onely that whi$tled, the Chizzel left the $treaks upon the
<foot>M 2 Plate:</foot>
<p n=>84</p>
Plate: but when the Scraping pa$$ed without any Sibilation,
there was not $o much as the lea$t $ign of any $uch $treaks. Re-
peating the Experiment $everal times afterwards, $craping now
with greater, now with le$$e velocity, the Sibilation hapned to
be of a Tone $ometimes acuter, $ometimes graver; and I ob$erved
the marks made in the more acute $ounds to be clo$er together,
and tho$e of the more grave farther a$under: and $ometimes al$o,
according as the $elf $ame $crape was made towards the end, with
greater velocity than at the beginning, the $ound was heard to
grow $harper, and the $treaks were ob$erved to $tand thicker,
but ever with extream neatne$$e, and marked with exact equidi-
$tance: and farther-more, in the Sibilating $crapes; I felt the
Chizzel to $hake or tremulate in my hand, and a certain chilne$$e
to run along my arm; and in $hort, I $aw the $ame effected upon
the Toole, which we u$e to ob$erve in whi$pering, and after-
wards $peaking aloud, for $ending forth the breath without
forming a $ound, we do not perceive any moving in the throat
and mouth, in compari$on of that which we di$cern to be in the
Wind-pipe and Throat of every one, in $ending forth the voice;
and e$pecially in grave and loud Tones. I have likewi$e $ome-
times among$t the Chords of the Viols, ob$erved two that were
Uni$ons to the Sibilations made by $craping after the manner I
told you, and that were mo$t different in Tone, from which two
they preci$ely were di$tant a perfect Fifth, and then mea$uring
the intervals of the $treaks of both the Scrapes, I $aw the di-
$tance that conteined forty five $paces of the one, conteined
thirty of the other: which, indeed, is the Form attributed to the
Diapente. But here, before I proceed any farther, I will tell you,
that of the three manners of rendring a Sound Acute, that which
you refer to the $lenderne$$e or finene$$e of the Chord, may
with more truth be a$cribed to the Weight. For the alteration ta-
ken from the thickne$$e, an$wereth, when the Chords are of the
$ame matter; and $o a Gut-$tring to make an Eighth, ought to be
four times thicker than the other Gut-$tring; and one of Wier four
times thicker than another of Wier. But if I would make an Eighth
with one of Wier to one of Gut-$tring, I am not to make it four
times thicker, but four times graver, $o that, as to thickne$$e,
this of Wier $hall not be four times thicker, but quadruple in
Gravity, for $ome times it $hall be more $mall than its re$pon-
dent to the Acuter Eighth, that is of Gut-$tring. Hence it com-
meth to pa$$e that, $tringing an In$trument with Chords of Gold,
and another with Chords of Bra$$e, if they $hall be of the $ame
length, thickne$$e, and Tention, Gold being almo$t twice as
heavy, the Strings $hall prove about a Fifth more Grave. And
here it is to be noted, that the Gravity of the Moveable more re-
<foot>$i$teth</foot>
<p n=>85</p>
$i$teth the Velocity, than the thickne$$e doth; contrary to what
others at the fir$t would think: for indeed, in appearance, its more
rea$onable, that the Velocity $hould be retarded by the Re$i$tance
of the <I>Medium</I> again$t Opening in a Moveable thick and light,
than in one grave and $lender: and yet in this ca$e it happeneth
quite contrary. But pur$uing our fir$t Intent, I $ay, That the
ncere$t and immediate rea$ons of the Forms of Mu$ical Intervals,
is neither the length of the Chord, nor the Tention, nor the
thickne$$e, but the proportion of the numbers of the Vibrations,
and Percu$$ions of the Undulations of the Air that beat upon the
Drum of our Ear, which it $elf al$o doth tremulate under the
$ame mea$ures of Time. Having e$tabli$hed this Point, we may,
perhaps, a$$ign a very apt rea$on, whence it commeth, that of
tho$e Sounds that are different in Tone, $ome Couples are re-
ceived with great delight by our Sence, others with le$s, and
others occa$ion in us a very great di$turbance; which is to $eek a
rea$on of the Con$onances more or le$$e perfect, and of Di$lo-
nances. The mole$tation and har$hne$$e of the$e proceeds, as I
believe, from the di$cordant Pul$ations of two different Tones,
which di$proportionally $trike the Drum of our Ear: and the
Di$$onances $hall be extreme har$h, in ca$e the Times of the Vi-
brations were incommen$urable. For one of which take that,
when of two Chords $et to an Uni$on, one is $ounded, and $uch
a part of another, as is the Side of the Square of its Diameter;
a Di$$onance like to the ^{*} Tritone, or Semi-diapente. Con$onan-
<marg>* Or a fal$e Fifth.</marg>
ces, and with plea$ure received, $hall tho$e Couples of Sounds
be, that $hall $trike in $ome order upon the Drum; which order
requireth, fir$t, that the Pul$ations made in the $ame Time be
commen$urable in number, to the end, the Cartillage of the Drum,
may not $tand in the perpetual Torment of a double inflection of
allowing and obeying the ever di$agreeing Percu$$ions. Therefore
the fir$t and mo$t grateful Con$onance $hall be the Eighth, being,
that for every $troke, that the Grave-$tring or Chord giveth upon
the Drum, the Acute giveth, two; $o that both beat together
in every $econd Vibration of the Acute Chord; and $o of the
whole number of $trokes, the one half accord to $trike together,
but the $trokes of the Chords that are Uni$ons, alwayes joyn
both together, and therefore they are, as if they were of the
$ame Chord, nor make they a Con$onance. The Fifth delighteth
likewi$e, in regard, that for every two $troaks of the Grave
Chord, the Acute giveth three: from whence it followeth, that
numbering the Vibrations of the Acute Chord, the third part of
that number will agree to beat together; that is, two Solitary ones
interpo$e between every couple of Con$onances; and in the Di-
ate$$eron there interpo$e three. In the $econd, that is in the <I>Se$-</I>
<foot><I>quioctave</I></foot>
<p n=>86</p>
<I>quioctave</I> Tone for every nine Pul$ations, one onely $trikes in Con-
$ort with the other of the Graver Chord; all the re$t are Di$cords,
and received upon the Drum with regret, and are judged Di$$o-
nances by the Ear.</P>
<P>SIMP. I could wi$h this Di$cour$e were a little explained.</P>
<P>SALV. Suppo$e this line A B the Space, and dilating of a Vi-
bration of the Grave Chord; and the line C D that of the Acute
Chord, which with the other giveth the Eighth: and let A B be
divided in the mid$t in E. It is manife$t, that the Chords begin-
ing to move at the terms A and C, by that time the Acute Vibra-
tion $hall be come to the term D, the other
<fig>
$hall be di$tended onely to the half E, which
not being the bound or term of the Motion,
it $trikes not: but yet a $troak is made in D.
The Vibrations afterwards returning from D
to C, the other pa$$eth from E to B, where-
upon the two Percu$$ions of B and C $trike
both together upon the Drum: and $o con-
tinuing to reiterate the like $ub$equent Vi-
brations; one $hall $ee, that the union of the
Percu$$ions of the Vibrations C D with tho$e of A B, happen al-
ternately every other time: but the Pullations of the terms A B
are alwayes accompanied with one of C D, and that alwayes the
$ame: which is manife$t, for $uppo$ing that A and C $trike to-
gether; in the time that A is pa$$ing to B, C goeth to D, and
returneth back to C: $o that the $troaks at B and C are al$o
together. But now let the two Vibrations A B and C D be tho$e
that produce the Diapente, the times of which are in proportion
Se$quialter, and divide A B of the Grave Chord, in three equal
parts in E and O; And $uppo$e the Vibrations to begin at the
$ame moment from the terms A and C: It is manife$t, that at the
$troke that $hall be made in D, the Vibration of A B $hall have
got no farther than O, the Drum therefore receiveth the Pul$a-
tion D onely: again in the return from D to C, the other Vibra-
tion pa$$eth from O to B, and returneth to O, making the Pul-
$ation in B, which likewi$e is $olitary, and in Counter-time, (an
accident to be con$idered:) for we having $uppo$ed the fir$t
Pul$ations to be made at the $ame moment in the terms A and C,
the $econd, which was onely by the term D, was made as long after
as the time of the tran$ition C D, that is A O, imports; but
that which followeth, made in B, is di$tant from the other one-
ly $o much as is the time O B, which is the half: afterwards con-
tinuing the Recur$ion from O to A, whil$t the other goeth from
C to D, the two Pul$ations come to be made both at once in A
and D. There afterwards follow other Periods like to the$e, that
<foot>is,</foot>
<p n=>87</p>
is, with the interpo$ition of two $ingle and $olitary Pul$ations of
the Acute Chord, and one of the Grave Chord, likewi$e $olita-
ry, is interpo$ed between the two $olitary $trokes of the Acute. So
that if we did but $uppo$e the Time divided into Moments, that is,
into $mall equal Particles: $uppo$ing that in the two fir$t moments,
I pa$$ed from the Concordant Pul$ations made in A and C to O
and D, and that in D, I make a Percu$$ion: and that in the third
and fourth moment I return from D to C, $triking in C, and
that from O, I pa$t to B, and returned to O, $triking in B; and
that la$tly in the fifth and $ixth moment from O and C, I pa$t to
A and D $triking in both: we $hall have the Pul$ations di$tributed
with $uch order upon the Drum, that $uppo$ing the Pul$ations of
the two Chords in the $ame in$tant, it $hall two moments after
receive a $olitary Percu$$ion, in the third moment anothor, $oli-
tary likewi$e, in the fourth another $ingle one, and two moments
after, that is, in the $ixth, two together; and here ends the
Period, and, if I may $o $ay, Anomaly; which Period is oft-times
afterwards replicated.</P>
<P>SAGR. I can hold no longer, but mu$t needs expre$$e the con-
tent I take in hearing rea$ons $o appo$itely a$$igned of effects that
have $o long time held me in darkne$$e and blindne$$e. Now I
know why the Uni$on differeth not at all from a $ingle Tone: I
$ee why the Eighth is the principal Con$onance, but withal $o
like to an Uni$on, that, as an Uni$on, it is taken and cojoyned
with others: it re$embleth an Uni$on, for that whereas the Pul-
$ations of Chords $et to an Uni$on, keep time in $triking, the$e
of the Grave Chord in an Eighth alwayes keep time with tho$e
of the Acute, and of the$e one interpo$eth alone, and in equal
di$tances, and as, one may $ay, without any variety, whereupon
that Con$onance is over $weet. But the Fifth, with tho$e its
Counter-times, and with the interpo$ures of two $olitary Pul$a-
tions of the Acute Chord, and one of the Grave Chord,
between the Couples of Di$cordant Pul$ations, and tho$e
three $olitary ones, with an interval of time, as great as the half of
that which interpo$eth between each Couple, and the $olitary
Percu$$ions of the Acute Chord, maketh $uch a Titillation and
Tickling upon the Cartillage of the Drum of the Ear, that al-
laying the Dulcity with a mixture of Acrimony, it $eemeth at
one and the $ame time to ki$$e and bite.</P>
<P>SALV. It is convenient, in regard I $ee, that you take $uch de-
light in the$e Novelties, that I $hew you the way whereby the Eye
al$o, and not the Ear alone, may recreate it $elf in beholding
the $ame $ports that the Ear feeleth. Su$pend Balls of Lead or o-
ther heavy matter on three $trings of different lengths, but in
$uch proportion, that while the longer maketh two Vibrations,
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>88</p>
the $horter may make four, and the middle one three; which
will happen, when the longe$t containeth $ixteen feet, or other
mea$ures, of which the middle one containeth nine, and the
$horte$t four: and removing them all together from Perpendi-
cularity, and then letting them go, you $hall $ee a plea$ing In-
termixtion of the $aid <I>Pendulums</I> with various encounters, but
$uch, that, at every fourth Vibration of the longe$t, all the three
will concurre in one and the $ame term together, and then again
will depart from it, reiterating anew the $ame Period: the which
commixture of Vibrations, is the $ame, that being made by the
Chords, pre$ents to the Ear an Eighth, with a Fifth in the mid$t.
And if you qualifie the length of other $trings in the like di$po-
$ure, $o that their Vibrations an$wer to tho$e of other Mu$ical,
but Con$onant Intervals, you $hall $ee other and other Inter-
weavings, and alwaies $uch, that in determinate times, and after
determinate numbers of Vibrations, all the $trings (be they three,
or be they four) will agree to joyn in the $ame moment, in the
term of their Recur$ions, and from thence to begin $uch another
Period: but if the Vibrations of two or more $trings are either
Incommen$urable, $o, that they never return harmoniou$ly to ter-
minate determinate numbers of Vibrations, or though they be
not Incommen$urable, yet if they return not till after a long time,
and after a great number of Vibrations, then the $ight is con-
founded in the di$orderly order of irregular Intermixtures, and
the Ear with wearine$$e and regret receiveth the intemperate Im-
pul$es of the Airs Tremulations, that without Order or Rule,
$ucce$$ively beat upon its Drum.</P>

many Digre$$ions as held us the whole day, and far from the
<foot>N matter</foot>
<p n=>90</p>
matter at fir$t propo$ed, which was the Contemplation of the Re-
$i$tances of Solids to Fraction.</P>
<P>SALV. I remember all that hath been $aid, and returning to
our begun di$cour$e; What ever this Re$i$tance of Solids to brea-
king by a violent attraction, is $uppo$ed to be, it is $ufficient, that it
is to be found in them: which, though it be very great again$t the
$trength of one that draweth them $treight out, it is ob$erved to be
le$$e in forcing them tran$ver$ely, or $idewaies: and thus we $ee,
for example, a rod of Steel, or Gla$$e to $u$tain the length-waies a
weight of a thou$and pounds, which, fa$tned at Right-Angles in-
to a Wall, will break if you hang upon it but only fifty. And of
this $econd Re$i$tance we are to $peak, enquiring, according to
what proportions it is found in Pri$mes, and Cylinders of like and
unlike figure, length, and thickne$s, and, withal, of the $ame mat-
ter. In which Speculation, I take for a known Principle, that which
in the Mechanicks is demon$trated among$t the Pa$$ions of the
Vectis, which we call the Leaver: namely, That in that u$e of the
Leaver, the Force is to the Re$i$tance in Reciprocal proportion,
as the Di$tances from the Fulciment to the $aid Force and the Re-
$i$tance.</P>
<P>SIMP. This <I>Ari$totle,</I> in his Mechanicks, demon$trated before
any other man.</P>
<P>SALV. I am content to grant him the precedency in time, but
for the firmne$$e o$ Demon$tration, I think, that <I>Archimedes</I>
ought to be preferred far before him, on one $ole Propo$ition of
whom, by him demon$trated in his Book, <I>De Equiponderantium,</I>
depend the Rea$ons, not only of the Leaver, but of the greater
part of the other Mechanick In$truments.</P>
<P>SAGR. But $ince that this Principle is the foundation of all
that which you intend to demon$trate to us, it would be very re-
qui$ite, that you produce us the proof of this $ame Suppo$ition,
if it be not too long a work, giving us a full and perfect informati-
on thereof.</P>
<P>SALV. Though I am to do this, yet it will be better, that I lead
you into the field of all our future Speculations, by an enterance
$omewhat different from that of <I>Archimedes</I>; and that, $uppo-
$ing no more, but only that equal Weights, put into a Ballance of
equal Arms, make an <I>Equilibrium,</I> (a Principle likewi$e $uppo$ed
by <I>Archimedes</I> him$elf.) I come, in the next place, to demon-
$trate to you, that not only it is as true as the other, That unequal
Weights make an <I>Equilibrium</I> in a Stiliard of Armes unequal, ac-
cording to the proportion of tho$e Weights Reciprocally $u$pen-
ded, but that it is one and the $ame thing to place equal Weights
at equal di$tances, as to place unequal Weights at di$tances that
are in Reciprocal Proportion to the Weights. Now for a plain
<foot>Demon-</foot>
<p n=>91</p>
Demon$tration of what I $ay, de$cribe a Solid Pri$m or Cylinder
A B, [<I>as in</I> Figure 1. <I>at the end of this Dialogue,</I>] $u$pended by
its ends at the Line H I, and $u$tained by two Cords, H A, and I B.
It is manife$t, that if I $u$pend the whole by the Cord C, placed
in the middle of the Beam or Ballance H I, the Pri$m A B will be
equilibrated, one half of its weight, being on one $ide, and the other
half on the other $ide of the Point of Su$pen$ion C by the Princi-
ple that we pre$uppo$ed. Now let the Pri$m be divided into un-
equal parts by the Line D, and let the part D A be grea-
ter, and D B le$$er; and to the end, that $uch divi$ion being made,
the Parts of the Pri$m may re$t in the $ame $cituation and con$ti-
tution, in re$pect of the Line H I, let us help it with a Cord E D,
which, being fa$tened in the Point E, $u$taineth the parts A D, and
D B: It is not to be doubted, but that there being no local muta-
tion in the Pri$m, in re$pect of the Ballance H I, it $hall remain in
the $ame $tate of Equilibration. But it will re$t in the $ame Con-
$titution likewi$e, if the Part of the Pri$m, that is now $u$pended at
the two extreams, or ends with Cords A H and D E, be hanged at
one $ole Cord G L, placed in the mid$t: and likewi$e the other
part D B, will not change $tate, if $u$pended by the middle, and
$u$tained by the Cord F M. So that the Cords H A, E D, and I B
being untied, and only the two Cords G L, and F M being left, the
<I>Equilibrium</I> will $till remain, the Su$pen$ion being $till made at
the Point C. Now, here let us confider, that we have two Grave
Bodies A D, and D B, hanging at the terms G and F of a Beam
G F, in which the <I>Equilibrium</I> is made at the Point C: in $uch
manner, that the di$tance of the $u$pen$ion of the Weight A D
from the Point C, is the Line C G, and the other part C F, is the
di$tance at which the other Weight D B hangeth. It remaineth,
therefore, only to be demon$trated, that tho$e Di$tances have the
$ame proportion to one another, as the Weights them$elves have,
but reciprocally taken: that is, that the di$tance G C is to the di-
$tance C F, as the Pri$m D B to the Pri$m D A, which we prove
thus. The Line G E being the half of E H, and E F the half of
E I, all G F $hall be equall to all H I, and therefore equal to C I:
and taking away the common part C F, the remainder G C $hall
be equal to the remainder F I, that is, to F E: and C E taken in
common, the two Lines G E and C F $hall be equal: and, there-
fore, as G E, is to E F, $o is F C, to C G: but as G C is to E F, $o is
the double to the double; that is H E to E I; that is, the Pri$m
A D to the Pri$m D B. Therefore by Equality of proportion,
and by Conver$ion, as the di$tance G C is to the di$tance C F, $o
is the Weight B D to the Weight D A: which is that that I was to
demon$trate. If you under$tand this, I believe that you will not
$cruple to admit, that the two Pri$mes A D, and D B make an
<foot>N 2 <I>Equili-</I></foot>
<p n=>92</p>
<I>Equilibrium</I> in th Point C, for the half of the whole Solid A B is
on the right hand of the Su$pen$ion C, and the other half on the
left; and that in this manner there are repre$ented two equal
Weights, di$po$ed and di$tended at two equal di$tances. Again,
that the two Pri$mes A D, and D B, being reduced into two Dice,
or two Balls, or into any two other Figures, (provided that they
keep the $ame Su$pen$ions G and F) do continue to make their
<I>Equilibrium</I> in the Point C, I believe none can deny, for that it is
mo$t manife$t, that Figures change not weight, where the $ame
quantity of matter is retained. From which we may gather the
general Conclu$ion, That two Weights, whatever they be, make
an <I>Equilibrium</I> at Di$tances reciprocally an$wering to their Gra-
vities. This Principle, therefore, being e$tabli$hed, before we pa$s
any farther, I am to propo$e to Con$ideration, how the$e Forces,
Re$i$tances, Moments, Figures, may be con$idered in Ab$tract,
and $eparate from Matter, as al$o in Concrete and conjoyned
with Matter; and in this manner tho$e Accidents that agree with
Figures, con$idered as Immaterial, $hall receive certain Modifica-
tions, when we $hall come to add Matter to them, and con$equent-
ly Gravity. As for example, if we take a Leaver, as for in$tance
B A [<I>as in</I> Fig. 2.] which, re$ting upon the Fulciment E, we ap-
ply to rai$e the heavy Stone D: It is manife$t by the Principle de-
mon$trated, that the Force placed at the end B, $hall $uffice to
equal the Re$i$tance of the Weight D, if $o be, that its Moment
have the $ame proportion to the Moment of the $aid D, that the
Di$tance A C hath to the Di$tance C B: and this is true, if we
confider no other Moments than tho$e of the $imple Force in B,
and of the Re$i$tance in D, as if the $aid Leaver were immaterial,
and void of Gravity. But if we bring to account the Gravity al$o
of the In$trument or Leaver it $elf, which hapneth $ometimes to be
of Wood, and $ometimes of Iron; it is manife$t, that the weight
of the Leaver, being added to the Force in B, it will alter the pro-
portion, which it will be requi$ite to deliver in other terms. And
therefore before we pa$$e any farther, it is nece$$ary, that we di-
$tingui$h between the$e two waies of Con$ideration, calling that a
taking it ab$olutely, when we $uppo$e the In$trument to be taken
in Ab$tract, that is, disjunct from the Gravity of its own Matter;
but conjoyning the Matter, as al$o the Gravity, with $imple and
ab$olute Figures, we will phra$e the Figures conjoyn'd with the
Matter, Moment, or Force compounded.</P>
<P>SAGR I mu$t of nece$$ity break the Re$olution I had taken,
not to give occa$ion of digre$$ing, for I $hould not be able to $et
my $elf to hear what remaines with attention, if a certain $cruple
were not removed that cometh into my head; and it is this, That
I gue$$e you make compari$on between the Force placed in B, and
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>93</p>
the total Gravity of the Stone D, of which Gravity me thinks, that
one, and that, very probably, the greater part, re$teth upon the
Plane of the Horizon: $o that----</P>
<P>SALV. I have rightly apprehended you, $o that you need $ay
no more, but only take notice, that I named not the total Gravity
of the Stone, but $pake of the Moment that it hath, and exerci$eth
at the Point A, the extream term of the Leaver B A, which is ever
le$s than the entire weight of the Stone; and is variable according
to the Figure of the Stone, and according as it hapneth to be more
or le$$e elevated.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am $atisfied in that particular, but I have one thing
more to de$ire, namely, that for my perfect information, you would
demon$trate to me the way, if there be one, how I may find what
part of the total weight that is, which cometh to be born by the
$ubjacent Plane, and what that which gravitates upon the Leaver
at the extream A.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. Becau$e I can give you $atisfaction in few words, I will
not fail to $erve you: therefore, de$cribing a $light Figure thereof,
be plea$ed to $uppo$e, that the Weight, who$e Center of Gravity is
A, [<I>as in</I> Fig. 3.] re$teth upon the Horizon with the term B, and
at the other end is born up by the Leaver C G, on the Fulciment
N, by a Power placed in G: and that from the Center A, and term
C, Perpendiculars be let fall to the Horizon, A O, and C F. I $ay,
That the Moment of the whole Weight $hall have to the Moment
of the whole Power in G, a proportion compounded of the Di-
$tance G N to the Di$tance N C, and of F B to B O. Now, as the
Line F B is to B O, $o let N C be to X. And the whole Weight A
being born by the two Powers placeed in B and C, the Power B is
to C, as the di$tance F O to O B: and by Compo$ition, the
two Powers B and C together, that is, the total Moment of
the whole Weight A, is to the Power in C, as the Line F B is
to the Line B O; that is, as N C to X: But the Moment of
the Power in C is to the Moment of the Power in G, as the Di-
$tance G N is to N C: Therefore, by Perturbation of proportion,
the whole Weight A is to the Moment of the Power in G, as G N
to X: But the proportion of G N to X is compounded of the pro-
portion G N to N C, and of that of N C to X; that is, of F B to
B O: Therefore the Weight A is to the Power that bears it up in
G, in a proportion compounded of G N to N C, and of that of
F B to B O: which is that that was to be demon$trated. Now re-
turning to our fir$t intended Argument, all things hitherto decla-
red being under$tood, it will not be hard to know the rea$on,
whence it cometh to pa$$e that</P>

<p n=>94</p>
<head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
<P><I>A Solid Pri$m or Cylinder of Gla$$e, Steel, Wood, or
other Frangible Matter, that being $u$pended length-
waies, will $u$tain a very great Weight hanged
Thereat, will, Sidewaies, (as we $aid even now) be
broken in pieces by a far le$$er Weight, according as
its length $hall exceed its thickne$s.</I></P>
<P>Wherefore let us de$cribe the Solid Pri$m A B C D,
fixed into a Wall by the Part A B, and in the
other extream $uppo$e the Force of the Weight E;
(alwaies under$tanding the Wall to be erect to the Horizon,
and the Pri$m or Cylinder fa$tened in the Wall at Right-An-
gles) it is manife$t, that being to break, it will be broken in the place
B, where the Mortace in the Wall $erveth for Fulciment, and B C
for the part of the Leaver in which lieth the force, and the thick-
ne$$e of the Solid B A is the other part of the Leaver, in which
lieth the Re$i$tance, which con$i$teth in the unfa$tening, or divi-
ding, that is to be made of the part of the Solid B D, that is with-
out the Wall from that which is within: and by what hath been
declared, the Moment
<fig>
of the Force placed in
C, is to the Moment of
the Re$i$tance that lieth
in the thickne$$e of the
Pri$m, that is, in the
Connection of the Ba$e
B A, with the parts con-
tiguous to it, as the
length C B is to the half
of B A: And therefore
the ab$olute Re$i$tance
again$t Fraction that is
in the Pri$m B D,
(which ab$olute Re$i-
$tance is that which is
made by drawing it
downwards, for at that
time the motion of the Mover is the $ame with that of the Body
Moved) again$t the fracture to be made by help of the Leaver
<foot>B C,</foot>
<p n=>95</p>
B C, is as the Length B C to the half of A B in the Pri$m, which
in the Cylinder is the Semidiameter of its Ba$e. And this is our fir$t
Propo$ition. And ob$erve, that what I have $aid ought to be un-
der$tood, when the Confideration of the proper Weight of the So-
lid B D is removed: which Solid I have taken as weighing nothing.
But in ca$e we would bring its Gravity to account, conjoyning it
with the Weight E, we ought to add to the Weight E the half of
the Weight of the Solid B D: $o that the Weight B D being
<I>v. gr.</I> two pounds, and the Weight of E ten pounds, we are to
take the Weight E, as if it were eleven pounds.</P>
<P>SIMP. And why not as if it were twelve?</P>
<P>SALV. The Weight E, <I>Simplicius,</I> hanging at the term C,
gravitates in re$pect of B C, with all its Moment of ten pounds,
whereas if only B D were pendent, it would weigh with its whole
Moment of two pounds; but, as you $ee, that Solid is di$tributed
thorow all the length B C, uniformly, $o that its parts near to the
extream B, gravitate le$$e than the more remote: $o that, in a word,
compen$ating tho$e with the$e, the weight of the whole Pri$m is
brought to operate under the Center of its Gravity, which an$we-
reth to the middle of the Leaver B C: But a Weight hanging at
the end C, hath a Moment double to that which it would have
hanging at the middle: And therefore the half of the Weight of
the Pri$m ought to be added to the Weight E, when we would u$e
the Moment of both, as placed in the Term C.</P>
<P>SIMP. I apprehend you very well, and, if I deceive not my $elf,
me thinks, that the Power of both the Weights B D and E, $o placed,
would have the $ame Moment, as if the whole Weight of B D, and
the double of E were hanged in the mid$t of the Leaver B C.</P>
<P>SALV. It is exactly $o, and you are to bear it in mind. Here we
may immediatly under$tand</P>
<head>PROPOSITION II.</head>
<P><I>How, and with what proportion, a Ruler, or Pri$m,
more broad than thick, re$i$teth Fraction, better if it
be forced according to its breadth, than according to
its thickne$$e.</I></P>
<P>For under$tanding of which, let a Pri$m be $uppo$ed A D:
[<I>as in</I> Fig. 4.] who$e breadth is A C, and its thickne$s much
le$$er C B: It is demanded, why we would attempt to break
it edge-waies, as in the fir$t Figure it will re$i$t the great Weight
T, but placed flat-waies, as in the $econd Figure, it will not re$i$t
<foot>X, le$-</foot>
<p n=>96</p>
X, le$$er than T: Which is manife$ted, $ince we under$tand the
Fulciment, one while under the Line B C, and another while under
C A, and the Di$tances of the Forces to be alike in both Ca$es, to
wit, the length <I>B</I> D. But in the fir$t Ca$e, the Di$tance of the Re-
$i$tance from the Fulciment, which is the half of the Line C A, is
greater than the Di$tance in the other Ca$e, which is the half of B
C: Therefore the Force of the Weight T, mu$t of nece$$ity be grea-
ter than X, as much as the half of the breadth C A is greater than
half the thichne$$e B C, the fir$t $erving for the Counter-Leaver of
C A, and the $econd of C B to overcome the $ame Re$i$tance, that
is the quantity of the <I>Fibres,</I> or $trings of the whole Ba$e A B.
Conclude we therefore, that the $aid Pri$m or Ruler, which is
broader than it is thick, re$i$teth, bresking more the edge-waies
than the flat-waies, according to the Proportion of the breadth to
the thickne$s.</P>
<P>It is requi$ite that we begin in the next place</P>
<head>PROPOSITION III.</head>
<P><I>To find according to what proportion the encrea$e of the
Moment of the proper Gravity is made in a Pri$m
or Cylinder, in relation to the proper Re$i$tance
again$t Fraction, whil$t that being parallel to the
Horizon, it is made longer and longer: Which Mo-
ment I find to encrea$e $ucce$sively in duplicate Pro-
portion to that of the prolongation.</I></P>
<P>For demon$tration whereof, de$cribe the Pri$m or Cylin-
der A D, firmly fa$tned in the Wall at the end A, and let
it be equidi$tant from the Horizon, and let the $ame be
under$tood to be prolonged as far as E, adding thereto the part
<I>B</I> E. It is manife$t, that the prolongation of the Leaver A <I>B</I>
to C encrea$eth, by it $elf alone, that is taken ab$olutely, the
Moment of the Force pre$$ing again$t the Re$i$tance of the
Separation and Rupture to be made in A, according to the pro-
portion of C A to <I>B</I> A: but, moreover, the Weight of the Solid
affixed <I>B</I> E, encrea$eth the Moment of the pre$$ing Gravity of
the Weight of the Solid A <I>B,</I> according to the Proportion of
the Pri$m A E to the Pri$m A <I>B</I>; which proportion is the $ame
as that of the length A C, to the length A <I>B</I>: Therefore it is clear
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>97</p>
that the two augmentations of the Lengths and of the Gravities
being put together, the Moment compounded of both is in double
<fig>
proportion to ei-
ther of them. We
conclude there-
fore, That the Mo-
ments of the For-
ces of Pri$mes and
Cylinders of equal
thickne$$e, but of
unequal length, are
to one another in
duplicate proporti-
on to that of their
Lengths; that is,
are as the Squares of
their Lengths.</P>
<P>We will $hew, in
the $econd place,
according to what proportion the Re$i$tance of Fraction in Pri$mes
and Cylinders encrea$eth, when they continue of the $ame length,
and encrea$e in thickne$s. And here I $ay, that</P>
<head>PROPOSITION IV.</head>
<P><I>In Pri$mes and Cylinders of equal length, but unequal
thickne$s, the Re$i$tance again$t Fraction encrea$eth
in a proportion iriple to the Diameters of their
Thickne$$es, that is, of their Ba$es.</I></P>
<P>Let the two Cylinders be the$e A and <I>B, [as in</I> Fig. 5.]
who$e equal lengths are D G, and F H, the unequal <I>B</I>a$es
the Circles, who$e Diameters are C D, and E F. I $ay,
that the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder <I>B</I> is to the Re$i$tance of the
Cylinder A again$t Fraction, in a proportion triple to that which
the Diameter F E hath to the Diameter D C. For if we con$ider
the ab$olute and $imple Re$i$tance that re$ides in the <I>B</I>a$es, that
is, in the Circles E F, and D C to breaking, offering them vio-
lence by pulling them end-waies, without all doubt, the Re$i$tance
of the Cylinder <I>B,</I> is $o much greater than that of the Cylinder A,
by how much the Circle E F is greater than C D; for the Fibres,
Filaments, or tenacious parts, which hold together the Parts of the
Solid, are $o many the more. <I>B</I>ut if we con$ider, that in offering
<foot>O them</foot>
<p n=>98</p>
them violence tran$ver$ly we make u$e of two Leavers; of which
the Parts or Di$tances, at which the Forces are applied are the Lines
D G, and F H, the Fulciments are in the Points D and F; but the
other Parts or Di$tances, at which the Re$i$tances are placed, are
the Semidiameters of the Circles D C and E F, becau$e the Fila-
ments di$per$ed thorow the whole Superficies of the Circles are as
if they were all reduced into the Centers: con$idering, I $ay, tho$e
Leavers, we would be under$tood to intend, that the Re$i$tance in
the Center of the Ba$e E F again$t the Force of H, is $o much grea-
ter than the Re$i$tance of the Ba$e C D, again$t the Force placed
in G, (and the Forces in G and H are of equal Leavers D G, and
F H) as the Semidiameter F E is greater than the Semidiameter
D C, the Re$i$tance again$t Fraction, therefore, in the Cylinder
B, encrea$eth above the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder A, according
to both the proportions of the Circles E F and D C, and of their
Semidiameters, or, if you will, Diameters: <I>B</I>ut the proportion of
the Circles is double of that of the Diameters; Therefore the pro-
portion of the Re$i$tances, which is compounded of them, is in
triplicate proportion of the $aid Diameters: Which is that which
I was to prove. <I>B</I>ut becau$e al$o the Cubes are in triplicate pro-
portion to their Sides, we may likewi$e conclude, <I>That the Re$i-
$tances of Cylinders of equal Length, are to one another as the Cubes
of their Diameters.</I></P>
<P>From that which we have Demon$trated we may likewi$e con-
clude, that</P>
<head>COROLARY.</head>
<P><I>The Re$i$tances of Pri$ms, and Cylinders of equal length are in
Se$quialter proportion to that of the $aid Cylinders.</I></P>
<P>The which is manife$t, becau$e the Pri$ms and Cylinders,
equal in height, are to one another, in the $ame proportion as
their <I>B</I>a$es; that is, the double of the Sides or Diameters of the
$aid <I>B</I>a$es: <I>B</I>ut the Re$i$tances (as hath been demon$trated) are
in triplicate proportion to the $aid Sides or Diameters: Therefore
the proportion of the Re$i$tances is Se$quialter to the proportion
of the $aid Solids, and, con$equently, to the Weights of the $aid
Solids.</P>
<P>SIMP. It is convenient, that, before we proceed any farther, I
be re$olved of a certain Doubt, and this it is, That I have not hi-
therto heard propo$ed to Con$ideration another certain kind of
Re$i$tance, that, in my opinion, is $ucce$$ively dimini$hed in So-
lids, according as they are more and more prolonged, and not on-
ly in u$ing them $idelongs, but al$o leng thwaies, in the $elf $ame
<foot>manner</foot>
<p n=>99</p>
manner ju$t as we $ee a very long Cord to be much le$$e apt to
$u$tain a great weight, than if it were $hort: $o that I believe, that
a Ruler of Wood or Iron will $u$tain a much greater weight, if it
$hall be $hort, than if it $hall be very long; under$tanding it al-
waies to be u$ed lengthwaies, and not tran$ver$ly; and al$o
its own weight being accounted for, which in the longer is
greater.</P>
<P>SALV. I fear, <I>Simplicius,</I> that in this Point you, with many
others, are deceived, if $o be, that I have rightly apprehended your
meaning, $o that you would $ay, that a Cord <I>v. gr.</I> forty yards
long cannot $u$tain $o much, as if u$e were made but of one or two
yards of the $ame Rope.</P>
<P>SIMP. That is it, which I would have $aid, and as yet it $eemeth
a very probable Propo$ition.</P>
<P>SALV. But I hold it not only improbable, but fal$e: and think
that I can very ea$ily reclaim you from your Errour. Therefore
let us $uppo$e this Rope A B, [<I>as in</I> Fig. 6.] fa$tned on high by
the end A, and by the other end let there hang the Weight C,
by the force of which, the $aid Rope is to be broken. Do you
a$$ign me the particular place, <I>Simplicius,</I> where the Rupture is
to happen.</P>
<P>SIMP. Let it be in the place D.</P>
<P>SALV. I ask what is the cau$e why it $hould break in D.</P>
<P>SIMP. The rea$on thereof is, becau$e the Rope was not $trong
enough in that part, to $u$tain <I>v. gr.</I> an hundred pounds of weight,
for $o much is the Rope D B with the Stone C.</P>
<P>SALV. Therefore when ever $uch a Rope $hall come to be vio-

at the end of the Rope <I>B,</I> but near to the point D, as for in$tance,
in E, or el$e did tye the Rope not at the height A, but very near,
and almo$t at the Point D it $elf, as in F, tell me, I $ay, whether
the Point D would feel the $ame weight of an hundred pounds.</P>

<P>SALV. If then the Rope in the Point D commeth to be drawn
by the $aid hundred pounds of weight, it will break by your con-
ce$$ion. And yet F E, is a $mall piece of the length A <I>B</I>: why do
you $ay then, that the long Rope is weaker than the $hort one?
<I>B</I>e content, therefore, to $uffer your $elf to be reclaimed from an
Errour, in which you have had many Companions, and tho$e in

their Re$i$tances, according to the Squares of their Lengths (alwaies

the$e that are equally long, but different in thickne$$e, encrea$e
their Re$i$tances according to the proportion of the Cubes of the

their lengths reciprocally taken.</I></P>
<P>Let the$e two A B C, and D E F, [<I>as in</I> Fig. 7.] be $uch Cy-

the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder D F, in a proportion com-
pounded of the proportion of the Cube of the Diameter A B, to
the Gube of the Diameter D E, and of the proportion of the
Length E F to the Length B C. Suppo$e E G equal to B C, and to
the Lines A B, and D E, let C H be a third proportional, and I,
a fourth; and as E F is to B C, $o let I be to S. And becau$e the
Re$i$tance of the Cylinder A C is to the Re$i$tance of the Cylin-
der D G, as the Cube A B to the Cube D E; that is, as the Line
A B to the Line I: and the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder G D is to
the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder D F, as the Length F E is to the
Length E G; that is, as the Line I is to S: Therefore by Equali-
ty of proportion, as the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder A C is to the
Re$i$tance of the Cylinder D F, $o is the Line A B to S: But the
Line A B is to S, in a proportion compounded of A B to I, and of
I to S: Therefore the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder A C is to the Re-
$i$tance of the Cylinder D F, in a proportion compounded of A B
to I, that is, as the Cube of A B to the Cube of D E, and of the
proportion of the Line I to S; that is, of the Length E F to the

<P>For demon$tration of which let us de$cribe the two like Cy-

And becau$e the Moments of the Solids A B, and C D, to over-
come the Re$i$tances of their Ba$es B and D, are compounded of
their Gravities, and of the Forces of their Leavers, and the Force
of the Leaver A B is equal to the Force of the Leaver C D, and
that becau$e the length A B hath the $ame proportion to the Semi-
diameter of the Ba$e B, (by the $imilitude of the Cylinders) that

total Moment of C D, as the $ole Gravity of the Cylinder A B is
to the $ole Gravity of the Cylinder C D; that is, as the $aid Cy-
linder A B is to the $aid C D: But the$e are in triplicate propor-
tion to the Diameters of their Ba$es <I>B</I> and D; and the Re$i$tances
of the $ame <I>B</I>a$es, being to one another as the $aid <I>B</I>a$es, they are
con$equently in duplicate proportion to their $ame <I>B</I>a$es: There-

the Re$i$tances of their <I>B</I>a$es.</P>
<P>SIMP. This Propo$ition, indeed, is not only new, but unexpe-
cted to me, and at fir$t $ight, very remote from the judgment that
I $hould have conjecturally pa$t upon it: for in regard, that the$e
Figures are in all other re$pects alike, I $hould have thought that
their Moments likewi$e $hould have retained the $ame proportion
towards their proper Re$i$tances.</P>
<P>SAGR. This is the Demon$tration of that Propo$ition, that in

time to my $elf, believing, that the Re$i$tances of like Solids were
alike, till that a certain, and that no very fixed or accurate Ob$er-
vation $eemed to repre$ent unto me, that Solids do not contain
an equal tenure in their Toughne$s, but that the bigger are le$$e
apt to $uffer violent accidents, as lu$ty men are more damnified by
their falls than little children; and, as in the begining we $aid, we
$ee a great <I>B</I>eam or Column break to pieces falling from the $ame
height, and not a $mall Pri$in or little Cylinder of Marble. This
$ame Ob$ervation gave me the hint for finding of that which I am
now about to demon$trate; a Quality truly admirable, for that
among$t the infinite Solid-like Figures, there are not $o much
as two, who$e Moments retain the $ame proportion towards their
proper Re$i$tances.</P>
<P>SIMP. Now you put me in mind of $omething in$erted by <I>Ari-
$totle</I> among$t his Mechanical Que$tions, where he would give a
Rea$on, whence it is, that <I>B</I>eams the longer they are, they are by $o
much the more weak, and bend more and more, although the $hort
ones be the $lendere$t, and the long ones thicke$t: and, if I well re-
member, he reduceth the Rea$on to the $imple Leaver.</P>

al$o remaining perplexed in this point, whether, the lengths and

<P><I>Of like and heavy Pri$ms or Cylinders there is one only,
and no more, that is reduced (being charged with its
own weight) to the ultimate $tate between breaking
and holding it $elf together: $othat every greater, as
being unable to re$i$t its own weight, will break,
and every le$$er re$i$teth $ome Force that is employed
again$t it to break, it.</I></P>
<P>Let the heavy Pri$m be A B [<I>as in</I> Fig 9.] reduced to the
utmo$t length of its Con$i$tance, $o that being lengthned
never $o little more it will break: I $ay, that this is the only
one among$t all tho$e that are like unto it, (which yet are infinite)
that is capable of being reduced to that dubious and tickli$h $tate;
$o that every greater being oppre$$ed with its own weight will
break, and every le$$er not, nay, will be able to re$i$t $ome additi-
on of a new violence, over and above that of its own weight.
Fir$t, take the Pri$m C E, like to, and greater than A B. I $ay, that
this cannot con$i$t, but will break, being overcome by its own
Gravity. Suppo$e the part C D as long as A B. And becau$e the

C D to the Cube of the thickne$s of A B; that is, as the Pri$m
C E to the Pri$m A B (being alike:) Therefore the Weight of
C E is the greate$t that can be $u$tained at the length of the Pri$m
C D: But the Length C E is greater: Therefore the Pri$m C E
will break. But let F G be le$$et: it $hall be demon$trated like-
wi$e ($uppo$ing F H equal to B A) that the Re$i$tance of F G is
to that of A B, as the Pri$m F G is to the Pri$m A B, in ca$e that the
Di$tance A B, that is F H, were equal to F G, but it is greater:
Therefore the Moment of the Pri$m F G, placed in G, doth not
$uffice to break the Pri$m F G.</P>

the proportion betwixt the Length and Thickne$$e of the greater
Pri$m by making it thicker or $horter, to the end it might be re-

<P>Let the Cylinder B C [<I>as in</I> Fig. 10.] be the bigge$t that
can re$i$t its own weight, and let D E be a Length greater
than A C; it is required to find the Thickne$$e of the Cylin-
der, that under the Length D E is the greate$t re$i$ting its own
weight. Let I be a third proportional to the Lengths D E, and
A C; and as D E is to I, $o let the Diameter F D be to the Dia-
meter B A: and make the Cylinder F E. I $ay, that this is the big-
ge$t, and only one among$t all that are like to it that re$i$teth its
own weight. To the Lines D C and I let M be a third propor-
tional, and O a fourth. And $uppo$e F G equal to A C. And be-
cau$e the Diameter F D is to the Diameter A B, as the Line D E
to I, and O is a fourth proportional to D E and I, the Cube of
F D $hall be to the Cube of B A as D E is to O: But as the Cube of
F D is to the Cube of B A, $o is the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder
D G to the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder B C: Therefore the Re$i-
$tance of the Cylinder D G is to that of the Cylinder B C, as the
Line D F is to O. And becau$e the Moment of the Cylinder B C
is equal to its Re$i$tance, if we $hew that the Moment of the Cylin-
der F E is to the Moment of the Cylinder B C, as the Re$i$tance
D F to the Re$i$tance B A; that is, as the Cube of F D to the Cube
of B A; that is, as the Line D E to O, we $hall have our intent:
that is, that the Moment of the Cylinder F E is equal to the Re$i-
$tance placed in F D. The Moment of the Cylinder F E is to the
Moment of the Cylinder D G, as the Square of D E is to the
Square of A C; that is, as the Line D E to I: But the Moment of
the Cylinder D G is to the Moment of the Cylinder B C, as the
Square D F to the Square B A; that is, as the Square of D E to the
Square of I; that is, as the Square of I to the Square of M; that
is, as I to O: Therefore, by Equality of proportion, as the Mo-

$o is the Line D E to O; that is, the Cube D F to the Cube
B A; that is, the Re$i$tance of the Ba$e D F to the Re$i$tance

<marg><I>The la$t Problem
performed another
way.</I></marg>
[<I>as in</I> Fig. 11.] the Diameter of who$e Ba$e let be the Line D C,
and let this A be the greate$t that can $u$tain it $elf and not break,
than which we will find a bigger, which likewi$e $hall be the big-
ge$t al$o, and the only one that $u$taineth it $elf. Let us de$ire one
like to the $aid A, and as long as the a$$igned Line, and let this be
<I>v. gr.</I> E, the Diameter of who$e Ba$e let be K L; and to the two
Lines D C, and K L let M N be a third proportional; which let be
the Diameter of the Ba$e of the Cylinder X, in length equal to E.
I $ay, that this X is that which we $eek. And becau$e the Re$i-
$tance D C is to the Re$i$tance K L, as the Square D C to the
<I>S</I>quare K L; that is, as the Square K L to the Square M N; that
is, as the Cylinder E to the Cylinder X; that is, as the Moment E
to the Moment X: But the Re$i$tance K L is to M N, as the Cube
of K L is to the Cube of M N; that is, as the Cube B C to the
Cube K L; that is, as the Cylinder A to the Cylinder E; that is,
as the Moment A to the Moment E: Therefore, by Perturbation
of proportion, as the Re$i$tance D C is to M N, $o is the Moment
A to the Moment X: Therefore the Pri$m X, is in the $ame Con$ti-

<P>Rea$$uming the above $aid Figure and almo$t the $ame Me-

F E hath the $ame proportion to the Moment of the part
D G, that the Square E D hath to the Square F G; that is that
the Line D E hath to I: and becau$e the Moment of the Cylinder
F G is to the Moment of the Cylinder A C, as the Square F D to
the Square A B; that is, as the Square D E to the Square I; that
is, as the Square I to the Square M; that is, as the Line I to O:
Therefore, <I>ex &aelig;quali,</I> the Moment of the Cylinder F E hath the
$ame proportion to the Moment of the Cylinder A C, that the
Line D E hath to the Line O; that is, that the Cube D E hath
to the Cube of I; that is, that the Cube of F D hath to the
Cube of A B; that is, that the Re$i$tance of the Ba$e F D hath to
the Re$i$tance of the Ba$e A B: Which was to be performed.</P>

Refi$ting than that which $he commonly u$eth, or el$e $hould de-
form tho$e Bones by augmenting them beyond their due Symetry,
and making the Figure or $hape of the Animal to become mon-
$trou$ly big: Which haply was hinted by my mo$t Witty Poet,
where de$cribing an huge Giant, he $aith,</P>

<marg><I>Example of the
Bone of an Animal
enlarged to thrice
the Natural pro-

thicker it ought to
be to perform its

<P>And for a $hort example of this that I $ay, [<I>as in</I> Fig. 12.] I
have heretofore drawn the Figure of a Bone only trebled in
Length, and augmented in Thickne$$e in $uch proportion, as that
it may in its great Animal perform the office proportionate to that
of the le$$er Bone in a $maller Animal, and the Figures are the$e:
whereby you $ee what a di$proportionate Figure that of the aug-
mented Bone becometh. Whence it is manife$t, that he that would
in an huge Giant keep the proportions that the Members have in
<foot>an</foot>
<p n=>107</p>
an ordinary Man, mu$t either find Matter much more hard and re-
$i$ting to make Bone of, or el$e mu$t admit that its Strength is in
proportion much more weak than in Men of middle Stature: other-
wi$e, encrea$ing the Giant to an immea$urable height he would be
oppre$$ed, and fall under his own weight. Whereas on the con-
trary, in dimini$hing of Bodies we do not $ee the Strength and
Forces to dimini$h in the $ame proportion, nay, in the le$$er the
Robu$tiou$ne$$e encrea$eth with a great proportion. So that I
believe, that a little Dog could carry on his back two or three Dogs
equal to him$elf, but I do not think that an Hor$e could carry $o
much as one $ingle Hor$e of his own $ize.</P>
<P>SIMP. But if it be $o, I have great rea$on to doubt the Im-
men$e bulks that we $ee in Fi$hes, for (if I rightly under$tand
you) a Whale $hall be as big as ten Elephants, and yet they $u-
$tain them$elves.</P>
<P>SALV. Your doubt, <I>Simplicius,</I> prompts me with another Con-
dition which I perceived not before, which is al$o able to make
Giants and other very big Animals to con$i$t, and act them$elves
no le$$e than $maller, and this will happen when not only Strength
is added to the Bones and other Parts, who$e office it is to $u$tain
their own and the $upervenient weight; but the $tructure of the
Bones being left with the $ame proportions, the $ame Fabricks
would ju$t in the $ame manner, yea, with much more ea$e, con-
$i$t, when the Gravity of the matter of tho$e Bones, or that of
the Fle$h, or whatever el$e is to re$t it $elf upon the Bones is dimini-
$hed in that proportion: and of this $econd Artifice, Nature hath
made u$e in the framing of Fi$hes, making their Bones, and Pulps,
not only very light, but without any Gravity.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $ee very well, <I>Salviatus,</I> whither your Di$cour$e ten-
deth: you will $ay, that becau$e the Element of Water is the Ha-
bitation of Fi$hes, which by its Corpulence, or, as others will, by
its Gravity dimini$heth the weight of Bodies demerged in it, for
that rea$on the Matter of Fi$hes, not weighing any thing, may be
$u$tained without $urcharging their Bones: but this doth not $uf-
fice, for although the re$t of the $ub$tance of the Fi$h weigh not,
yet without doubt the matter of their Bones hath its weight:
and who will $ay, that the Rib of a Whale that is as big as a
Beam doth not weigh very much, and in Water $inketh to the Bot-
tom? The$e therefore $hould not be able to $ub$i$t in $o va$t a
Bulk.</P>
<P>SALV. You argue very cunningly; and for an an$wer to your
Doubt, tell me, whether you have ob$erved Fi$hes to $tand im-
moveable under water at their plea$ures, and not to de$cend to-
wards the Bottom, or rai$e them$elves towards the top without
making $ome motion with their Fins?</P>
<foot>P 2 SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>108</p>
<P>SIMP. This is a very manife$t Ob$ervation.</P>
<marg><I>The Cau$e why
Fi$hes do equili-
brate them$elves
in the Water.</I></marg>
<P>SALV. This power therefore that the Fi$hes have to $tay them-
$elves, as if they were immoveable in the mid$t of the Water, is a
mo$t infallible argument, that the Compofition of their Corporeal
Ma$$e equalleth the Specifick Gravity of the Water, $o that if
there be found in them $ome parts that are more grave than the
Water, it is nece$$arily requi$ite that they have others $o much
le$$e grave, $o that the <I>Equilibrium</I> may be ballanced. If therefore
the Bones be more grave, it is nece$$ary that the Pulps, or other
Matters that are in them, be more light; and the$e will with their
lightne$$e counterpoi$e and compen$ate the weight of the Bones.
So that in Aquatick Animals the quite contrary hapneth to that
which befals the Terre$trial, namely, that in the latter it is the of-
fice of the Bones to $u$tain their own weight, and the weight of
the Fle$h; and in the former, the <I>Fle$h [if one may $o call it]</I>
<marg><I>Aquatick Animals
greater than the
Terre$trial, and for
what Rea$on.</I></marg>
beareth up its own weight, and that of the Bones. And therefore
cea$e to wonder how there may be mo$t va$t Animals in the Wa-
ter, but not on the Earth, that is, in the Air.</P>
<P>SIMP. I am $atisfied, and moreover ob$erve, that the$e which
we call Terre$trial Animals, ought with more rea$on to be called
Aerial; becau$e in the Air they really live, and by the Air they are
environ'd, and of the Air they breath.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Di$cour$e of <I>Simplicius</I> plea$eth me, as al$o his
Doubt and its Solution. And farthermore I comprehend very ea-
$ily, that one of the$e huge Fi$hes being haul'd on $hore, could not
perchance be able to $u$tain it $elf for any time; but that the Con-
nections of the Bones being relaxed, its Ma$$e would be cru$h'd un-
der its own weight.</P>
<P>SALV. For the pre$ent, I encline to the $ame Opinion: nor am
I far from thinking that the $ame would happen to that huge Ship,
which floating in the Sea is not di$$olved by its weight, and the bur-
den of its Lading and Artilery, but on dry ground, and environed
with Air, it perhaps would fall in pieces. But let us pur$ue our bu-

weight, and likewi$e let the Weight D be given, the great-
e$t that can be $u$tained by the extreme C: it is required to
finde the greate$t Length unto which the $aid Pri$me may be pro-
longed, without breaking. As the weight of the Pri$me A C is to
the Compound of the weights A C, with the double of the
Weight D, $o let the length C A be to C A H: between which
let A G be a Mean-Proportional. I $ay that A G is the Length
$ought. For the depre$$ing Moment of the Weight D in C, is
equal to the Moment of the double weight D, if it be placed in
the middle of A C, where is al$o the Center of the Moment of
the Pri$me A C: The Moment, therefore, of the Re$i$tance of
the Pri$me A C, which re$ides in A, is equivalent to the gravi-
tation of the double of the Weight D with the weight A C, but
hanged in the mid$t of A C. And becau$e it hath been made,
that as the Moment of the $aid Weights $o $ituated, that is, of
the double of D, with A C, is to the Moment of A C, $o is H A
to A C, between which A G is a Mean Proportional: There-
fore the Moment of D doubled with the Moment of A C, is to
the Moment A C, as the Square G A to the Square A C: But the
pre$$ing Moment of the Pri$me G A, is to the Moment of A C,
as the Square G A to the Square A C: Therefore the Length
A G is the greate$t that was $ought, namely, that unto which the
Pri$me A G being prolonged, it would $u$tain it $elf, but beyond
it would break.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have con$idered the Moments and Re$i$tances of
$olid Pri$mes and Cylinders, one end of which is $uppo$ed im-
moveable, and to the other onely the Force of a pre$$ing weight
is applyed, con$idering it by it $elf alone, or joyned with the
Gravity of the $ame Solid, or el$e the $ole Gravity of the $aid
Solid. Now I de$ire that we may $peak $omething of tho$e $ame
Pri$mes or Cylinders, in ca$e they were $u$tained at both ends, or
did re$t upon one $ole point taken between the ends. And fir$t,
I $ay that,</P>

$hall be reduced to its greate$t Length, beyond which
it would not $u$tain it $elf, whether it be born up in

the ends, may be double in length to that which
$hould be fa$tned in the Wall, that is $u$tained at but
one end.</I></P>
<P>Which of it $elt is very obvious; for if we $hall $up-
po$e of the Cylinder which I de$cribe A B C, its

$u$tained, being fa$tened at the end B, it $hall be $u$tained in the
$ame manner, if being laid upon the Fulciment G, it $hall be
counterpoi$ed by its other half B C. And likewi$e, if of the Cy-
linder D E F, the Length $hall be $uch that onely one half of it
can be $u$tained, being fa$tened at the end D, and con$equent-
ly the other E F, fixed at the end F; it is manife$t, that placing
the Fulciments H and I under the ends D and F, every Moment
of Force or of Weight that is added in E, will there make the

<P><I>To find whether that Force or weight, that being ap-
plied to the middle of a Cylinder $u$tained at the

<P>As for Example, whether we de$iring to break a Staffe
and took it with the ends in our hands, and $etting our

fice to break it in that manner, would al$o $uffice in ca$e the knee
<foot>were</foot>
<p n=>111</p>
were $et, not in the mid$t, but neerer to one of the ends.</P>
<P>SAGR. I think the Problem is toucht upon by <I>Ari$totle</I> in his
<I>Mechanical Que$tions.</I></P>
<P>SALV. The Que$tion of <I>Aristotle</I> is not preci$ely the $ame,
for he $eeks no more, but to render a rea$on why le$$e labour is
required to break the Staffe, holding the hands at the ends of it,
that is, far di$tant from the Knee, than if we held them neerer:
and he giveth a general Rea$on of the $ame, reducing the cau$e
of it to the Leavers, which are longer when the Arms are ex-
tended, gra$ping the ends. Our Que$tion addeth $omething
more, $eeking whether, $etting the Knee in the mid$t, or in ano-
ther place, but alwayes keeping the hands at the ends, the $ame
Force $erveth in all $ituations.</P>
<P>SAGR. At fir$t apprehen$ion it $hould $eem that it doth, for
that the two Leavers retain in a certain fa$hion the $ame Moment,
$eeing that as the one is $hortned, the other is lengthened.</P>
<P>SALV. Now you $ee, how ea$ie it is to make Equivocations,
and with what caution and circum$pection we are to walk, lea$t
we run into them. This that you $ay, and which indeed at the
fir$t $ight carrieth with it $o much of probability, is in the $trict-
ne$$e of it $o fal$e, that whether the Knee, which is the Fulci-
ment of the two Leavers, be placed or not placed in the mid$t,
it maketh $uch alteration, that of that Force which would $uffice
to make the Fracture in the mid$t, it being to be made in $ome
other place, it will not $uffice to apply four times $o much, nor
ten, nor an hundred, no nor a thou$and. Upon this we will
make $ome general Con$ideration, and then we will come to the
Specifick Determination of the Propo$ition, according to which,
the Forces for making of Fractures gradually vary more in one
point than in another.</P>
<P>Let us fir$t de$igne this Truncheon A B to be broken in the
mid$t upon the Fulciment C, and neer unto that let us de$igne
it again, but under the Characters D E, to be broken on the
Fulciment F, remote from the middle. Fir$t it is manife$t, that
the Di$tances A C and C B being equal, the Force $hall be $ha-
red equally in the ends B and A. Again, according as the Di-
$tance D F groweth le$$e than the Di$tance A C, the Moment
of the Force placed in D groweth le$$e than the Moment in A,
that is placed at the Di$tance C A, and le$$eneth according to
the proportion of the Line D F to A C; and con$equently, it is
requi$ite to encrea$e it to equalize or exceed the Re$i$tance of F:
But the Di$tance D F may dimini$h <I>in infinitum,</I> in relation to
the Di$tance A C: Therefore it is requi$ite, that it be po$$ible for
the Force to be applyed in D, to encrea$e <I>in infinitum,</I> that it
may countervail the Re$i$tance in F. But, on the contrary, ac-
<foot>cording</foot>
<p n=>112</p>
cording as the Di$tance F E encrea$eth above C B, it is requi$ite
to dimini$h the Force in E, that it may compen$ate the Re$i-
$tance in F: But the Di$tance F E in relation to C B, cannot en-
crea$e <I>in infinitum,</I> by drawing the Fulciment F towards the end
D, no nor yet to the double: Therefore, the Force in E, that it
may compen$ate the Re$i$tance in F, $hall be alwayes more than
half of the Force in B. We may comprehend, therefore, the ne-
ce$$ity of augmenting the Moments of the Collected Forces in E
and D infinitely to equalize or exceed the Re$i$tance placed in F,
according as the Fulciment F $hall approach neerer and neerer
to the end D.</P>

fe$$e the Virtue of Geometry to be a more powerful in$trument
than all others, to $harpen the Wit, and di$po$e it to di$cour$e

his Scholars $hould be well grounded in the Mathematicks? I
have very well under$tood the nature of the Leaver, and how
that its Length encrea$ing or decrea$ing, the Moment of the
Force and of the Re$i$tance augmented or dimini$hed, and yet in
the determination of the pre$ent Problem I deceived my $elf, and
that not a little, but infinitely much.</P>
<P>SIMP. The truth is, I begin to $ee that Logick, although it
be a mo$t appo$ite In$trument to regulate our Di$cour$e, doth
not attain, as to the prompting of the Mind with Invention,
unto the acutene$$e of Geometry.</P>
<P>SAGR. In my conceit, Logick giveth us to under$tand, whe-
ther the Di$courfes and Demon$trations already made and found
are concluding, but that it teacheth us how to finde concluding
Di$cour$es and Demon$trations; the truth is, I do not believe:
But it will be better, that <I>Salviatus</I> $hew us according to what pro-

<P>Let the two Forces (<I>as in</I> Fig. 16.) be A and B the lea$t, to

I $ay the Forces A and B have the $ame proportion to the
Forces E and F, that the Rectangle A D B hath to the Rectan-
gle A C B. For the Forces A and B, have to the Forces E and F, a
proportion compounded of the Forces A and B, to the Force
B, of B to F, and of F to E and E: But as the Forces A and
B are to the Force B, $o is the Length B A to A C; and as the
Force B is to F, $o is the Line D B to B C; and as the Force F is
to F and E, $o is the Line D A to A B: Therefore the Forces A
and B have to the Forces E and F a proportion compounded of
the$e three, namely, of B A to A C, of D B to B C, and of D A
A B. But of the two proportions D A to A B, and A B to A C,
is compounded the proportion of D A to A C: Therefore the
Forces A and B have to the Forces E and F, the proportion com-
pounded of this D A to A C, and of the other D B to D C.
But the Rectangle A D B hath to the Rectangle A C B, a pro-
portion compounded of the $ame D A to A C, and of D B to
B C: Therefore the Forces A and B are to the Forces E and F,
as the Rectangle A D B is to the Rectangle A C B; which is as
much as to $ay, the Re$i$tance again$t Fraction in C, hath the
$ame proportion to the Re$i$tance again$t Fraction in D, that
the Rectangle A D B hath to the Rectangle A C B: Which was
to be demon$trated.</P>

<P>Let the given weight greater than the greate$t weight that

unto the $aid greate$t weight, the proportion of the line E

$o let A D be to S, S $hall be le$$er than A D. Let A D be the
Diameter of the Semicircle A H D: in which $uppo$e A H equal

I $ay that R is the point $ought, at which the given weight,
greater than the greate$t that can be $upported at the middle of the

that is, to the Square A D;
that is, to the two A H and

$hall be equal to the Square A H; that is, to the Square S: But
the Square S is to the Square A D, as F to E; that is, as the
greate$t $upportable Weight at D to the given greater Weight:
Therefore this greater $hall be $upported at R, as the greate$t
that can be there $u$tained. Which is that that we $ought.</P>
<P>SAGR. I under$tand you very well, and am con$idering that

gain$t Pre$$ion in the parts that more and more recede from the
middle, whether in very great and heavy Beams one may take
<foot>away</foot>
<p n=>115</p>
away a pretty big part towards the end with a notable alleviation
of the weight; which in Beams of great Rooms would be commo-
dious, and of no $mall pro$it. And it would be pretty, to find what
Figure that Solid ought to have, that it might have equal Re$i-
$tance in all its parts; $o as that it were not with more ea$e to be
broken by a weight that $hould pre$$e it in the mid$t, than in any
other place.</P>
<P>SALV. I was ju$t about to tell you a thing very notable and
plea$ant to this purpo$e. I will a$$ume a brief Scheme for the bet-
ter explanation of my meaning. This Figure D B is a Pri$m, who$e
Re$i$tance again$t Fraction in the term A D by a Force pre$$ing
at the term B, is le$$e than the Re$i$tance that would be found in
the place C I, by how much the length C B is le$$er than B A; as
hath already been demon-
$trated. Now $uppo$e the
<fig>
$aid Pri$me to be $awed
Diagonally according to the
Line FB, $o that the oppo-
$ite Surfaces may be two
Triangles, one of which to-
wards us is F A B. This So-
lid obtains a quality contrary to the Pri$me, to wit, that it le$$e re-
$i$teth Fraction by the Force placed in B at the term C than at A,
by as much the Length C <I>B</I> is le$$e than <I>B</I> A; Which we will ea
$ily prove: For imagining the Section C N O parallel to the other
A F D, the Line <I>F</I> A $hall be to C N in the Triangle F A <I>B</I> in the
$ame proportion, as the Line A <I>B</I> is to <I>B</I> C: and therefore if we
$uppo$e the Fulciment of the two Leavers to be in the Points A
and C, who$e Di$tances are <I>B</I> A, A F, <I>B</I> C, and C N, the$e, I $ay,
$hall be like: and therefore that Moment which the <I>F</I>orce placed
at <I>B</I> hath at the Di$tance <I>B</I> A above the Re$i$tance placed at the
Di$tance A <I>F</I>, the $aid <I>F</I>orce at <I>B</I> $hall have at the Di$tance <I>B</I>C
above the $ame Re$i$tance, were it placed at the Di$tance C N:
<I>B</I>ut the Re$i$tance to be overcome at the <I>F</I>ulciment C, being pla-
ced at the Di$tance C N, from the <I>F</I>orce in <I>B</I> is le$$er than the
Re$i$tance in A $o much as the Rectangle C O is le$$e than the
Rectangle A D; that is, $o much as the Line C N is le$s than A <I>F</I>;
that is, C <I>B</I> than B A: Therefore the Re$i$tance of the part O C B
again$t <I>F</I>raction in C is $o much le$s than the Re$i$tance of the
whole D A O again$t <I>F</I>racture in O, as the Length C B is le$s than
A B. We have therefore from the Beam or Pri$me D B, taken
away a part, that is half, cutting it Diagonally, and left the Wedge
or triangular Pri$m <I>F</I> B A; and they are two Solids of contrary
Qualities, namely, that more re$i$ts the more it is $hortned, and this
in $hortning lo$eth its toughne$s as fa$t. Now this being granted,
<foot>Q 2 it</foot>
<p n=>116</p>
it $eemeth very rea$onable, nay, nece$$ary, that one may give it
a cut, by which taking away that which is $uperfluous, there remai-
neth a Solid of $uch a <I>F</I>igure, as in all its parts hath equal Re$i-
$tance.</P>

the greater to the le$$er, one meeteth al$o with the equal.</P>

Saw for making of this Section.</P>
<P>SIMP. This $eemeth to me as if it were a very ea$ie bu$ine$$e;
for if in $awing the Pri$m diagonally, taking away half of it, the
Figure that remains retaineth a contrary quality to that of the
whole Pri$m, $o as that in all places wherein this acquireth $trength,
that as fa$t lo$eth it, me thinks, that keeping the middle way, that
is, taking only the half of that half, which is the fourth part of the
whole, the remaining Figure will not gain or lo$e $trength in any
of all tho$e places wherein the lo$$e and the gain of the other two
Figures were alwaies equal.</P>
<P>SALV. You have not hit the mark, <I>Simplicius</I>; and as I $hall
$hew you, it will appear in reality, that that which may be cut off
from the Pri$m, and taken away without weakening it is not its
fourth part, but the third. Now it remaineth (which is that that

<head>PROP. XIV. PROBL. V.</head>
<P><I>To find according to what Line the Section is to be

<P>But fir$t it is nece$$ary to demon$trate a certain Lemma, which
is this:</P>
<head>LEMMA I.</head>
<P><I>If there $hall be two Ballances or Leavers divided by their Fulci-
ments in $uch $ort that the two Distances where at the Forces
are to be placed, have to each other double the proportion of
the Di$tances at which the Re$i$tances $ball be, which Re$i-
$tances are to each other as their Di$tances, the $u$taining
Powers $hall be equal.</I></P>
<P>Let A B and C D be two Leavers divided upon their Fulciments
E and F, in $uch $ort that the Di$tance E B hath to F D a pro-
portion double to that which the Di$tance E A hath to F C. I $ay,
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>117</p>
the Powers that in BD $hall $u$tain the Re$i$tances A and C $hall
be equal to each other. Let E G be $uppo$ed a Mean-Proporti-
onal between E B and F D; therefore as B E is to E G, $o $hall
G E be to F D, and A E to C <I>F</I>; and $o is $uppo$ed the Re$i$tance
of A to the Re$i$tance of C. And becau$e that as E G is to <I>F</I> D,
$o is A E to C <I>F</I>; by Permutation as G E is to E A, $o $hall D <I>F</I>
be to <I>F</I> C: And therefore (in
regard that the two Leavers
<fig>
D C and G A are divided pro-
portionally in the Points <I>F</I> and
E) in ca$e the Power that being
placed at D compen$ates the
Re$i$tance of C were at G, it
would countervail the $ame Re$i$tance of C placed in A: But by
what hath been granted, the Re$i$tance of A hath the $ame propor-
tion to the Re$i$tance of C, that AE hath to C <I>F</I>; that is, B E
hath to E G: Therefore the Power G, or if you will D, placed at
B will $u$tain the Re$i$tance placed at A: Which was to be de-
mon$trated.</P>
<P>This being under$tood: in the Surface <I>F</I> B of the Pri$me D B,
let the Parabolical Line <I>F</I> N B be drawn, who$e Vertex is B, ac-
cording to which let the $aid Pri$me be $uppo$ed to be $awed, the
Solid compri$ed between the Ba$e A D, the Rectangular Plane
A G, the Bight Line B G, and the Superficies D G B <I>F</I> being le$t
incurvated according to the Curvity of the Parabolical Line
<I>F</I> N B. I $ay, that
that Solid is through-
<fig>
out of equal Re$i-
$tance. Let it be cut
by the Plane C O pa-
rallel to A D; and
imagine two Leavers
divided and $uppor-
ted upon the Fulciments A and C; and let the Di$tances of one
be B A and A F, and of the other B C, and C N. And becau$e in
the Parabola <I>F B</I> A, A <I>B</I> is to <I>B</I> C, as the Square of <I>F</I> A to the
Square of C N, it is manife$t, that the Di$tance <I>B</I> A of one Leaver,
hath to the Di$tance <I>B</I> C of the other a proportion double to that
which the other Di$tance A <I>F</I> hath to the other C N, And be-
cau$e the Re$i$tance that is to be equal by help of the Leaver
<I>B</I> A hath the $ame proportion to the Re$i$tance that is to be
equal by help of the Leaver <I>B</I> C, that the Rectangle D A hath to
the Rectangle O C; which is the $ame that the Line A <I>F</I> hath to
N C, which are the other two Di$tances of the Leavers; it is ma-
nife$t by the fore going Lemma, that the $ame Force that being
<foot>applyed</foot>
<p n=>118</p>
applyed to the Line <I>B</I> G will equal the Re$i$tance D A, will like-
wi$e equal the Re$i$tance C O. And the $ame may be demon$tra-
ted, if one cut the Solid in any other place: therefore that Parabo-
lical Solid is throughout of equal Re$i$tance. In the next place,
that cutting the Pri$me according to the Parabolical Line F N B,
the third part of it is taken away, appeareth, For that the Semi-
Parabola F N <I>B</I> A and the Rectangle F <I>B</I> are Ba$es of two Solids
contained between two parallel Planes, that is, between the Rect-
angles F B and D G, whereby they retain the $ame Proportion, as
tho$e their Ba$es: But the Rectangle F <I>B</I> is Se$quialter to the Se-
miparabola F N <I>B</I> A: Therefore cutting the Pri$ine according to
the Parabolick Line, we take away the third part of it. Hence we
$ee, that <I>B</I>eams may be made with the diminution of their Weight
more than thirty three in the hundred, without dimini$hing their
Strength in the lea$t; which in great Ships, in particular, for bea-
ring the Decks may be of no $mall benefit; for that in $uch kind
of Fabricks Lightne$$e is of infinite importance.</P>
<P>SAGR. The Commodities are $o many, that it would be tedi-
ous, if not impo$$ible, to mention them all. <I>B</I>ut I, laying a$ide
the$e, would more gladly under$tand that the alleviation is made
according to the a$$igned proportions. That the Section, according
to the Diagonal Line, cuts away half of the weight I very well
know: but that the other Section according to the Parabolical Line
takes away the third part of the Pri$me I can believe upon the
word of <I>Salviatus,</I> who evermore $peaks the truth, but in this
Ca$e Science would better plea$e me than Faith.</P>
<P>SALV. I $ee then that you would have the Demon$tration,
whether or no it be true, that the exce$$e of the Pri$me over and
above this, which for this time we will call a Parabolical Solid, is
the third part of the whole Pri$me. I am certain that I have for-
merly demo$trated it; I will try now whether I can put the
Demon$tration together again: to which purpo$e I do remember
that I made u$e of a Certain Lemma of <I>Archimedes,</I> in$erted by

<head>LEMMA II.</head>
<P><I>If any number of Lines at plea$ure $hall exceed one another equal-

many more, each of them equal to the greate$t; the Squares of all

exceed one another: but they $hall be more than triple to tho$e
others that remain, the Square of the greate$t being $ub-
$tracted.</I></P>

Now let one of them be the Rectangle O <I>B,</I> and by the Points
where the other Parallels inter$ect the Parabolick Line, let the Pa-
rallels to A P pa$$e: and here I will $uppo$e a Figure to be cir-
cum$cribed about our Mixt-Triangle, compo$ed of Rectangles,
which are <I>B</I> O, I N, H M, F L, E K, G A; which Figure $hall al$o
yet be le$s than the third part of the Rectangle C P, in regard that
the exce$$e of that Figure over and above the Mixed Triangle is
much le$$e than the Rectangle <I>B</I> O, which yet again is le$$e than
the Space X.</P>
<P>SAGR. Softly, I pray you, for I do not $ee how the exce$$e of
this circum$cribed Figure above the Mixt Triangle is con$iderably
le$$er than the Rectangle <I>B</I> O.</P>
<P>SALV. Is not the Rectangle <I>B</I> O equal to all the$e $mall Rect-
angles by which our Parabolical Line pa$$eth; I mean the$e, <I>B</I> I,
I H, H F, F E, E G, and G A, of which one part only lyeth with-
out the Mixt Triangle? And the Rectangle <I>B</I> O, is it not al$o $up-
po$ed to be le$$e than the Space X? Therefore if the Triangle to-
gether with X did, as the Adver$ary $uppo$eth, equalize the third
part of the Rectangle C P the circum$cribed Figure that adjoyns
to the Triangle $o much le$$e than the Space X, will remain even
yet le$$e than the third part of the $aid Rectangle C P. <I>B</I>ut this
cannot be, for it is more than a third part, therefore it is not true
that our Mixt Triangle is le$$e than one third of the Rectangle.</P>
<P>SAGR. I under$tand the Solution of my Doubt. <I>B</I>ut it is
requi$ite now to prove unto us, that the Circum$cribed Figure is
more than a third part of the Rectangle C P; which, I believe, will
be harder to do.</P>
<P>SALV. Not at all. For in the Parabola the Square of the Line
<marg><I>The Quadrature of
the Parabola $hewn
by one $ingle De-
mon$tration.</I></marg>
D E hath the $ame proportion to the Square of Z G, that the Line
<foot>DA</foot>
<p n=>120</p>
D A hath to A Z; which is the $ame that the Rectangle K E hath to
the Rectangle A G, their heights A K and K L being equal. There-
fore the proportion that the Square E D hath to the Square Z G;
that is, the Square L A hath to the Square A K, the Rectangle K E
hath likewi$e to the Rectangle K Z. And in the $elf-$ame manner
we might prove that the other Rectangles L F, M H, N I, O B are
to one another as the Squares of the Lines M A, N A, O A, P A.
Con$ider we in the next place, how the Circum$cribed Figure is
compounded of certain Spaces that are to one another as the
Squares of the Lines that exceed with Exce$$es equal to the lea$t,
and how the Rectangle C P is compounded of $o many other Spa-
ces each of them equal to the Greate$t, which are all the Rectan-
gles equal to O B. Therefore, by the Lemma of <I>Archimedes,</I> the
Circum$cribed Figure is more than the third part of the Rectangle
C P: But it was al$o le$$e, which is impo$$ible: Therefore the
Mixt-Triangle is not le$$e than one third of the Rectangle C P.
I $ay likewi$e, that it is not more: For if it be more than one
third of the Rectangle C P, $uppo$e the Space X equal to the ex-
ce$$e of the Triangle above the third part of the $aid Rectangle
C P, and the divi$ion and $ubdivi$ion of the Rectangle into Rect-
angolets, but alwaies equal, being made, we $hall meet with $uch as
that one of them is le$$er than the Space X; which let be done:
and let the Rectangle <I>B</I> O be le$$er than X; and, having de$cribed
the Figure as before, we $hall have in$cribed in the Mixt-Triangle
a Figure compounded of the Rectangles V O, T N, S M, N L, Q K,
which yet $hall not be le$s
<fig>
than the third part of the
great Rectangle C P, for
the Mixt Triangle doth
much le$$e exceed the In-
$cribed Figure than it doth
exceed the third part of
the Rectangle C P; Be-
cau$e the exce$$e of the
Triangle above the third part of the Rectangle C P is equal to
the Space X which is greater than the Rectangle <I>B</I> O, and this al-
$o is con$iderably greater than the exce$$e of the Triangle above
the In$cribed Figure: For to the Rectangle <I>B</I> O, all the Rectan-
golets A G, G E, E <I>F,</I> F H, H I, I <I>B</I> are equal, of which the Ex-
ce$$es of the Triangle above the In$cribed <I>F</I>igure are le$$e than
half: And therefore the Triangle exceeding the third part of the
Rectangle C P, by much more (exceeding it by the Space X)
than it exceedeth its in$cribed <I>F</I>igure, that $ame <I>F</I>igure $hall al$o
be greater than the third part of the Rectangle C P: <I>B</I>ut it is le$$er,
by the Lemma pre$uppo$ed: <I>F</I>or that the Rectangle C P, as being
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>127</p>
the Aggregate of all the bigge$t Rectangles, hath the $ame pro-
portion to the Rectangles compounding the In$cribed <I>F</I>igure, that
the Aggregate of of all the Squares of the Lines equal to the big-
ge$t, hath to the Squares of the Lines that exceed equally, $ub$tra-
cting the Square of the bigge$t: And therefore (as it hapneth in
Squares) the whole Aggregate of the bigge$t (that is the Rectan-
gle C P) is more than triple the Aggregate of the exceeding
ones, the bigge$t deducted, that compound the In$cribed <I>F</I>i-
gure. Therefore the Mixt-Triangle is neither greater nor le$$er
than the third part of the Rectangle C P: It is therefore equal.</P>
<P>SAGR. A pretty and ingenuous Demon$tration: and $o much

Gravity of Solids.</P>

that hath been written by the mo$t <I>F</I>amous Geometricians of the

mick,</I> it made him de$i$t from pro$ecuting his Di$coveries that he

<P>SAGR. I was informed of all the$e things by our <I>Academick</I>;
and have be$ought him withall that he would one day let me $ee

with the <I>B</I>ook of <I>Valerius:</I> but I never was $o happy as to $ee them.</P>
<P>SALV. I have a Copy of them, and will impart them to you,
for you will be much plea$ed to $ee the variety of Methods, which
the$e two Authors take to inve$tigate the $ame Conclu$ions, and
their Demon$trations: wherein al$o $ome of the Conclu$ions have
different Explanations, howbeit in effect equally true.</P>
<P>SAGR. I $hall be very glad to $ee them, therefore when you re-
turn to our wonted Conferences you may do me the favour to
bring them with you. <I>B</I>ut in the mean time, this $ame of the Re-
fi$tance of the Solid taken from the Pri$me by a Parabolick Secti-
on, being an Operation no le$$e ingenuous than beneficial in many
Mechanical Works, it would be good that Artificers had $ome ea-
$ie and expedite Rule how they may draw the $aid Parabolick

<P>SALV. There are $everal waies to draw tho$e Lines, but two

One of which is truly admirable, $ince that thereby, in le$$e time
than another can with Compa$$es $lightly draw upon a paper
four or $ix Circles of different $izes, I can de$ign thirty or forty
Parabolick Lines no le$$e exact, $mall, and $mooth than the Cir-
cumferences of tho$e Circles. I have a <I>B</I>all of <I>B</I>ra$$e exqui$itely
round, no bigger than a Nut, this thrown upon a Steel Mirrour
held, not erect to the Horizon, but $omewhat inclined, $o that the
<I>B</I>all in its motion may run along pre$$ing lightly upon it, leaveth
a Parabolical Line finely and $moothly de$cribed, and wider or
narrower according as the Projection $hall be more or le$s elevated.
Whereby al$o we have a clear and $en$ible Experiment that the
Motion of Projects is made by Parabolick Lines: an Effect ob$er-
ved by none before our <I>Academick,</I> who al$o layeth down the
Demon$tration of it in his <I>B</I>ook of Motion, which we will joynt-
ly peru$e at our next meeting. Now the <I>B</I>all, that it may de$cribe
by its motion tho$e Parabola's, mu$t be rouled a little in the hands
that it may be warmed, and $omewhat moy$tned, for by this
means it will leave its track more apparent upon the Mirrour. The
other way to draw the Line that we de$ire upon the Pri$me is after
this manner. Let two Nailes be fa$tned on high in a Wall, at an
equal di$tance from the Horizon, and remote from one another
twice the breadth of the Rectangle upon which we would trace the
Semiparabola, and to the$e two Nails tye a $mall thread of $uch a
length that its doubling may reach as far as the length of the
Pri$me; this $tring will hang in a Parabolick <I>F</I>igure: $o that tra-
cing out upon the Wall the way that the $aid String maketh on it,
we $hall have a whole Parabola de$cribed: which a Perpendicular
that hangeth in the mid$t between the$e two Nailes will divide
into two equal parts. And for the transferring or $etting off of
that Line afterwards upon the oppo$ite Surfaces of the Pri$me it is
not difficult at all, $o that every indifferent Arti$t will know how
to do it. The $ame Line might be drawn upon the $aid Sur-
face of the Pri$me by help of the Geometrical Lines delineated up-
on the <I>Compa$$e</I> of our <I>Friend,</I> without any more ado.</P>
<P>We have hitherto demon$trated $o many Conclu$ions touching
the Contemplation of the$e Re$i$tances of Solids again$t Fraction
by having fir$t opened the way unto the Science with $uppo$ing the
direct Re$i$tance for known, that we may in pur$uance of them
proceed forwards to the finding of other, and other Conclu$ions,
with their Demon$trations of tho$e which in Nature are infinite.
Only at pre$ent, for a final conclu$ion of this daies Conferences,
I will add the Speculation of the Re$i$tances of the Hollow Solids
which Art, and chiefly Nature, u$eth in an hundred Operations,
when without encrea$ing the weight $he greatly augmenteth the
$trength: as is $een in the Bones of Birds, and in many Canes that
<foot>are</foot>
<p n=>123</p>
are light and of great Re$i$tance again$t bending and breaking.
For if a Wheat Straw that $upports an Ear that is heavier than the
whole Stalk, were made of the $ame quantity of matter but were
ma$$ie or $olid, it would be much le$$e repugnant to Fraction or
Flection. And with the $ame Rea$on Art hath ob$erved, and Ex-
perience confirmed, that an hollow Cane, or a Trunk of Wood
or Metal, is much more firm and tough than if being of the $ame
weight and length it were $olid, which con$equently would be
more flender, and therefore Art hath contrived to make Lances hol-
low within when they are de$ired to be $trong and light. We will
$hew therefore, that</P>
<head>PROPOSITION XV.</head>
<P><I>The Re$i$tances of two Cylinders, equall, and equally
long, one of which is Hollow, and the other Ma$sie,
have to each other the $ame proportion, as their Dia-
meters.</I></P>
<P>Let the Cane or Hollow Cylinder be A E, [<I>as in</I> Fig. 17.]
and the Cylinder I N Ma$$ie, and equall in weight and length.
I $ay, the Re$i$tance of the Cane A E hath the $ame propor-
tion to the Re$i$tance of the $olid Cylinder, as the Diameter
A B hath to the Diameter I L. Which is very manife$t; For the
Cane and the Cylinder I N being equal, and of equal lengths, the
Circle I L that is Ba$e of the Cylinder $hall be equal to the Ring
A B that is Ba$e of the Cane A E, (I call the Superficies that re-
maineth when a le$$er Circle is taken out of a greater that is Con-
centrick with it a Ring:) and therefore their Ab$olute Re$i$tan-
ces $hall be equal: but becau$e in breaking cro$$e-waies we make
u$e in the Cylinder I N of the length L N for a Leaver, and of the
point L for a Fulciment, and of the Semidiameter or Diameter L I
for a Counter-Leaver; and in the Cane the part of the Leaver,
that is the Line B E is equal to L N; but the Counter-Leaver at
the Fulciment B is the Diameter or Semidiameter A B: It is mani-
fe$t therefore that the Re$i$tance of the Cane exceedeth that of
the Solid Cylinder as much as the Diameter A B exceeds the Dia-
meter I L; Which is that that we $ought. Toughne$s therefore is ac-
quired in the hollow Cane above the Toughne$s of the $olid Cylin-
der according to the proportion of the Diameters: provided al-
waies that they be both of the $ame matter, weight, and length.</P>
<P>It would be well, that in con$equence of this we try to inve$tigate
that which hapneth in other Ca$es indifferently between all Canes
and $olid Cylinders of equal length, although unequal in quantity
of weight, and more or le$s evacuated. And fir$t we will demon-

<P><I>A Trunk or Hollow Cane being given, a Solid Cylinder

<P>This Operation is very ea$ie. For let the Line A B, be the Dia-

Cavity. Let the Line A E be $et off upon the greater Circle
equal to the Diameter C D, and conjoyn E B. And becau$e in

the Semicircle A E B the Angle E is Right-
Angle, the Circle who$e Diameter is A B
$hall be equall to the two Circles of the Di-
ameters A E and E B: But A E is the Dia-
meter of the Hollow of the Cane: Therefore
the Circle who$e Diameter is E B, $hall be
equal to the Ring A C B D: And therefore
the $olid Cylinder, the Circle of who$e Ba$e

<P><I>To find what proportion is betwixt the Re$i$tances of

<P>LET the Cane A B E, and the Cylinder R S M, be of equal
length: it is required to find what proportion the Re$i$tances
have to each other. By the precedent let the Cylinder I L N
be found equal to the Cane, and of the $ame length; and to the
Lines I L and R S (Diameters of the Ba$es of the Cylinders I N and
<fig>
R M) let the Line V be a fourth
Proportional. I $ay, the Re$i$tance
of the Cane A E is to the Re$i-
$tance of the Cylinder R M, as the
Line A B is to V. For the Cane
A E being equal to, and of the
$ame length with the Cylinder
I N, the Re$i$tance of the Cane
$hall be to the Re$i$tance of the
Cylinder, as the Line A B is to I L:
But the Re$i$tance of the Cylinder I N is to the Re$i$tance of the
Cylinder R M, as the Cube I L is to the Cube R S; that is, as the
Line I L to V: Therefore, <I>ex &aelig;quali,</I> the Re$i$tance of the Cane

<P><I>We promote a very new Science, but of a very
old Subject. There is nothing in Nature more
antient than</I> MOTION, <I>of which
many and great Volumns have been written
by Philo$ophers: But yet there are $undry
Symptomes and Properties in it worthy of
our Notice, which I find not to have been hi-
therto ob$erved, much le$$e demon$trated by

ted: as that the Natural Motion of Grave Bodies continually accelle-</I>
<foot><I>rateth,</I></foot>

<I>rateth, as they de$cend towards their Center: but it hath not been as yet
declared in what proportion that Acceleration is made. For no man,
that I know, hath ever demon$trated, That there is the $ame proportion
between the Spaces, thorow which a thing moveth in equal Times, as
there is between the Odde Numbers which follow in order after a Vnite.
It hath been ob$erved that Projects [or things thrown or darted with vi-
olence] make a Line that is $omewhat curved; but that this line is a Pa-
rabola, none have hinted: Yet the$e, and $undry other things, no
le$$e worthy of our knowledg, will I here demon$trate: And which
is more, I will open a way to a mo$t ample and excellent Science,
of which the$e our Labours $hall be the Elements: into which more
$ubtil and piercing Wits than mine will be better able to dive.</I></P>
<P><I>We divide this Treati$e into three parts. In the fir$t part we con$ider

for it may happen, that a Moveable may pa$$e thorow equal Spaces in cer-
tain equal Times, though the Spaces be not equal which it hath gone in

<P>If a Moveable moving with an Equable Motion,
and with the $ame Velocity pa$$e two $everal
Spaces, the Times of the Motion $hall be to
one another as the $aid Spaces.</P>
<P><I>Let the Moveable by an Equable Motion with the $ame Velocity pa&szlig;
the two Spaces A B and B C: and let D E be the Time of the Moti-
on thorow A B; and let the Time of the Motion thorow B C be E F
I $ay that the Time D E to the Time E F, is as the Space A B to the
Space B C. Protract the Spaces and Times on both $ides, towards
G H and I K, and in A G take any number of Spaces equal to A B,</I>
<fig>
<I>and in D I the like number of Times equal to D E. Again, in C H take
any number of Spaces equal to B C, and in F K take the $ame number
of Times equal to the Time E F. This done, the Space B G will con-
tain ju$t as many Spaces equal to B A, as the Time E I containeth
Times equal to E D, equimultiplied according to what ever Rate; And
likewi$e the Space B H will contain as many Spaces equal to B C, as</I>
<foot><I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>128</p>
<I>the Time K E containeth Times equal to F E, at what ever rate equi-
multiplied. And fora$much as D E is the Time of the Motion thorow
A B, the whole Time E I, $hall be the Time of the whole Space of the
Motion thorow B G, by rea$on that the Motion is Equable, and that the
number of the Times in E I equal to D E, is the $ame with the number
of Spaces in B G, equal to B A: For the $ame rea$on E K is the Time
of the Motion thorow H B. Now in regard the Motion is Equable, if the
Space G B were equal to H B, the Time I E would be equal to E K:
and if G B be greater than B H, I E $hall likewi$e be greater than E K:
and if le$$er, le$$er. They are therefore four Magnitudes; A B the fir$t,
B C the $econd, D E the third, and E F the Fourth; and the fir$t
and third, to wit, the Space A B, and Time D E, there were taken the
Time I E, and the Space G B equimultiple, according to any multi-
plication; and it hath been demon$trated that the$e do at once either
equal, or fall $hort of, or el$e exceed the Time E K, and Space B H,
which are equimultiple of the $econd and fourth: Therefore the fir$t
bath to the $econd, to wit the Space A B to the Space B C, the $ame
proportion that the third hath to the fourth, to wit, the Time D E to
the Time E F. Which was to be demon$trated.</I></P>

<P>If a Moveable in equal Times pa$$e thorow two

<P><I>Let us $uppo$e A B and B C in the former Figure, to be two
Spaces pa$t, by the Moveable in equal times; the Space A B with
the Velocity D E, and the Space B C with the Velocity E F. I
$ay, that the Space A B is to the Space B C, as the Velocity D E is to
the Velocity E F: and thus I prove it. Take as before, of the Spaces
and Velocities equi-multiples, accordieg to any what ever Rate, $ci-
licet G B and I E, of A B and D E, and likewi$e H B and K E, of
B C and E F: It may be concluded as above, that G B and I E are

<P>SALV. This that we have read, is what our ^{*} <I>Author</I> hath written
of the Equable Motion. We will pa$s therefore to a more $ubtil and
new Contemplation touching the Motion Naturally Accelerate:
and behold here the Title and Introduction.</P>
<head>OF MOTION
NATVRALLY ACCELERATE.</head>
<P><I>In the former Book we have con$idered the Accidents which ac-
company Equable Motion; we are now to treat of another kind of
Motion which we call Accelerate. And fir$t it will be expedient to
find out and explain a Definition be$t agreeing to that which Nature
makes u$e of. For though it be not nconvenient to feign a Motion at plea-
$ure, and then to con$ider the Accidents that attend it (as tho$e have
done, who having framed in their imagination Helixes and Conchoi-
des, which are Lines ari$ing from certain Motions, although not u$ed
by Nature, and upon that Suppo$ition have laudably demon$trated the
Symptomes thereof) yet in regard that Nature maketh u$e of a certain
kind of Acceleration in the de$cent of Grave Bodies, we are re$olved to
$earch out and contemplate the pa$$ions thereof, and $ee whether the
Definition that we are about to produce of this our Accelerate Motion,
doth aptly and congruou$ly $ute with the E$$ence of Motion Naturally
Accelerate. After many long and laborious Studies we have found out
a Definition which $eemeth to expre$$e the true nature of this Accelerate
Motion, in regard that all the Natural Experiments that fall under
the Ob$ervation of our Sen$es, do agree with tho$e its properties that
we intend anon to demon$trate. In this Di$qui$ition we have been a$$i-
$ted, and as it were led by the hand by that ob$ervation of the u$ual
Method and common procedure of Nature her $elf in her other Operati-
ons, wherein $he con$tantly makes u$e of the Fir$t, Simple$t, and Ea-
$ie$t Means that are: for I believe that no man can think that Swim-
ming or flying can be performed in a more $imple or ea$ie way, than that
which Fi$hes and Birds do u$e out of a Natural In$tinct. Why there-
fore $hall not I be per$waded, that, when I $ee a Stone to acquire conti-
nually new additions of Velocity in its de$cending from its Re$t out of $ome
high place, this encrea$e made in the $imple$t ea$ie$t and mo$t obvious
manner that we can imagine? Now if we $eriou$ly examine all the ways
that can be devi$ed, we $hall find no encrea$es, no acqui$itions
le$$e intricate or more intelligible than that which ever encrea$eth or
makes its additions after the $ame manner. This appeareth by the great</I>
Affinity <I>that is between Time and Motion. For as the Equability or
Vniformity of Motion is defined and expre$$ed by the Equability of the</I>
<foot><I>Times</I></foot>
<p n=>133</p>
<I>Times and Spaces, (for we call that Motion or Lation Equable, by which
equal Spaces are pa$t in equal Times) $o by the $ame Equability of the
parts of Time, we may perceive, that the encrea$e of Celerity in the Natu-
ral Motion of Grave Bodies, is made after a Simple and plain manner;
conceiving in our Mind that their Motion is continually accelerated uni-
formly and at the $ame Rate, whil$t equal additions of Celerity are
conferred upon them in all equal Times. So that taking any equal par-
ticles of Time beginning from the fir$t In$tant in which the Moveable
departeth from Re$t, and entereth upon its De$cent, the Degree of
Velocity acquired in the fir$t and $econd Particles of Time, is double the
degree of Velocity that the Moveable acquired in the fir$t Particle: and
the degree of Velocity that it acquireth in three Particles, is triple, and
that in four quadruple to the $ame Degree of the fir$t Time: As, for
our better under$tanding, if a Moveable $hould continue its Motion
according to the degree or moment of Velocity acquired in the fir$t Parti-
cle of Time, and $hould extend its cour$e equably with that $ame De-
gree; this Motion would be twice as $low as that which it would obtain
according to the degree of Velocity acquired in two Particles of Time:
So that it will not be improper if we under$tand the Intention of the Ve-
locity, to proceed according to the Exten$ion of the Time. From whence
we may frame this Definition of the Motion of which we are about to
<*>eat.</I></P>
<head>DEFINITION.</head>
<P>Motion Accelerate in an Equable or Vniform
Proportion, I call that which departing from
Re$t, $uperaddeth equal moments of Velocity
in equal Times.</P>
<P>SAGR. Though it were Irrational for me to oppo$e this or any
other Definition a$$igned by any what$oever Author, they being all
Arbitrary, yet I may very well, without any offence, que$tion whe-
ther this Definition, which is under$tood and admitted in Ab$tract,
doth $ute, agree, and hold true in that $ort of Accelerate Motion,
which Grave Bodies de$cending naturally do exerci$e. And becau$e
the Authour $eemeth to promi$e us, that the Natural Motion of
Grave Bodies is $uch as he hath defined it, I could wi$h that $ome
Scruples were removed that trouble my mind; that $o I might apply
my $elf afterwards with greater attention to the Proportions and
Demon$trations which are expected.</P>
<P>SALV. I like well, that you and <I>Simplicius</I> do propound
Doubts as they come in the way: which I do imagine will be the
<foot>$ame</foot>
<p n=>134</p>
$ame that I my $elf did meet with when I fir$t read this Treati$e,
and that, either were re$olved by conferring with the Author, or
removed by my own con$idering of them.</P>
<P>SAGR. Whil$t I am fancying to my $elf a Grave De$cending
Moveable to depart from Re$t, that is from the privation of all
Velocity, and to enter into Motion, and in that to go encrea-
$ing, according to the proportion after which the Time encrea$eth
from the fir$t in$tant of the Motion; and to have <I>v. gr.</I> in eight
Pul$ations, acquired eight degrees of Velocity, of which in the
fourth Pul$ation it had gained four, in the $econd two, in the
fir$t one, Time being $ubdivi$ible <I>in infinitum,</I> it followeth, that
the Antecedent Velocity alwayes dimini$hing at that Rate, there
will bt no degree of Velocity $o $mall, or, if you will, of Tardity
$o great, in which the $aid Moveable is not found to be con$ti-
tuted, after its departure from infinite Tardity, that is, from
Re$t. So that if that degree of Velocity which it had at four Pul-
$ations of Time, was $uch, that maintaining it Equable, it would
have run two Miles in an hour, and with the degree of Velocity
that it had in the $econd Pul$ation, it would have gone one mile
an hour, it mu$t be granted, that in the In$tants of Time neeter
and neerer to its fir$t In$tant of moving from Re$t, it is $o $low,
as that (continuing to move with that Tardity) it would not have
pa$$ed a Mile in an hour, nor in a day, nor in a year, nor in a
thou$and; nay, nor have gone one $ole foot in a greater time:
An accident to which me thinks the Imagination but very unea-
$ily accords, $eeing that Sen$e $heweth us, that a Grave Falling
Body commeth down $uddenly, and with great Velocity.</P>
<P>SALV. This is one of tho$e Doubts that al$o fell in my way
upon my fir$t thinking on this affair, but not long after I remo-
ved it: and that removal was the effect of the $elf $ame Expe-
riment which at pre$ent $tarts it to you. You $ay, that in your
opinion, Experience $heweth that the Moveable hath no $ooner
departed from Re$t, but it entereth into a very notable Velocity:
and I $ay, that this very Experiment proves it to us, that the fir$t
Impetus's of the Cadent Body, although it be very heavy, are
mo$t $lack and $low. Lay a Grave Body upon $ome yielding mat-
ter, and let it continue upon it till it hath pre$$ed into it as far as
it can with its $imple Gravity; it is manife$t, that rai$ing it a yard
or two, and then letting it fall upon the $ame matter, it $hall
with its percu$$ion make a new pre$$ure, and greater than that
made at fir$t by its meer weight: and the effect $hall be cau$ed
by the falling Moveable conjoyned with the Velocity acquired in
the Fall: which impre$$ion $hall be greater and greater, accord-
ing as the Percu$$ion $hall come from a greater height; that is,
according as the Velocity of the Percutient $hall be greater. We
<foot>may</foot>
<p n=>135</p>
may therefore without mi$take conjecture the quantity of the Ve-
locity of a falling heavy Body; by the quality and quantity of
the Percu$$ion. But tell me Sirs, that Beetle which being let fall
upon a Stake from an height of four yards, driveth it into the
ground, <I>v. gr.</I> four inches, comming from an height of two yards,
$hall drive it much le$$e, and le$$e from an height of one, and
le$$e from a foot; and la$tly lifting it up an inch, what will it do
more than if without any blow it were laid upon it? Certainly
but very little, and the operation would be wholly impercep-
tible, if it were rai$ed the thickne$$e of a leaf. And becau$e the
effect of the Percu$$ion is regulated by the Velocity of the Percu-
tient, who will que$tion but that the Motion is very $low, and
the Velocity extreme $mall, where its operation is impercep-
tible? See now of what power Truth is, $ince the $ame Experi-
ment that $eemed at the fir$t blu$h to hold forth one thing, be-
ing better con$idered, a$certains us of the contrary. But without
having recour$e to that Experiment (which without doubt is mo$t
per$wa$ive) me-thinks that it is not hard to penetrate $uch a
Truth as this by meer Di$cour$e. We have an heavy $tone $u-
$tained in the Air at Re$t: let it be di$engaged from its uphol-
der, and $et at liberty; and, as being more grave than the Air, it
goeth de$cending downwards, and that not with a Motion Equa-
ble, but $low in the beginning, and continually afterwards ac-
celerate: and $eeing that the Velocity is Augmentable and Di-
mini$hable <I>in infinitum,</I> what Rea$on $hall per$wade me, that that
Moveable departing from an infinite Tardity (for $uch is Re$t)
entereth immediately into ten degrees of Velocity, rather than in
one of four, or in this more than in one of two, of one, of half
one, or of the hundredth part of one; and to be $hort, in all
the infinite le$$er? Pray you hear me. I do not think that you
would $cruple to grant me, that the acqui$t of the Degrees of Ve-
locity of the falling Stone may be made with the $ame Order as
is the Diminution and lo$$e of the $ame degrees, when with an
impellent Virtue it is driven upwards to the $ame height: But if
that be $o, I do not $ee how it can be $uppo$ed that in the diminu-
tion of the Velocity of the a$cendent Stone, $pending it all, it
can come to the $tate of Re$t before it hath pa$$ed thorow all the
degrees of Tardity.</P>
<P>SIMP. But if the greater and greater degrees of Tardity are
infinite, it $hall never $pend them all; $o that the a$cendent
Grave will never attain to Re$t, but will move <I>ad infinitum,</I> $till
retarding: a thing which we $ee not to happen.</P>
<P>SALV. This would happen, <I>Simplicius,</I> in ca$e the Moveable
$hould $tay for $ome time in each degree: but it pa$$eth thorow
them, without $taying longer than an in$tant in any of them.
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>136</p>
And becau$e in every quantitative Time, though never $o $mall,
there are infinite In$tants, therefore they are $ufficient to an$wer
to the infinite degrees of Velocity dimini$hed. And that the
a$cendent Grave Body per$i$ts not for any quantitative Time in
one and the $ame degree of Velocity, may thus be made out:
Becau$e, a certain quantitative Time being a$$igned it in the fir$t
in$tant of that Time, and likewi$e in the la$t, the Moveable
$hould be found to have one and the $ame degree of Velocity, it
might by this $econd degree be likewi$e driven upwards $uch an-
other Space, like as from the fir$t it was tran$ported to the $e-
cond; and by the $ame rea$on it would pa$$e from the $econd to
the third, and, in $hort, would continue its Motion Uniform <I>ad
infinitum.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. From this Di$cour$e, as I conceive, one might derive a
very appo$ite Rea$on of the Que$tion controverted among$t Philo.
$ophers, Touching what $hould be the Cau$e of the acceleration
of the Natural Motion of Grave Moveables. For when I confider
in the Grave Body driven upwards, its continual Diminution of
that Virtue impre$$ed upon it by the Projicient, which $o long as
it was $uperiour to that other contrary one of Gravity, forced it
upwards, this and that being come to an <I>Equilibrium,</I> the Move-
able cea$eth to ri$e any higher, and pa$$eth thorow the $tate of
Re$t, in which the <I>Impetus</I> impre$$ed is not annihilated, but one-
ly that exce$$e is $pent, which it before had above the Gravity of
the Moveable, whereby prevailing over the $ame, it did drive
it upwards. And the Diminution of this forrein <I>Impetus</I> continu-
ing, and con$equently the advantage beginning to be on the part
of the Gravity, the De$cent al$o beginneth but $low, in regard
of the oppo$ition of the Virtue impre$$ed, a con$iderable part of
which $till remaineth in the Moveable: but becau$e it doth go
continually dimini$hing, and is $till with a greater and greater
proportion overcome by the Gravity, hence ari$eth the continual
Acceleration of the Motion.</P>
<P>SIMP. The conceit is witty, but more $ubtil than $olid: for in
ca$e it were concludent, it $alveth onely tho$e Natural Motions
to which a Violent Motion preceded, in which part of the extern
Virtue $till remains in force: but where there is no $uch remaining
impul$e, as where the Moveable departeth from a long Quie$-
cence, the $trength of your whole Di$cour$e vani$heth.</P>
<P>SAGR. I believe that you are in an Errour, and that this Di-
$tinction of Ca$es which you make, is needle$$e, or, to $ay bet-
ter, <I>Null.</I> Therefore tell me, whether may there be impre$$ed
on the Project by the Projicient $ometimes much, and $ometimes
little Vertue; $o as that it may be $tricken upwards an hundred
yards, and al$o twenty, or four, or one?</P>
<foot>SIMP.</foot>
<p n=>137</p>
<P>SIMP. No doubt but there may.</P>
<P>SAGR. And no le$$e po$$ible is it, that the $aid Virtue impre$$ed
$hall $o little $eperate the Re$i$tance of the Gravity, as not to
rai$e the Project above an inch: and finally the Virtue of the
Projicient may be onely $o much, as ju$t to equalize and com-
pen$ate the Re$i$tance of the Gravity, $o as that the Moveable
is not driven upwards, but onely $u$tained. So that when you
hold a Stone in your hand, what el$e do you, but impre$$e on it
$o much Virtue impelling upwards, as is the faculty of its Gra-
vity drawing downwards? And this your Virtue, do you not
continue to keep it impre$$ed on the Stone all the time that you
hold it in your hand? What $ay you, is it dimini$hed by your
long holding it? And this $u$tention which impedeth the Stones
de$cent, what doth it import, whether it be made by your hand,
or by a Table, or by a Rope, that $u$pends it? Doubtle$$e no
thing at all. Conclude with your $elf therefore, <I>Simplicius,</I> that
the precedence of a long, a $hort, or a Momentary Re$t to the
Fall of the Stone, makes no alteration at all, $o that the Stone
$hould not alwaies depart affected with $o much Virtue contrary
to Gravity, as did exactly $uffice to have kept it in Re$t.</P>
<P>SALV. I do not think it a $ea$onable time at pre$ent to enter
upon the Di$qui$ition of the Cau$e of the Acceleration of Natu-
ral Motion: touching which $undry Philo$ophers have produced
$undry opinions: $ome reducing it to the approximation unto
the Center others to the le$$e parts of the <I>Medium</I> $ucce$$ively re-
maining to be perforated; others to a certain Extru$ion of the
Ambient <I>Medium,</I> which in reuniting upon the back of the
Moveable, goeth driving and continually thru$ting it; which
Fancies, and others of the like nature, it would be nece$$ary to
examine, and with $mall benefit to an$wer. It $erveth our Au-
thours turn at the pre$ent, that we under$tand that he will de-
clare and demon$trate to us $ome Pa$$ions of an Accelerate Mo-
tion (be the Cau$e of its Acceleration what it will) $o as that the
Moments of its Velocity do go encrea$ing, after its departure from
Re$t with that mo$t $imple proportion wherewith the Continua-
tion of the Time doth encrea$e: which is as much as to $ay, that
in equal Times there are made equal additaments of Velocity.
And if it $hall be found, that the Accidents that $hall hereafter
be demon$trated, do hold true in the Motion of Naturally De-
$cendent and Accelerate Grave Moveables, we may account,
that the a$$umed Definition taketh in that Motion of Grave Bo-
dies, and that it is true, that their Acceleration doth encrea$e ac-
cording as the Time and Duration of the Motion encrea$eth.</P>
<P>SAGR. By what as yet is $et before my Intellectuals, it appears
to me that one might with (haply) more plainne$$e define, and yet
<foot>T never</foot>
<p n=>138</p>
never alter the Conceit; $aying that, A Motion uniformly accele-
rate is that in which the Velocity goeth encrea$ing according as
the Space encrea$eth that is pa$$ed thorow: So that, for example,
the degree of Velocity acquired by the Moveable in a de$cent of
four yards $hould be double to that that it would have after it had
de$cended a Space of two, and this double to that acquired in the
Space of the fir$t Yard. For I do not think that it can be doubted,
but that that Grave Moveable which falleth from an height of $ix
yards hath, and percu$$eth with an <I>Impetus</I> double to that which
it had when it had de$cended three yards, and triple to that which
it had at two, and $extuple to that had in the Space of one.</P>
<P>SALV. I comfort my $elf in that I have had $uch a Companion
in my Errour: and I will tell you farther, that your Di$cour$e hath
$o much of likelihood and probability in it, that our Author him$elf
did not deny unto me, when I propo$ed it to him, that he likewi$e
had been for $ome time in the $ame mi$take. <I>B</I>ut that which I af-
terwards extreamly wondred at, was to $ee in four plain words,
di$covered, not only the falfity, but impo$$ibility of two Propo$i-
tions that carry with them $o much of $eeming truth, that having
propounded them to many, I never met with any one but did freely
admit them to be $o.</P>
<P>SIMP. Certainly I $hould be of the number, and that the De-
$cendent Grave Moveable <I>vires acquir at eundo,</I> encrea$ing its Ve-
locity at the rate of the Space, and that the Moment of the $ame
Percutient is double, coming from a double height, $eem to me Pro-
po$itions to be granted without any h&aelig;$itation or controver$ie.</P>
<P>SALV. And yet they are as fal$e and impo$$ible, as that Moti-
on is made in an in$tant. And hear a clear proof of the $ame. In
ca$e the Velocities have the $ame proportion as the Spaces pa$$ed,
or to be pa$$ed, tho$e Spaces $hall be pa$$ed in equal Times: if
therefore the Velocities with which the falling Moveable pa$$eth
the Space of four yards, were double to the Velocities with which it
pa$$eth the two fir$t yards (like as the Space is double to the Space)
then the Times of tho$e Tran$itions are equal: but the $ame Move-
able's pa$$ing the four yards, and the two in one and the $ame Time,
hath place only in In$tantaneous Motion. <I>B</I>ut we $ee, that the
falling grave <I>B</I>ody maketh its Motion in Time, and pa$$eth the two
yards in a le$$er than it doth the four. Therefore it is fal$e that its
Velocity encrea$eth as its Space. The other Propo$ition is demon-
$trated to be fal$e with the $ame per$picuity. For that which per-
cu$$eth being the $ame, the difference and Moment of the Percu$$ton
cannot be determined but by the difference of Velocity; If there-
fore the percutient, coming from a double height, make a Percu$$i-
on with a double Moment, it is nece$$ary that it $trike with a dou-
ble Velocity: <I>B</I>ut the double Velocity pa$$eth the double Space in
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>139</p>
the $ame Time; and we $ee the Time of the De$cent from the grea-
ter altitude to be longer.</P>
<P>SAGR. This is too great an Evidence, too great a Facility
wherewith you manife$t ab$truce Conclu$ions: this extream ea$i-

cations.</P>
<P>SALV. To tho$e which with great brevity and clarity $hew the
fallacies of Propo$itions that have been commonly received for
true by the generality of people, it would be a very tolerable in-
jury to return them only $lighting in$tead of thanks: but there is
much di$plea$ure and mole$tation in another certain affection
$ometimes found in $ome men, that pretending in the $ame Studies
at lea$t Parity with any whom$oever, do $ee that they have let
pa$s $uch and $uch for true Conclu$ions, which afterwards by
another, with a $hort and ea$ie di$qui$ition, have been detected and
convicted for fal$e. I will not call that affection Envy, that is ac-
cu$tomed to convert in time to hatred and de$pite again$t the di$-
coverers of $uch Fallacies, but I will call it an itch, and a de$ire to
be able rather to maintain their inveterate Errours, than to per-
mit the reception of new-di$covered Truths. Which humour $ome-
times induceth them to write in contradiction of tho$e truths
which are but too perfectly known unto them$elves only to keep
the Reputation of others low in the opinion of the numerous and

impart them to us, when a particular Meeting $hall be appointed

falleth upon the Horizontal Line produced along by the
lower term of the $aid Plane inclined: as for better under$tanding;
the Line A B being parallel to the Horizon, upon which let the two
<fig>
Planes C A, and C D be inclined:
the Perpendicular C B falling up-
on the Horizontal Line B A the
Author calleth the Elevation
of the Planes C A and C D;
and $uppo$eth that the degrees of
Velocity of the $ame Moveable
de$cending along the inclined Planes C A and C D, acqui-
red in the Terms A and D are equal, for that their Elevation is
the $ame C B. And $o great al$o ought the degree of Velocity be
under$tood to be which the $ame Moveable falling from the Point
C would acquire in the term B.</P>
<P>SAGR. The truth is, this Suppo$ition hath in it $o much of pro-
bability, that it de$erveth to be granted without di$pute, alwaies
pre$uppo$ing that all accidental and extern Impediments are re-
moved, and that the Planes be very Solid and Ter$e, and the Move-
able in Figure mo$t perfectly Rotund, $o that neither the Plane,
nor the Moveable have any unevenne$s. All Contra$ts and Im-
pediments, I $ay, being removed, the light of Nature dictates to
me without any difficulty, that a Ball heavy and perfectly round
de$cending by the Lines C A, C D, and C B would come to the
terms A D, and B with equal <I>Impetus's.</I></P>
<P>SALV. You argue very probably; but over and above the pro-
bability, I will by an Experiment $o increa$e the likelihood, as that
it wants but little of being equal to a very nece$$ary Demon$trati-
on. Imagine this leafe of Paper to be a Wall erect at Right-angles
to the Horizon, and at a Nail, fa$tned in the $ame, hang a Ball or
Plummet of Lead, weighing an ounce or two, $u$pended by the
$mall thread A B, two or three yards long, perpendicular to the
Horizon: and on the Wall draw an Horizontal Line D C, cutting
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>141</p>
the Perpendicular A B at Right angles, which A B mu$t hang two
Inches, or thereabouts, from the Wall: Then transferring the
$tring A B with the Ball into C, let go the $aid Ball; which you will
<fig>
$ee fir$t to de$cend
de$cribing C B D, and
to pa$s $o far beyond
the Term B, that run-
ning along the Arch
B D it will ri$e almo$t
as high as the de$igned
Parallel C D, wanting
but a very $mall mat-
ter of reaching to it,
the preci$e arrival thi-
ther being denied it by
the Impediment of the Air, and of the Thread. From which we
may truly conclude, that the <I>Impetus</I> acquired in the point B by
the Ball in its de$cent along the Arch C B, was $o much as $ufficed
to carry it upwards along $uch another Arch B D unto the $ame
height: having made, and often reiterated this Experiment, let
us drive into the Wall, along which the Perpendicular A B pa$$eth,
another Nail, as in E or in F, which is to $tand out five or $ix In-
ches; and this to the end that the thread A B, returning as before
to carry back the Ball C along the Arch C B, when it is come to
B, the Thread $topping at the Nail E may be con$trained to move
along the Circumference B G, de$cribed about the Center E: by
which we $hall $ee what that $ame <I>Impetus</I> is able to do, which be-
fore, being conceived in the $ame term B, carried the $ame Move-
able along the Arch B D unto the height of the Horizontal Line
C D. Now, Sirs, you $hall with delight $ee the Ball carried unto
the Horizontal Line in the Point G; and the $ame will happen if
the $top be placed lower, as in F, where the Ball would de$cribe
the Arch B I, evermore terminating its a$cent exactly in the Line
C D: and in ca$e the Check were $o low that the overplus of the
thread beneath it cannot reach to the height of C D, (which would
happen if it were nearer to the point B than to the inter$ection of
A B with the Horizontal Line C D) then the thread would
whirle and twine about the Nail. This experiment leaveth no
place for our doubting of the truth of the Suppo$ition: for the
two Arches C B and D B being equall, and $cituate alike, the
acqui$t of Moment made along the De$cent in the Arch C B, is
the $ame with that made along the De$cent in the Arch D B. But
the Moment acquired in <I>B,</I> along the Arch C <I>B,</I> is able to carry the
$ame Moveable upwards along the Arch <I>B</I> D: Therefore the Mo-
ment acquired in the De$cent D <I>B</I> is equall to that which driveth
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>142</p>
the $ame Moveable along the $ame Arch from <I>B</I> to D: So that ge-
nerally every Moment acquired along the De$cent of an Arch is
equall to that which hath power to make the $ame Moveable re-
a$cend along the $ame Arch: <I>B</I>ut all the Moments that make the
Moveable a$cend along all the Arches <I>B</I> D, <I>B</I> G, <I>B</I> I are equal,
$ince they are made by one and the $ame Moment acquired along
the De$cent C <I>B,</I> as Experience $hews: Therefore all the Moments
that are acquired by the De$cents along the Arches D <I>B,</I> G <I>B,</I> and
I <I>B</I> are equal.</P>
<P>SAGR. Your Di$cour$e is in my Judgment very Rational, and
the Experiment $o appo$ite and pertinent to verifie the <I>Po$tulatum,</I>
that it very well de$erveth to be admitted as if it were Demon-
$trated.</P>
<P>SALV. I will not con$ent, <I>Sagredus,</I> that we take more to our
$elves than we ought; and the rather for that we are chiefly to
make u$e of this A$$umption in Motions made upon $treight and
not curved Superficies; in which the Acceleration proceedeth with
degrees very different from tho$e wherewith we $uppo$e it to pro-
ceed in $treight Planes. In$omuch, that although the Experiment
alledged $hews us, that the de$cent along the Arch C <I>B</I> conferreth
on the Moveable $uch a Moment, as that it is able to re-carry it
to the $ame height along any other Arch <I>B</I> C, <I>B</I> G, and <I>B</I> I, yet
we cannot with the like evidence $hew, that the $ame would hap-
pen in ca$e a mo$t exact <I>B</I>all were to de$cend by $treight Planes in-
clined according to the inclinations of the Chords of the$e $ame
Arches: yea, it is credible, that Angles being formed by the $aid
Right Planes in the term <I>B,</I> the <I>B</I>all de$cended along the Declivi-
ty according to the Chord C <I>B,</I> finding a $top in the Planes a$cend-
ing according to the Chords <I>B</I> D, <I>B</I> G, and <I>B</I> I, in ju$tling again$t
them, would lo$e of its <I>Impetus,</I> and could not be able in ri$ing to
attain the height of the Line C D. <I>B</I>ut the Ob$tacle being remo-
ved, which prejudiceth the Experiment, I do believe, that the un-
der$tanding may conceive, that the <I>Impetus</I> (which in effect de-
riveth vigour from the quantity of the De$cent) would be able to
remount the Moveable to the $ame height. Let us therefore take
this at pre$ent for a <I>Po$tulatum</I> or Petition, the ab$olute truth of
which will come to be e$tabli$hed hereafter by $eeing other Con-
clu$ions rai$ed upon this Hypothe$is to an$wer, and exactly jump
with the Experiment. The Author having $uppo$ed this only Prin-
ciple, he pa$$eth to the Propo$itions, demon$tratively proving them;

<P>The time in which a Space is pa$$ed by a Movea-

<P><I>Let us by the exten$ion A B repre$ent the Time, in which the

G F <I>dividing</I> A E <I>into two equall parts in I: For
if the Parallels of the Triangle</I> A E <I>B be continued
out unto</I> I G F, <I>we $hall have the Aggregate of all
the Parallels contained in the Quadrilatural Figure
equal to the Aggregate of all the Parallels compre-

celeration or encrea$ing Velocity, and the Parallels contained in the Pa-
rallelogram do likewi$e repre$ent as many degrees of Equable Motion or
unencrea$ing Velocity: It appeareth, that as many Moments of Velocity
pa$$ed in the Accelerate Motion according to the encrea$ing Parallels of the
Triangle A E B, as in the Equable Motion according to the Parallels of
the Parallelogram G B: Becau$e what is wanting in the fir$t half of the</I>

<I>is made up by the moments repre$ented by the Parallels of the Triangle</I>

in the $ame Time by two Moveables, one whereof is moved with a Mo-
tion uniformly Accelerated from Re$t, the other with a Motion Equable
according to the Moment $ubduple of that of the greate$t Velocity of the

<P>If a <I>M</I>oveable de$cend out of Re$t with a <I>M</I>oti-

pa$$eth in any what$oever Times are to each

them.</P>
<P><I>Let</I> A B <I>repre$ent a length of Time beginning at the fir$t In$tant A;
and let</I> A D <I>and</I> A E <I>repre$ent any two parts of the $aid Time;
and let</I> H I <I>be a Line in which the Moveable out of H, (as the fir$t
beginning of the Motion) de$cendeth uniformly accelerating; and let the</I>
<fig>
<I>Space</I> H L <I>be pa$$ed in the fir$t Time</I> A D; <I>and let</I> H M
<I>be the Space that it $hall de$cend in the Time</I> A E. <I>I $ay,
the Space</I> M H <I>is to the Space</I> H L <I>in duplicate propor-
tion of that which the Time</I> E A <I>hath to the Time</I> A D<I>:
Or, if you will, that the Spaces</I> M H <I>and</I> H L <I>are to one
another in the $ame proportion as the Squares</I> E A <I>and</I>
A D. <I>Draw the Line</I> A C <I>at any Angle with</I> A B, <I>and

of Velocity acquired in the In$tant D of the Time</I> A D;
<I>and</I> P <I>the greate$t degree of Velocity acquired in the In-
$tant E of the Time</I> A E. <I>And becau$e we have de-
mon$trated in the la$t Propo$ition concerning Spaces, that
tho$e are equal to one another, of which two Moveables
have pa$t in the $ame Time, the one by a Moveable out
of Re$t with a Motion uniformly Accelerate, and the
other by the $ame Moveable with an Equable Motion,
who$e Velocity is $ubduple to the greate$t acquired by the
Accelerate Motion: Therefore</I> M H <I>and</I> H L <I>are the Spaces that two
Lquable Motions, who$e Velocities $hould be as the half of</I> P E, <I>and</I>
<foot><I>half</I></foot>
<p n=>145</p>
<I>half of</I> O D, <I>would pa$$e in the Times</I> E A <I>and</I> D A. <I>If it be proved
therefore that the$e Spaces</I> M H <I>and</I> L H <I>are in duplicate proportion to
the Times</I> E A <I>and</I> D A; <I>We $hall have done that which was intended.
But in the fourth Propo$ition of the Fir$t Book we have demon$trated:
That the Spaces pa$t by two Moveables with an Equable Motion are
to each other in a proportion compounded of the proportion of the Velo-
cities and of the proportion of the Times: But in this ca$e the propor-
tion of the Velocities and the proportion of the Times is the $ame</I> (<I>for
as the half of</I> P E <I>is to the half of</I> O D, <I>or the whole</I> P E <I>to the whole</I>
O D, <I>$o is</I> A E <I>to</I> A D<I>: Therefore the proportion of the Spaces pa$-
$ed is double to the proportion of the Times. Which was to be demon-
$trated.</I></P>
<P><I>Hence likewi$e it is manife$t, that the proportion of the $ame Spaces
is double to the proportions of the greate$t degrees of Velocity: that is,
of the Lines</I> P E <I>and</I> O D<I>: becau$e</I> P E <I>is to</I> O D, <I>as</I> E A <I>to</I> D A.</P>
<head>COROLARY I.</head>
<P><I>Hence it is manife$t, that if there were many equal Times taken in or-
der from the fir$t In$tant or beginniug of the Motion, as $uppo$e</I>
A D, D E, E F, F G, <I>in which the Spaces</I> H L, L M, M N, N I
<I>are pa$$ed, tho$e Spaces $hall be to one another as the odd numbers
from an Vnite:</I> $cilicet, <I>as 1, 3, 5, 7. For this is the Rate or pro-
portion of the exce$$es of the Squares of Lines that equally exceed
one another, and the exce$$e of which is equal to the least of them,
or, if you will, of Squares that follow one another, beginning</I> ab
Unitate. <I>Whil$t therefore the degree of Velocity is encrea$ed ac-
cording to the $imple Series of Numbers in equal Times, the Spaces
pa$t in tho$e Times make their encrea$e according to the Series of
odd Numbers from an Vnite.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Be plea$ed to $tay your Reading, whil$t I do paraphra$e
touching a certain Conjecture that came into my mind
but even now; for the explanation of which, unto your under-
$tanding and my own, I will de$cribe a $hort Scheme: in which I
fan$ie by the Line A I the continuation of the Time after the fir$t
In$tant, applying the Right Line A F unto A according to any
Angle: and joyning together the Terms I F, I divide the Time A I
in half at C, and then draw C B parallel to I F. <I>A</I>nd then con$ide-
ring B C, as the greate$t degree of Velocity which beginning from
Re$t in the fir$t In$tant of the Time <I>A</I> goeth augmenting accord-
ing to the encrea$e of the Parallels to B C, drawn in the Triangle
<I>A</I> B C, (which is all one as to encrea$e according to the encrea$e
of the Time) I admit without di$pute, upon what hath been $aid
already, That the Space pa$t by the falling Moveable with the
<foot>V Velocity</foot>
<p n=>146</p>
Velocity encrea$ed in the manner afore$aid would be equal to the
Space that the $aid Moveable would pa$$e, in ca$e it were in the
$ame Time <I>A</I> C, moved with an Uniform Motion, who$e degree of
Velocity $hould be equal to E C, the half of B C. I now proceed
farther, and imagine the Moveable; having de$cended with an
<I>A</I>ccelerate Motion, to have in the In$tant
C the degree of Velocity B C: It is ma-
<fig>
nife$t, that if it did continue to move
with the $ame degree of Velocity B C,
without farther <I>A</I>cceleration, it would
pa$$e in the following Time C I, a Space
double to that which it pa$$ed in the equal
Time <I>A</I> C, with the degree of Uniform
Velocity E C, the half of the Degree B C.
But becau$e the Moveable de$cendeth
with a Velocity encrea$ed alwaies Uni-
formly in all equal Times; it will add to
the degree C B in the following Time
C I, tho$e Tame Moments of Velocity
that encrea$e according to the Parallels of
the Triangle B F G, equal to the Triangle
<I>A</I> B C. So that adding to the degree of
Velocity G I, the half of the degree F G, the greate$t of tho$e ac-
quired in the <I>A</I>ccelerate Motion, and regulated by the Parallels of
the Triangle B F G, we $hall have the degree of Velocity I N, with
which, with an Uniform Motion, it would have moved in the
Time C I: Which degree I N, being triple the degree E C, pro-
veth that the Space pa$$ed in the $econd Time C I ought to be tri-
ple to that of the fir$t Time C <I>A. A</I>nd if we $hould $uppo$e to be
added to <I>A</I> I another equal part of Time I O, and the Triangle to
be enlarged unto <I>A</I> P O; it is manife$t, that if the Motion $hould
continue for all the Time I O with the degree of Velocity I F,
acquired in the <I>A</I>ccelerate Motion in the Time <I>A</I> I, that degree
I F being Quadruple to E C, the Space pa$$ed would be Quadruple
to that pa$$ed in the equal fir$t Time <I>A</I> C: But continuing the
encrea$e of the Uniform <I>A</I>cceleration in the Triangle F P Q like
to that of the Triangle <I>A</I> B C, which being reduced to equable
Motion addeth the degree equal to E C, Q R being added, equal
to E C, we $hall have the whole Equable Velocity exerci$ed in the
Time I O, quintuple to the Equable Velocity of the fir$t Time <I>A</I> C,
and therefore the Space pa$$ed quintuple to that pa$t in the fir$t
Time <I>A</I> C. We $ee therefore, even by this familiar computation,
That the Spaces pa$$ed in equal Times by a Moveable which
departing from Re$t goeth acquiring Velocity, according to the
encrea$e of the Time, are to one another as the odd Numbers <I>ab</I>
<foot><I>unitate</I></foot>
<p n=>147</p>
<I>unitate 1, 3, 5: A</I>nd that the Spaces pa$$ed being conjunctly taken,
that pa$$ed in the double Time is quadruple to that pa$$ed in the
$ubduple, that pa$$ed in the triple Time is nonuple; and, in a word,
that the Spaces pa$$ed are in duplicate proportion to their Times;
that is, as the Squares of the $aid Times.</P>
<P>SIMP. I mu$t confe$$e that I have taken more plea$ure in this
plain and clear di$cour$e of <I>Sagredus,</I> than in the to-me-more
ob$cure Demon$tration of the <I>A</I>uthor: $o that I am very well
$atisfied, that the bu$ine$$e is to $ucceed as hath been $aid, the
Definition of Uniformly <I>A</I>ccelerate Motion being $uppo$ed, and
granted. But whether this be the <I>A</I>cceleration of which Nature
maketh u$e in the Motion of its de$cending Grave Bodies, I yet
make a que$tion: and therefore for information of me, and of
others like unto me, me thinks it would be $ea$onable in this place
to produce $ome Experiment among$t tho$e which were $aid to be
many, which in $undry Ca$es agree with the Conclu$ions demon-
$trated.</P>
<P>SALV. You, like a true <I>A</I>rti$t, make a very rea$onable demand,
and $o it is u$ual and convenient to do in Sciences that apply
Mathematical Demon$trations to Phy$ical Conclu$ions, as we $ee
in the Profe$$ors of Per$pection, <I>A</I>$tronomy, Mechanicks, Mu$ick,
and others, who with Sen$ible Experiments confirm tho$e their
Principles that are as the foundations of all the following Structure:
and therefore I de$ire that it may not be thought $uperfluous, that
we di$cour$e with $ome prolixity upon this fir$t and grand funda-
mental on which we lay the weight of the Immen$e Machine of
infinite Conclu$ions, of which we have but a very $mall part $et
down in this Book by our <I>A</I>uthor, who hath done enough to open
the way and door that hath been hitherto $hut unto all Specula-
tive Wits. Touching Experiments, therefore, the <I>A</I>uthor hath
not omitted to make $everal; and to a$$ure us, that the <I>A</I>ccelerati-
on of natural-de$cending Graves hapneth in the afore$aid propor-
tion, I have many times in his company $et my $elf to make a triall
thereof in the following Method.</P>
<P>In a pri$me or Piece of Wood, about twelve yards long, and
half a yard broad one way, and three Inches the other, we made,
upon the narrow Side or edge a Groove of little more than an Inch
wide; we $hot it with the Grooving Plane very $traight, and to
make it very $mooth and $leek, we glued upon it a piece of Vellum,
poli$hed and $moothed as exactly as can be po$$ible: and in it we
have let a brazen Ball, very hard, round, and $mooth, de$cend.
Having placed the $aid Pri$me Pendent, rai$ing one of its ends
above the Horizontal Plane a yard or two at plea$ure, we have let
the Ball (as I $aid) de$cend along the Grove, ob$erving, in the
manner that I $hall tell you pre$ently, the Time which it $pent in
<foot>V 2 running</foot>
<p n=>148</p>
runing it all; repeating the $ame ob$ervation again and again to
a$$ure our $elves of the Time, in which we never found any diffe-
rence, no not $o much as the tenth part of one beat of the Pul$e.
Having done, and preci$ely ordered this bu$ine$$e, we made the
$ame Ball to de$cend only the fourth part of the length of that
Grove: and having mea$ured the time of its de$cent, we alwaies
found it to be punctually half the other. And then making trial of
other parts, examining one while the Time of the whole Length
with the Time of half the Length, or with that of 2/3, or of 3/4, or, in
brief, with any whatever other Divi$ion, by Experiments repeated
near an hundred Times, we alwaies found the Spaces to be to one
another as the Squares of the Times. And this in all Inclinations
of the Plane, that is, of the Grove in which the Ball was made to
de$cend. In which we ob$erved moreover, that the Times of the
De$cents along $undry Inclinations did retain the $ame proportion
to one another, exactly, which anon you will $ee a$$igned to them,
and demon$trated by the Author. And as to the mea$uring of the
Time; we had a good big Bucket full of Water hanged on high,
which by a very $mall hole, pierced in the bottom, $pirted, or, as
we $ay, $pin'd forth a $mall thread of Water, which we received
with a $mall cup all the while that the Ball was de$cending in the
Grove, and in its parts; and then weighing from time to time the
$mall parcels of Water, in that manner gathered, in an exact pair
of $cales, the differences and proportions of their Weights gave
ju$tly the differences and proportions of the Times; and this with
$uch exactne$$e, that, as I $aid before, the trials being many
and many times repeated, they never differed any con$iderable
matter.</P>
<P>SIMP. I $hould have received great $atisfaction by being pre$ent
at tho$e Experiments: but being confident of your diligence in
making them, and veracity in relating them, I content my $elf, and
admit them for true and certain.</P>
<P>SALV. We may, then, rea$$ume our Reading, and go on.</P>
<head>COROLLARY II.</head>
<P>It is collected in the $econd place, that if any two Spaces are ta-
ken from the beginning of the Motion, pa$$ed in any Times,
tho$e Times $hall be unto each other as one of them is to a
Space that is the Mean proportional between them.</P>
<P><I>For taking two Spaces S T, and S V from the beginning of the Mo-
tion S, to which S X is a Mean-proportional, the Time of the de$cent
along S T, $hall be to the Time of the de$cent along S V, as S T to S X;
or, if you will, the Time along S V $hall be to the Time along S T,</I>
<foot><I>as</I></foot>
<p n=>149</p>
<fig>
<I>as VS is to SX. For it is demon$trated, that Spaces
pa$$ed are in duplicate proportion to the Times, or, (which
is the $ame) are as the Squares of the Times: But the pro-
portion of the Space VS to the Space ST is double to the
proportion of V S to SX, or is the $ame that V S, and S X
$quared have to one another: Therefore, the proportion of
the Times of the Motion by V S, and ST, is as the Spaces or
Lines V S to S X.</I></P>
<head>SCHOLIUM.</head>
<P><I>That which is demon$trated in Motions that are made Perpendicu-
larly, may be under$tood al$o to hold true in the Motions made along
Planes of any whatever Inclination; for it is $uppo$ed, that in them
the degree of Acceleration encrea$eth in the $ame proportion; that
is, according to the encrea$e of the Time; or, if you will, according
to the $imple and primary Series of Numbers.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Here I de$ire <I>Sagredus,</I> that I al$o may be allowed, al-

Conclu$ions heretofore learnt of our <I>Academick,</I> I now remember

<P>SAGR. If our advantage $hall be $uch as you promi$eus, there

about the confirmation and thorow e$tabli$hing the$e Sciences of
Motion: and as to my own particular, I not only grant you liber-
ty to $atisfie your $elf in this particular, but moreover entreat you
to gratifie, as $oon as you can, the Curio$ity which you have begot
in me touching the $ame: and I believe that <I>Simplicius</I> al$o is of the
$ame mind.</P>
<P>SIMP. I cannot deny what you $ay.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. Seeing then that I have your permi$$ion, I will in the
fir$t place con$ider, as an Effect well known, That</P>
<foot>PROP.</foot>
<p n=>150</p>
<head>LEMMA.</head>
<P><I>That the Moments or Velocities of the $ame Moveable are different
upon different Inclinations of Planes, and the greate$t is by the
Line elevated perpendicularly above the Horizon, and by the
others inclined, the $aid Velocity dimini$heth according as they
more and more depart from Perpendicularity, that is, as they in-
cline more obliquely: $o that the Impetus, Talent, Energy, or, we
may $ay, Moment of de$cending is dimini$hed in the Moveable by
the $ubjected Plane, upon which the $aid Moveable lyeth and
de$cendeth.</I></P>
<P>And the better to expre$s my $elf, let the Line A B be perpen-
dicularly erected upon the Horizon A C: then $uppo$e the
$ame to be declined in $undry Inclinations towards the Horizon, as
in A D, A E, A F, <I>&amp;c.</I> I $ay, that the greate$t and total <I>Impetus</I>
of the Grave Body in de$cending is along the Perpendicular B A,
and le$s than that along D A,
<fig>
and yet le$s along E A; and
$ucce$$ively dimini$hing along
the more inclined F <I>A,</I> and fi-
nally is wholly extinct in the
Horizontal C <I>A,</I> where the
Moveable is indifferent either
to Motion or Re$t, and hath not
of it $elf any Inclination to
move one way or other, nor yet
any Re$i$tance to its being mo-
ved: for as it is impo$$i-
ble that a Grave Body, or a
Compound thereof $hould move naturally upwards, receding from
the Common Center, towards which all Grave Matters con$pire
to go, $o it is impo$$ible that it do $pontaneou$ly move, unle$s
with that Motion its particular Center of Gravity do acquire Proxi-
mity to the $aid Common Center: $o that upon the Horizontal
which here is under$tood to be a Superficies equidi$tant from the
$aid Center, and therefore altogether void of Inclination, the <I>Im-
petus</I> or Moment of that $ame Moveable $hall be nothing at all.
Having under$tood this mutation of <I>Impetus,</I> I am to explain that
which, in an old Treati$e of the Mechanicks, written heretofore
in <I>Padona</I> by our <I>Academick,</I> only for the u$e of his Scholars, was
diffu$ely and demon$tratively proved, upon the occa$ion of con-
$idering the Original and Nature of the admirable In$trument cal-
led the Screw, and it is, With what proportion that mutation of
<foot><I>Impetus,</I></foot>
<p n=>151</p>
<I>Impetus</I> is made along $everal Inclinations or Declivities of
Planes.</P>
<P>As, for example, in the inclined Plane A F, drawing its Eleva-
tion above the Horizontal, that is, the Line F C, along the which
the <I>Impetus</I> of a Grave Body, and the Moment of De$cent is the
greate$t; it is $ought what proportion this Moment hath to the
Moment of the $ame Moveable along the Declivity F A: Which
Proportion, I $ay, is Reciprocal to the $aid Lengths. And this is
the <I>Lemma</I> that was to go before the Theorem, which I hope to be
able anon to Demon$trate. Hence it is manife$t, That the <I>Impetus</I>
of De$cent of a Grave Body is as much as the Re$i$tance or lea$t
force that $ufficeth to arre$t and $tay it. For this Force or Re$i-
$tance, and its mea$ure, I will make u$e of the Gravity of another
Moveable. Let us now upon the Plane F A put the Moveable G
tyed to a thread which $liding over F hath fa$tned at its other end
the Weight H: and let us con$ider that the Space of the De$cent
or A$cent of the Weight H along the Perpendicular, is alwaies
equal to the whole A$cent or De$cent of the other Moveable G
along the ^{*} Declivity A F, but yet not to the A$cent or De$cent
<marg>* Or inclined
Plane.</marg>
along the Perpendicular, in which only the $aid Moveable G (like
as every other Moveable) exerci$eth its Re$i$tance. Which is
manife$t: for con$idering in the Triangle AFC the Motion of
the Moveable G, as for example, upwards from A to F, to be com-
po$ed of the tran$ver$e Horizontal Line A C, and of the Perpendi-
cular C F: <I>A</I>nd in regard, that as to the Horizontal Plane along
which the Moveable, as hath been $aid, hath no Re$i$tance to mo-
ving (it not making by that Motion any lo$s, nor yet acqui$t in
regard of its particular di$tance from the Common Center of Grave
Matters, which in the Horizon continueth $till the $ame) it remai-
neth that the Re$i$tance be only in re$pect of the <I>A</I>$cent that it is to
make along the Perpendicular C F. Whil$t therefore the Grave
Moveable G, moving from <I>A</I> to F, hath only the Perpendicular
Space C F to re$i$t in its <I>A</I>$cent, and whil$t the other Grave Move-
able H de$cendeth along the Perpendicular of nece$$ity as far as
the whole Space F <I>A,</I> and that the $aid proportion of <I>A</I>$cent and
De$cent maintains it $elf alwaies the $ame, be the Motion of the
$aid Moveables little or much (by rea$on they are tyed toge-
ther) we may confidently affirm, that in ca$e there were an <I>Equi-
librium,</I> that is Re$t, to en$ue betwixt the $aid Moveables, the Mo-
ments, the Velocities, or their Propen$ions to Motion, that is the
Spaces which they would pa$s in the $ame Time $hould an$wer re-
ciprocally to their Gravities, according to that which is demon$tra-
ted in all ca$es of Mechanick Motions: $o that it $hall $uffice to
impede the de$cent of G, if H be but $o much le$s grave than it, as
in proportion the Space C F is le$$er than the Space F <I>A.</I> Therefore
<foot>$uppo$e</foot>
<p n=>152</p>
$uppo$e that the Moveable G is to the Moveable H, as F <I>A</I> is to
F C; and then the <I>Equilibrium</I> $hall follow, that is, the Moveables
H and G $hall have equal Moments, and the Motion of the $aid
Moveables $hall cea$e. <I>A</I>nd becau$e we $ee that the <I>Impetus,</I>
Energy, Moment, or Propen$ion of a Moveable to Motion is the
$ame as is the Force or $malle$t Re$i$tance that $ufficeth to $top it;
and becau$e it hath been concluded, that the Grave Body H is $uf.
ficient to arre$t the Motion of
<fig>
the Grave Body G: Therefore
the le$$er Weight H, which in
the Perpendicular F C imploy-
eth its total Moment, $hall be
the preci$e mea$ure of the par-
tial Moment that the greater
Weight G exerci$eth along the
inclined Plane F <I>A</I>: But the
mea$ure of the total Moment of
the $aid Grave Body G, is the
$elf $ame, ($ince that to impede
the Perpendicular De$cent of a
Grave Body there is required the oppo$ition of $uch another Grave
Body, which likewi$e is at liberty to move Perpendicularly:)
Therefore the partial <I>Impetus</I> or Moment of G along the inclined
Plane F A $hall be to the grand and total <I>Impetus</I> of the $ame G
along the Perpendicular F C, as the Weight H to the Weight G:
that is, by Con$truction, as the $aid Perpendicular F C, the Eleva-
tion of the inclined Plane, is to the $ame inclined Plane F A:
Which is that that by the <I>Lemma</I> was propo$ed to be demon-
$trated, and which by our Author, as we $hall $ee, is $uppo$ed as
known in the $econd part of the Sixth Propo$ition of the pre$ent
Treati$e.</P>
<P>SAGR. From this that you have already concluded I conceive
one may ea$ily deduce, arguing <I>ex &aelig;quali</I> by perturbed Proportion,
that the Moments of the $ame Moveable, along Planes variou$ly
inclined (as F A and F I) that have the $ame Elevation, are to each
other in Reciprocal proportion to the $ame Planes.</P>
<P>SALV. <I>A</I> mo$t certain Conclu$ion. This being agreed on, we
will pa$s in the next place to demon$trate the <I>Theoreme,</I> namely,
that</P>
<foot>THEOR.</foot>
<p n=>153</p>
<head>THEOREM.</head>
<P><I>The degrees of Velocity of a Moveable de$cending with a Natural
Motion from the $ame height along Planes in any manner inclined
at the arrival to the Horizon are alwaies equal, Impediments be-
ing removed.</I></P>
<P>Here we are in the fir$t place to adverti$e you, that it having
been proved, that in any Inclination of the Plane the Move-
able from its rece$$ion from Quie$$ence goeth encrea$ing its Ve-
locity, or quantity of its <I>Impetus,</I> with the proportion of the
Time (according to the Definition which the Author giveth of
Motion naturally Accelerate) whereupon, as he hath by the pre-
cedent Propo$ition demon$trated, the Spaces pa$$ed are in dupli-
cate proportion to the Times, and, con$equently, to the degrees
of Velocity: look what the <I>Impetus's</I> were in that which was fir$t
moved, $uch proportionally $hall be the degrees of Velocity gai-
ned in the $ame Time; $eeing that both the$e and tho$e encrea$e
with the $ame proportion in the $ame Time.</P>
<P>Now let the inclined Plane be A B, its elevation above the Ho
rizon the Perpendicular A C, and the Horizontal Plane C B: and
becau$e, as was even now concluded, the <I>Impetus</I> of a Moveable
along the Perpendicular A C is to the <I>Impetus</I> of the $ame along
the inclined Plane A B, as A B is to A C, let there be taken in the
inclined Plane A B, A D a third proportional to A B and A C:
The <I>Impetus,</I> therefore, along A C is to the <I>Impetus</I> along A B,
that is along A D, as A C is to
<fig>
A D: And therefore the Move-
able in the $ame Time that it
would pa$s the Perpendicular
Space AC, $hall likewi$e pa$s the
Space A D, in the inclined Plane
A B, (the Moments being as
the Spaces:) And the degree of Velocity in C $hall have the $ame
proportion to the degree of Velocity in D, as A C hath to A D:
But the degree of Velocity in B is to the $ame degree in D, as the
Time along A B is to the Time along AD, by the definition of
Accelerate Motion; And the Time along AB is to the Time along
A D, as the $ame A C, the Mean Proportional between B A and
A D, is to A D, by the la$t Corollary of the $econd Propo$ition:
Therefore the degrees of Velocity in B and in C have to the de-
gree in D, the $ame Proportion as A C hath to A D; and therefore
are equal: Which is the <I>Theorem</I> intended to be demon$trated.</P>
<P>By this we may more concludingly prove the en$uing third
<foot>X Propo$i-</foot>
<p n=>154</p>
Propo$ition of the Author, in which he makes u$e of this Princi-
ple; and it is, That the Time along the inclined Plane, hath to the
Time along the Perpendicular, the $ame proportion as the $aid In-
clined Plane and Perpendicular. For if we put the ca$e that BA
be the Time along A B, the Time along A D $hall be the Mean
between them, that is A C, by the $econd Corollary of the $econd
Propo$ition: But if C A be the Time along A D, it $hall likewi$e
be the Time along <I>A</I> C, by rea$on that <I>A</I> D and <I>A</I> C are pa$t in
equal Times: And therefore in ca$e B <I>A</I> be the Time along A B,
<I>A</I> C $hall be the Time along <I>A</I> C: Therefore, as <I>A</I> B is to A C, $o
is the Time along <I>A</I> B to the Time along <I>A</I> C.</P>
<P>By the $ame di$cour$e one $hall prove, that the Time along <I>A</I> C
is to the Time along the inclined Plane <I>A</I> E, as <I>A</I> C is to <I>A</I> E:
Therefore, <I>ex &aelig;quali,</I> the Time along the inclined Plane <I>A B</I> is,
Directly, to the Time along the inclined Plane <I>A</I> E as <I>A B</I> to
<I>A E, &amp;c.</I></P>
<P>One might al$o by the $ame application of the <I>Theorem,</I> as <I>Sa-
gredus</I> $hall very evidently $ee anon, immediately demon$trate the
$ixth Propo$ition of the <I>A</I>uthor: <I>B</I>ut let this Digre$$ion $uffice
for the pre$ent, which he perhaps thinketh too tedious, though in-
deed it is of $ome importance in the$e matters of Motion.</P>

<P>If a Moveable departing from Re$t do move along
an Inclined Plane, and al$o along the Perpendi-
cular who$e heights are the $ame, the Times of
their Motions $hall be to one another as the
Lengths of the $aid Plane and Perpendicular.</P>
<P><I>Let the inclined Plane be A C, and the Perpendicular A B,
who$e heights are the $ame above the Horizon C B, to wit,
the $elf $ame Line B A. I $ay, that the Time of the De$cent
of the $ame Moveable upon the Plane A C, hath the $ame Proporti-
on to the Time of the De$cent along the Perpendicular A B, as the
Length of the Plane A C hath to the Length of the $aid Perpendi-
cular. For let any number of Lines D G, E I, F L, be drawn, Paral-
lel to the Horizon C B: It is manife$t from the A$$umption fore-
going, that the degrees of Velocity of the Moveable, departing from
A the beginning of Motion, acquired in the Points G and D are</I>
<foot><I>equal,</I></foot>
<p n=>155</p>
<I>equal, their exce$$e or elevation above the Horizon being equal;
and $o the degrees in the Points I and E; as al$o the degrees in L
and F. And if not only the$e Parallels, but many more were $up-
po$ed to be drawn from all the points imagined to be in the Line
A B, untill they meet the Line A C, the Mo-</I>
<fig>
<I>ments, or degrees of the Velocities along the
extreams [or ends] of every one of tho$e
Parallels, $hall be alwaies equal to one ano-
ther: Therefore the two Spaces A C and A B
are pa$t with the $ame degree of Velocity:
But it hath been demon$trated, that if two
Spaces be pa$$ed by a Moveable with one
and the $ame degree of Velocity, the Times
of the Motions have the $ame proportion as
tho$e Spaces: Therefore the Time of the Motion along A C is to the
Time along A B, as the Length of the Plane A C to the length of the
Perdendicular A B. Which was to be demon$trated.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. It $eemeth to me, that the $ame might very clearly and
conci$ely be concluded, it having fir$t been proved that the $um of
the Accelerate Motion of the Tran$itions along A C and A B, is
as much as the Equable Motion, who$e degree of Velocity is $ub-
duple to the greate$t degree C B: Therefore the two Spaces AC
and A B being pa$$ed with the $ame Equable Motion, it hath been
$hewn, by the Fir$t Propo$ition of the fir$t, that the Times of the
Tran$itions $hall be as the $aid Spaces.</P>
<head>COROLLARY.</head>
<P>Hence is collected, that the Times of the De$cents along Planes
of different Inclination, but of the $ame Elevation, are to
one another according to their Lengths.</P>
<P><I>For if we $uppo$e another Plane A M, coming from A, and ter-
minated by the $ame Horizontal C B; it $hall in like manner be
demon$trated, that the Time of the De$cent along A M, is to the
Time along A B, as the Line A M to A B: But as the Time A B is
to the Time along A C, $o is the Line A B to A C: Therefore,</I> ex

<P><I>Let there proceed from the term B two equal Planes, but une-

<I>that the proportion of D B to B I, is $ub-

I $ay, that the proportion of the Times

becau$e it hath been demon$trated that the Time of the De$cent

<P><I>Let A B and A C be Planes inclined after different manners,

the proportion of the Time of the De$cent along A C to the

a Parallel be drawn to the Horizon inter$ecting</I>

which is the $ubduple proportion of the Elevati-

is the $ame as that of L A to A D, or of G A to A L; which is $ub-

<P>If from the highe$t or lowe$t part of a Circle,

<P><I>Let the Circle be erect upon the Horizon G H, who$e Diameter
recited upon the lowe$t point, that is upon the contact with the

Planes A B and A C incline towards the Circumference: I $ay that the
Times of the De$cents along the $ame are equal. Let B D and C E be
two Perpendiculars let fall unto the Diameter; and let A I be a Mean-
Proportional between the Altitudes</I>
<fig>
<I>of the Planes E A and A D. And
becau$e the Rectangles F A E and
F A D are equal to the Squares of
A C and A B; And al$o becau$e
that as the Rectangle F A E, is to
the Rectangle F A D, $o is E A to
A D. Therefore as the Square of
C A is to the Square of B A,
$o is the Line E A to the Line
A D. But as the Line E A is to
D A, $o is the Square of I A to the Square of A D: Therefore
the Squares of the Lines C A and A B are to each other as the Squares
of the Lines I A and A D: And therefore as the Line C A is to A B,
$o is I A to A D: But in the precedent Propo$ition it hath been demon-
$trated that the proportion of the Time of the De$cent along A C to the
Time of the De$cent by A B, is compounded of the proportions of C A
to A B, and of D A to A I, which is the $ame with the proportion of
B A to A C: Therefore the proportion of the Time of the De$cent along
A C, to the Time of the De$cent along A B, is compounded of the pro-
portions of C A to A B, and of B A to A C: Therefore the proporti-
on of tho$e Times is a proportion of equality: Therefore the Propo$ition
is evident.</I></P>
<P><I>The $ame is another way demon$trated from the Mechanicks: Name-
ly that in the en$uing Figure the Moveable pa$$eth in equal Times along
C A and D A. For let B A be equal to the $aid D A, ond let fall the
Perpendiculars B E and D F: It is manife$t by the Elements of the</I>
<foot><I>Mechanicks:</I></foot>
<p n=>159</p>
<I>Mechanicks: That the Moment of the Weight elevated upon the Plane
according to the Line A B C, is
to its total Moment, as B E to B A;</I>
<fig>
<I>And that the Moment of the $ame
Weight upon the Elevation A D,
is to its total Moment, as D F to
D A or B A: Therefore the Mo-
ment of the $aid Weight upon the

is to the Moment upon the Plane
inclined according to A B C, as
the Line D F to the Line B E:
Therefore the Spaces which the
$aid Weight $hall pa$$e in equal
Times along the Inclined Planes C A and D A, $hall be to each other as
the Line B E to D F; by the $econd Propo$ition of the Fir$t Book:
But as B E is to D F, $o A C is demon$trated to be to D A:
Therefore the $ame Moveable will in equal Times pa$$e the Lines
C A and D A.</I></P>
<P><I>And that C A is to D A as B E is to D F, is thus demon$trated.</I></P>
<P><I>Draw a Line from C to D; and by D and B draw the Lines
D G L, (cutting C A in the point I) and B H, Parallels to A F:
And the Angle A D I $hall be equal to the Angle D C A, for that
the parts L A and A D of the Circumference $ubtending them, are
equal, and the Angle D A C common to them both: Therefore of
the equiangled Triangles C A D and D A I, the $ides about the
equal Angles $hall be proportional: And as C A is to A D, $o is
D A to A I, that is B A to A I, or H A to A G; that is, B E to
D F: Which was to be proved.</I></P>
<P><I>Or el$e the $ame $hall be demon$trated more $peedily thus.</I></P>
<P><I>Vnto the Horizon A B, let a Circle be erect, who$e Diameter is
perpendicular to the Horizon: and
from the highe$t Term D let a Plane</I>
<fig>
<I>at plea$ure D F, be inclined to the
Circumference. I $ay that the De-
$cent along the Plane D F, and the
Fall along the Diameter B C, will
be pa$$ed by the $ame Moveable in
equal Times. For let F G be drawn
parallel to the Horizon A B, which
$hall be perpendicular to the Diameter
D C, and let a Line conjoyn F and
C: and becau$e the Time of the Fall
along D C, is to the Time of the Fall along D G, as the Mean
Proportional between C D and D G, is to the $aid D G; and the</I>
<foot><I>Mean</I></foot>
<p n=>160</p>
<I>Mean between C D and D G being D F, (for that the Angle D F C
in the Semicircle, is a Right Angle, and F G perpendicular to D C:)
Therefore the Time of the Fall along D C is to the Time of the Fall
along D G, as the Line F D to D G: But it hath been demon$trated
that the Time of the De$cent along D F, is to the Time of the Fall
along D G, as the $ame Line D F is to D G: The Times, therefore,

<P>SAGR. Pray you Sir be plea$ed to $tay your Reading of what
followeth until that I have $atisfied my $elf in a Contemplation
that ju$t now cometh into my mind, which if it be not a delu$i-
on, is not far from being a plea$ing diverti$ement: as are all $uch
that proceed from Nature or nece$$ity.</P>
<P>It is manife$t, that if from a point a$$igned in an Horizontal
Plane, one $hall produce along the $ame Plane infinite right Lines
every way, upon each of which a point is under$tood to move with
an Equable Motion, all beginning to move in the $ame in$tant
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>161</p>
of Time from the a$$igned point, and the Velocities of them all
being equal, there $hall con$equently be de$cribed by tho$e move-
able points Circumferences of Circles alwayes bigger and bigger,
all concentrick about the fir$t point a$$igned: ju$t in the $ame
manner as we $ee it done in the Undulations of $tanding Water,
when a $tone is dropt into it; the percu$$ion of which $erveth to
give the beginning to the Motion on every $ide, and remaineth
as the Center of all the Circles that happen to be de$igned $ucce$-
$ively bigger and bigger by the $aid Undulations. But if we ima-
gine a Plane erect unto the Horizon, and a point be noted in the
$ame on high, from which infinite Lines are drawn inclined, ac-
cording to all inclinations, along which we fancy grave Movea-
bles to de$cend, each with a Motion naturally Accelerate
with tho$e Velocities that agree with the $everal Inclinations;
$uppo$ing that tho$e de$cending Moveables were continually vi$i-
ble, in what kind of Lines $hould we $ee them continually di$po$ed?
Hence my wonder ari$eth, $ince that the precedent Demon$trati-
ons a$$ure me, that they $hall all be alwayes $een in one and the
$ame Circumference of Circles $ucce$$ively encrea$ing, according
as the Moveables in de$cending go more and more $ucce$$ively re-
ceding from the highe$t point in which their Fall began: And the
better to declare my $elf, let the chiefe$t point A be marked, from
which Lines de$cend according to any Inclinations A F, A H, and
the Perpendicular A B, in which taking the points C and D, de-
$cribe Circles about them that pa$s by
<fig>
the point A, inter$ecting the inclined
Lines in the points F, H, B, and E, G,
I. It is manife$t, by the fore-going
Demon$trations, that Moveables de-
$cendent along tho$e Lines departing
at the $ame Time from the term A,
one $hall be in E, the other $hall be in
G, and the other in I; and $o con-
tinuing to de$cend they $hall arrive
in the $ame moment of Time at F, H,
and B: and the$e and infinite others continuing to move along the
infinite differing Inclinations, they $hall alwayes $ucce$$ively arrive
at the $elf-$ame Circumferences made bigger &amp; bigger <I>in infinitum.</I>
From the two Species, therefore, of Motion of which Nature makes
u$e, ari$eth, with admirable harmonious variety, the generation of in-
$inite Circles. She placeth the one as in her Seat, and original be-
ginning, in the Center of infinite concentrick Circles; the other
is con$tituted in the $ublime or highe$t Contact of infinite Circum-
ferences of Circles, all excentrick to one another: Tho$e proceed
from Motions all equal and Equable; The$e from Motions all al-
<foot>Y wayes</foot>
<p n=>162</p>
wayes Inequable to them$elves, and all unequal to one another,
that de$cend along the infinite different Inclinations. But we fur-
ther adde, that if from the two points a$$igned for the Emanations,
we $hall $uppo$e Lines to proceed, not onely along two Superfi-
cies Horizontal and Upright [or erect] but along all every ways
like as from tho$e, beginning at one $ole point, we pa$$ed to the
production of Circles from the lea$t to the greate$t, $o beginning
from one $ole point we $hall $ucce$$ively produce in$inite Spheres,
or we may $ay one Sphere, that $hall <I>gradatim</I> increa$e to infinite
bigne$$es: And this in two fa$hions; that is, either with placing
the original in the Center, or el$e in the Circumference of tho$e
Spheres.</P>
<P>SALV. The Contemplation is really ingenuous, and adequate
to the Wit of <I>Sagredus.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. Though I am at lea$t capable of the Speculation, ac-
cording to the two manners of the production of Circles and
Spheres, with the two different Natural Motions, howbeit I do
not perfectly under$tand the production depending on the Acce-
lerate Motion and its Demon$tration, yet notwith$tanding that
licence of a$$igning for the place of that Emanation as well the
lowe$t Center, as the highe$t Spherical Superficies, maketh me to
think that its po$$ible that $ome great Mi$tery may be contained

<P>If two Planes be inclined at plea$ure from a point

$ected by a Line which may make Angles Al-
ternately equal to the Angles contained be-
tween the $aid Planes and Horizontal Parallel,
the Motion along the parts cut off by the $aid

<P><I>From off the point C of the Horizontal Line X, let any two Planes
be inclined at plea$ure C D and C E, and in any point of the

and let the Line D F cut the Plane C E in F, in $uch a manner that
the Angles C D F and C F D may be equal to the Angles X C E, L C D
Alternately taken. I $ay, that</I>
<fig>
<I>the Times of the De$cents along

that (the Angle C D F being
$uppo$ed equal to the Angle

equal to the Angle D C L, is
manife$t. For the Common An-
gle D C F being taken from the
three Angles of the Triangle
C D F equal to two Right An-
gles, to which are equal all the Angles made with to the Line L X
at the point C, there remains in the Triangle two Angles C D F and
C F D, equal to the two Angles X C E and L C D: But it was $up-
po$ed that C D F is equal to the Angle X C E: Therefore the remaining
Angle C F D is equal to the remaining angle D C L. Let the Plane
C E be $uppo$ed equal to the Plane C D, and from the points D and
E rai$e the Perpendiculars D A and E B, unto the Horizontal Paral-
lel X L; and from C unto D F let fall the Perpendicular C G. And
becau$e the Angle C D G is equal to the Angle E C B; and becau$e
D G C and C B E are Right Angles; The Triangles C D G and
C B E $hall be equiangled: And as D C is to C G, $o let C E be
to E B: But D C is equal to C E: Therefore C G $hall be equal to
E B. And inregard that of the Triangles D A C and C G F, the An-
gles C and A are equal to the Angles F and G: Therefore as C D is to
D A, $o $hall F C be to C G; and Alternately, as D C is to C F, $o</I>
<foot><I>is</I></foot>
<p n=>165</p>
<I>is D A to C G, or B E. The proportion therefore of the Elevations
of the Planes equal to C D and C E, is the $ame with the proportion

<P><I>Take the $ame another way: Draw F S perpendicular to the

to C D. And becau$e the Triangle C F G is like to the Triangle
D C A, it $hall be, that as F C is to C G, $o is C D to D A:
Therefore,</I> ex &aelig;quali, <I>as

Again, the Triangle A C D
being like to the Triangle

D A is to D C, $o is G C

as D A is to G C, $o is D C to C F; and as the Square of D A
is to the Square of C G, $o is the Square of D C to the Square of

Square C G as the Line D A is to the Line F S: Therefore, as the
Square D C is to the Square C F, $o is the Line D E to F S: There-
fore, by the $eventh fore-going, in regard that the Elevations D A

Moveable coming out of any $ublimer Height
$hall $ooner pa$$e the $aid part of the inclined
<I>P</I>lane, than that part of the Perpendicular.</P>
<P><I>Let the Perpendicular be E B, and the Inclined Plane C E, joyned
at the $ame Point E, the Times of who$e Motions from off Re$t in
E are equal, and in the Perpendicular continued out, let a $ublime
point A be taken at plea$ure, out of which the Moveables may be let
fall. I $ay, that the Inclined Plane E C $hall be pa$$ed in a le$$e Time
than the Perpendicular E B, after the Fall A E. Draw a Line from C
to B, and having drawn the Horizontal Line A D continue out C E till
it meet the $ame in D; and let D F be a Mean-Proportional between
C D and D E; and let A G be a</I>
<fig>
<I>Mean-Proportional between B A and
A E; and draw F G and D G. And
becau$e the Time of the Motion along
E C and E B out of Re$t in E are
equal, the Angle C $hall be a Right
Angle, by the $econd Corollary of the
Sixth Propo$ition; and A is a Right
Angle, and the Vertical Angles
at E are equal: Therefore the Tri-
angles A E D and C E B are equian-
gled, and the Sides about equal An-
gles are Proportionals: Therefore as
B E is to E C, $o is D E to E A.
Therefore the Rectangle B E A is
equal to the Rectangle C E D: And
becau$e the Rectangle C D E ex-
ceedeth the Rectangle C E D, by the Square E D, and the Rectangle
B A E doth exceed the Rectangle B E A, by the Square E A: The
exce$$e of the Rectangle C D E above the Rectangle B A E, that is of
the Square F D above the Square A G $hall be the $ame as the exce$$e
of the Square D E above the Square A E; which exce$s is the
Square D A: Therefore the Square F D is equal to the two Squares
G A and A D, to which the Square G D is al$o equal: Therefore the</I>
<foot>Z 2 <I>Line</I></foot>
<p n=>172</p>
<I>Line D F is equal to D G, and the Angle D G F is equal to the An-
gle D F G, and the Angle E G F is le$$c than the Angle E F G, and
the oppo$ite Side E F le$$e than the Side E G. Now if we $uppo$e
the Time of the Fall along A E to be as A E, the Time by D E $hall
be as D E; and A G being a Mean-Proportional between B A and A E,
A G $hall be the Time along the whole A B, and the part E G $hall be
the Time along the Part E B</I> ex quiete <I>in A. And it may in like man-
ner be proved that E F is the Time along E C after the De$cent D E, or
after the Fall A E: But E F is proved to be le$$er than E G: Therefore
the Propo$ition is proved.</I></P>
<head>COROLLARY.</head>
<P>By this and the precedent it appears, that the Space that is pa$-
$ed along the Perpendicular after the Fall from above in the
$ame Time in which the Inclined Plane is pa$t, is le$$e than
that which is pa$t in the $ame Time as in the Inclined, no fall

Plane.</P>
<P><I>For it having been proved, but now, that of the Moveables coming
from the $ublime Term A the Time of the Conver$ion along E C is
$horter than the Time of the Progre$$ion along E B; It is manife$t that
the Space that is pa$t along E B in a Time equal to the Time along E C
is le$s than the whole Space E B. And that the $ame Space along the
Perpendicular is greater than E C is mani-
fe$ted by rea$$uming the Figure of the pre-</I>
<fig>
<I>cedent Propo$ition, in which the part of the
Perpendicular B G hath been demon$trated
to be pa$$ed in the $ame Time as B C after
the Fall A B: But that B G is greater than
B C is thus collected. Becau$e B E and F B
are equal, and B A le$$er than B D, F B,
hath greater proportion to B A, than E B
hath to B D: And, by Compo$ition, F A
hath greater proportion to A B, than E D
to D B: But as F A is to A B, $o is G F
to F B, (for A F is the Mean-Proportional
between B A and A G:) And in like man-
ner, as E D is to B D, $o is C E to E B: Therefore G B hath greater
proportion to B F, than C B hath to B E: Therefore G B is greater

<P><I>From the Horizon A E let fall a Perpendicular A B, along which

in regard that as C E is

therefore al$o $o is C F to

$hall be le$$e than F G, and

<P><I>Let the unsqual Times be A the greater, and B the le$$er; and let

<I>tion, as the Length of the Plane hath to the Length of its Elevation,.

C D, that is, as the Time A is to the Time B: But the Time B is that
in which the Perpendicular is pa$t</I> ex quiete: <I>Therefore the Time A is
that in which the Plane C X is pa$$ed.</I></P>

<P><I>Along the Perpendicular A S, in the Time A C, let the Space
A C be pa$t</I> ex quiete <I>in A; to which let I R be more than
double, and le$$e than triple. It is required from the Terme C
to inflect a Plane, along which a Moveable after the Fall along A C
may in the $ame Time A C pa$$e a Space equal to the $aid I R. Let
R N, and N M be equal to A C: And look what proportion the part
I M hath to M N, the $ame $hall the Line A C have to another, equal
to which draw C E from C to</I>
<fig>
<I>the Horizon A E, which con-
tinue out towards O, and take
C F, F G, and G O, equal to
the $aid R N, N M, and M I.
I $ay, that the Time along the
inflected Plane C O, after the
Fall A G, is equal to the Time
A C out of Re$t in A. For in
regard that as O G is to G F,
$o is F C to C E by Compo$ition it $hall be that as O F is to F G or F C,
$o is F E to E C; and as one of the Antecedents is to one of the Con-
$equents, $o are all to all; that is, the whole O E is to E F as F E to
E C: Therefore O E, E F, and E C are Continual Proportionals:</I>
<foot><I>And</I></foot>
<p n=>179</p>
<I>And $ince it was $uppo$ed that the Time along A C is as A C, C E $hall
be the Time along E C; and E F the Time along the whole E O; and
the part C F that along the part C O: But C F is equal to the $aid C A:
Therefore that is done which was required: For the Time C A is the
Time of the Fall along A C</I> ex quiete <I>in A; and C F (which is equal
to C A) is the Time along C O, after the De$cent along E C, or after
the Fall along A C: Which was the Propo$ition.</I></P>
<P><I>And here it is to be noted, that the $ame may happen if the preceding
Motion be not made along the Perpendicular, but along an Inclined Plane:
As in the following Figure, in which let the preceding Lation be made
along the inclined Plane A S beneath the Horizon A E: And the Demon-
$tration is the very $ame.</I></P>
<head>SCHOLIUM.</head>
<P>If one ob$erve well, it $hall be manife$t, that the le$$e the given
Line I R wanteth of being triple to the $aid A C, the nearer
$hall the Inflected Plane, along which the $econd Motion is
to be made, which $uppo$e to be C O, come to the Perpen-
dicular, along which in a Time equal to A C a Space $hall
be pa$$ed triple to A C.</P>
<P><I>For in ca$e I R were very near the triple of A C, I M $hould be well-
near equal to M N: And if, as I M is to M N by Con$truction, $o
A C is to C E, then it is evident that the $aid C E will be found but
little bigger than C A, and, which followeth of con$equence, the point E
$hall be found very near the point A, and C O to containe a very acute</I>
<fig>
<I>Angle with C S, and
almo$t to concur both in
one Line. And on the
contrary, if the $aid I R
were but a very little
more than double the
$aid A C, I M $hould
be a very $hort Line.
Hence it may happen
al$o that A C may come
to be very $hort in re$pect of C E which $hall be very long, and $hall ap-
proach very near the Horizontal Parallel drawn from C. And from
hence we may collect, that if in the pre$ent Figure after the De$cent along
the inclined Plane A C, a Reflexion be made along the Horizontal Line,
as</I> v. gr. <I>C T, the Space along which the Moveable afterwards moved
in a Time equal to the Time of the De$cent along A C would be exactly
double to the Space A C. And it appears that the like Di$cour$e may be
here applied: For it is apparent by what hath been $aid, that $ince O E</I>
<foot><I>Aa</I> 2 <I>is</I></foot>
<p n=>180</p>
<I>is to E F, as F E is to E C, that F C determineth the Time along C O:
And if a part of the Horizontal Line T C double to C A be divided in
two equal parts in V, the exten$ion towards X $hall be prolonged</I> in in-
finitum, <I>whil$t it $eeks to meet with the prolonged Line A E: And the
proportion of the Infinite Line T X to the Infinite Line V X, $hall be
no other than the proportion of the Infinite Line V X to the Infinite
Line X C.</I></P>
<P><I>We may conclude the $elf-$ame thing another way by rea$$uming the
$ame Rea$oning that we u$ed in the Demon$tration of the fir$t Propo$i-
tion. For re$uming the Triangle A B C, repre$enting to us by its Pa-
rallels to the Ba$e B C the Degrees of Velocity continually encrea$ed ac-
cording to the encrea$es of the Time; from which, $ince they are infi-
nite, like as the Points are infinite in the Line A C, and the In$tants
in any Time, $hall re$ult the Superficies of that $ame Triangle, if we
under$tand the Motion to continue for $uch another Time, but no far-
ther with an Accelerate, but with an Equable Motion, according to the
greate$t degree of Velocity acquired, which degree is repre$ented
by the Line B C. Of $uch degrees $hall be made up an Aggregate like to
a Parallelogram A D B C, which is the double of</I>
<fig>
<I>the Triangle A B C. Wherefore the Space which
with degrees like to tho$e $hall be pa$$ed in the $ame
Time, $hall be double to the Space pa$t with the de-
grees of Velocity repre$ented by the Triangle A B C:
But along the Horizontal Plane the Motion is Equa-
ble, for that there is no cau$e of Acceleration, or Re-
tardation: Therefore it may be concluded that the
Space C D, pa$$ed in a Time equall to the Time A C is double to the
Space A C: For this Motion is made</I> ex quiete <I>Accelerate according
to the Parallels of the Triangle; and that according to the Parallels
of the Parallelogram, which, becau$e they are infinite, are donble to
the infinite Parallels of the Triangle.</I></P>
<P><I>Moreover it may farther be ob$erved, that what ever degree of
$wiftne$s is to be found in the Moveable, is indelibly impre$$ed upon it
of its own nature, all external cau$es of Acceleration or Retardation
being removed; which hapneth only in Horizontal Planes: for in de-
clining Planes there is cau$e of greater Acceleration, and in the ri$ing
Planes of greater Retardation. From whence in like manner it fol-
loweth that the Motion along the Horizontal Plane is al$o Perpetual:
for if it be Equable, it can neither be weakned nor retarded, nor much
le$$e de$troyed. Farthermore, the degree of Celerity acquired by the
Moveable in a Natural De$cent, being of its own Nature Indelible and
Penpetual, it is worthy con$ideration, that if after the De$cent along a
declining Plane a Reflexion be made along another Plane that is ri$ing,
in this latter there is cau$e of Retardation, for in the$e kind of Planes</I>
<foot><I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>181</p>
<I>the $aid Moveable doth naturally de$cend; whereupon there re$ults a
mixture of certain contrary Affections, to wit, that degree of Celerity
acquired in the precedent De$cent, which would of it $elf carry the Move-
able uniformly</I> in infinitum, <I>and of Natural Propen$ion to the Motion of
De$cent according to that $ame proportion of Acceleration wherewith it
alwaies moveth. So that it will be but rea$onable, if, enquiring what
accidents happen when the Moveable after the De$cent along any incli-
ned Plane is Reflected along $ome ri$ing Plane, we take that greate$t de-
gree acquired in the De$cent to keep it $elf perpetually the $ame in the
A$cending Plane; But that there is $uperadded to it in the A$cent the
Natural Inclination downwards, that is the Motion from Re$t Accelerate
according to the received proportion: And le$t this $hould, perchance, be
$omewhat intricate to be under$tood, it $hall be more clearly explained by a
Scheme.</I></P>
<P><I>Let the De$cent therefore be $uppo$ed to be made along the Declining
Plane A B, from which let the Reflex Motion be continued along another
Ri$ing Plane B C: And in the fir$t place let the Planes be equal, and
elevated at equal Angles to the Horizon G H. Now it is manife$t, that
the Moveable</I> ex quiete <I>in A de$cending along A B acquireth degrees of
Velocity according to the increa$e of its Time, and that the degree in B
is the greate$t of tho$e acquired and by Nature immutably impre$$ed, I
mean the Cau$es of new Acceleration or Retardation being removed:
of Acceleration, I $ay, if it $hould pa$$e any farther along the extended
Plane; and of Retardation, whil$t the Reflection is making along the
Acclivity B C: But along the Horizontal Plane G H the Equable Mo-
tion according to the de-</I>
<fig>
<I>gree of Velocity acquired
from A unto B would ex-
tend</I> in infinitum. <I>And
$uch a Velocity would
that be which in a Time
equal to the Time of the
De$cent along A B would pa$$e a Space in double the Horizon to the $aid
A B. Now let us $uppo$e the $ame Moveable to be Equably moved with
the $ame degree of Swiftne$$e along the Plane B C, in $uch $ort that al$o
in this Time equal to the Time of the De$cent along A B a Space may be
pa$$ed a long B C extended double to the $aid A B. And let us under-
$tand that as $oon as it beginneth to a$cend there naturally befalleth the
$ame that hapneth to it from A along the Plane A B, to wit, a certain
De$cent</I> ex quiete <I>according to tho$e degrees of Acceleration, by vertue
of which, as it befalleth in A B, it may de$cend as much in the $ame
Time along the Reflected Plane as it doth along A B: It is manife$t, that
by this $ame Mixture of the Equable Motion of A$cent, and the Acce-
lerate of De$cent the Moveable may be carried up to the Term C along
the Plane B C according to tho$e degrees of Velocity, which $hall be</I>
<foot><I>equal.</I></foot>
<p n=>182</p>
<I>equal. And that two points at plea$ure D and E being taken, equally
remote from the Angle B, the Tran$ition along D B is made in a Time
equal to the Time of the Reflection along B E, we may collect from hence:
Draw D F, which $hall be Parallel to B C; for it is manife$t that the
De$cent along A D is reflected along D F: And if after D the Move-

the $ame as the</I> Impetus <I>in D: Therefore it will a$cend from E to C:
And therefore the degree of Velocity in D is equal to the degree in E.
From the$e things, therefore, we may rationally affirm, that, if a de-
$cent be made along any inclined Plane, after which a Reflection may
follow along an elevated Plane, the Moveable may by the conceived</I>
Impetus <I>a$cend untill it attain the $ame beight, or Elevation from the
Horizon. As if a De$cent be made along A B, the Moveable would
pa$$e along the Reflected Plane B C, untill it arrive at the Horizon
A C D; and that not only when the Inclinations of the Planes are
equal, but al$o when they are unequal, as is the Plane B D: For it was
first $uppo$ed, that the degrees of Velocity are equal, which are acqui-
red upon Planes unequally inclined, $o long as the Elevation of tho$e
Planes above the Horizon was the $ame: But, if there being the $ame
Inclination of the Planes E B and B D, the De$cent along E B $ufficeth
to drive the Moveable along the Plane BD as far as D, $eeing this Impul$e</I>
<fig>
<I>is made by the</I> Impe-
tus <I>of Velocity in the
point B; and if the</I>
Impetus <I>be the $ame
in B, whether the
Moveable de$cend a-
long A B, or along E B: It is manife$t, that the Moveable $hall be in
the $ame manner driven along B D, after the De$cent along A B, and
after that along E B: But it will happen that the Time of the A$cent
along B D $hall be longer than along B C, like as the De$cent along
E B is made in a longer time than along A B: But the Proportion of
tho$e Times was before demon$trated to be the $ame as the Lengths of
tho$e Planes. Now it follows, that we $eek the proportion of the Spaces
pa$t in equal Times along Planes, who$e Inclinations are different, but
their Elevations the $ame; that is, which are comprehended between
the $ame Horizontal Parallels. And this hapneth according to the fol-

Again, let the Horizontal Space

It is manife$t that the Time of it
after the Fall E B is the $ame

along the Horizontal Plane is Equable, and O B being the Time along
B D after the Fall out of E, therefore N B $hall be the Time along B C
after the Fall from the $ame Altitude E. Hence it is manife$t, that O B,
together with B N is the Time along E B C; and becau$e the double of
B A is the Time along A B C; it remains to be proved, that O B, to-
gether with B N is more than double B A. Now becau$e O B is a Mean
between E B and B A, the proportion of E B to B A is double the pro-
portion of O B to B A: and, in regard that E B is to B A, as O B is to
B N, the proportion of O B to B N $hall al$o be double the proportion of
O B to B A: But that proportion of O B to B N is compounded of the
proportions of O B to B A, and of A B to B N: therefore the proportion
of A B to B N is the $ame with that of O B to B A. Therefore B O,

Draw the Horizontal Line X R Parallel to B C, with which let B A
being prolonged meet in R, and then A B being continued out unto D
draw E D Parallel to C B, and upon A D de$cribe a Semicircle, and
from B, and Perpendicular to D A, erect B F till it meet with the Cir-

A B and B D, and that the Line drawn from F to A is a Mean-propor-
tional betwixt D A and A B. Suppo$e B S equal to B I, and F H equal
to F B: And becau$e, as A B is to B D, $o is A C to C E, and becau$e
B F is a Mean-proportional betwixt A B and B D, and becau$e B I is a
Mean-proportional betwixt A C and C E; therefore as B A is to A C,
$o is F B to B S. And becau$e as B A is to A C, or A N, $o is F B to
B S, therefore, by Conver$ion of the proportion, B F is to F S, as A B is
to B N, that is, A L to L C; therefore the Rectangle under F B and
C L, is equal to the Rectangle under A L, and S F: But this Rectangle
A L, and S F, is the exce$$e of the Rectangle under A L and F B, or A I
and B F, over and above the Triangle A I and B S, or A I B; and the
Rectangle F B and L C is the exce$$e of the Rectangle A C and B F
over and above the Rectangle A L and B F: But the Rectangle A C and
B F is equal to the Rectangle A B I; (for as B A is to A C, $o is F B to
B I:) The exce$$e, therefore, of the Rectangle A B I above the Rectan-
gle A I and B F, or A I and F H, is equal to the exce$$e of the Rectangle
A I and F H above the Rectangle A I B: Therefore twice the Rectan-
gle A I and F H is equal to the two Rectangles A B I and A I B; that
is twice A I B with the Square of B I. Let the Square A I be common
to both, and twice the Rectangle A I B with the two Squares A I, and
I B, (that is, the Square A B) $hall be equal to twice the Rectangle
A I and F H, with the Square A I: Again, taking in commonly the
Square B F; the two Squares A B and B F, that is the $ole Square A F
$hall be equal to twice the Rectangle A I and F H, with the two Squares
A I and F B, that is A I and F H: But the $ame Square A F is equal
to twice the Rectangle A H F, with the two Squares A H and H F:
Therefore twice the Rectangle A I and F H, with the Squares A I and
F H, are equal to twice the Rectangle A H F, with the Squares A H
and H F: And, the Common Square H F being taken away, twice the
Rectangle A I and F H, with the Square A I, $hall be equal to twice the
Rectangle A H F, with the Square A H. And becau$e that in all the
Rectangles F H is the Common Side, the Line A H $hall be equal to A I:
For if it $hould be greater or le$$er, then the Rectangles F H A and the

<P><I>Now if we $uppo$e the Time of the De$cent along A B to be as A B,

<P><I>Let C B D be the Circumference not greater than a Quadrant of a

along the other only B C</I> ex quiete <I>in B. Let the Horizontal Line M D A</I>

<I>be drawn by D, with which let C B prolonged meet in A; and let fall
the Perpendiculars D N and M C to M D, and B N to B D; and about
the Right-angled Triangle D B N de$cribe the Semicircle D F B N,
cutting D C in F; and let D O be a Mean-proportional betwixt C D
and D F; and A V a Mean-proportional betwixt C A and A B: And
let P S be the time in which the whole D C, or B C, $hall be pa$$ed;
(for it is manife$t that they $hall be both pa$t in the $ame Time;) And
look what proportion C D hath to D O, the $ame $hall the Time S P
have to the Time P R: the Time P R $hall be that in which a Movea-
ble out of D will pa$$e D F; and R S that in which it $hall pa$$e the re-
mainder F C. And becau$e P S is al$o the Time in which the Movea-
ble out of B $hall pa$$e B C; if it be $uppo$ed that as B C is to C D, $o is
S P to P T, P T $hall be the Time of the De$cent out of A to C: by
rea$on D C is a Mean-proportional betwixt A C and C B, by what was
before demon$trated: La$t of all, as C A is to A V, $o let T P be to</I>
<fig>
<I>P G: P G $hall be the Time,
in which th&eacute; Moveable out
of A de$cendeth to B. And
becau$e of the Circle D F N
the Diameter erect to the
Horizon is D N, the Lines
D F and D B $hall be pa$-
$ed in equal Times. So that
if it $hould be demon$tra-
ted that the Moveable would
$ooner pa$$e B C after the
De$cent D B, than F C after the Lation D F; we $hould have our in-
tent. But the Moveable will with the $ame Celerity of Time pa$$e B C
coming out of D along D B, as if it came out of A along A B: for that
in both the De$cents D B and A B it acquireth equal Moments of Velo-
city: Therefore it $hall re$t to be demon$trated that the Time is $horter
in which B C is pa$$ed after A B, than that in which F C is pa$t after
D F. But it hath been demon$trated, that the Time in which B C is
pa$$ed after A B is G T; and the Time of F C after D F is R S. It is
to be proved therefore, that R S is greater than G T: Which is thus
done. Becau$e as S P is to P R, $o is C D to D O, therefore, by Conver-
$ion of proportion, and by Inver$ion, as R S is to S P, $o is O C to C D:
and as S P is to P T, $o is D C to C A: And, becau$e as T P is to PG,
$o is C A to A V: Therefore al$o, by Conver$ion of the proportion, as
P T is to T G, $o is A C to C V: therefore, ex equali, as R S is to G T,
$o is O C to C V. But O C is greater than C V, as $hall anon be de-
mon$trated: Therefore the Time R S is greater than the Time G T:
Which it was required to demon$trate. And becau$e C F is greater than
C B, and F D le$$e than B A, therefore C D $hall have greater propor-
tion to D F than C A to A B: And as C D is to D F, $o is the Square</I>
<foot><I>C O to</I></foot>
<p n=>201</p>
<I>C O to the Square O F; fora$much as C D, D O, and O F are Propor-
tionals: And as C A is to A B, $o is the Square C V to the Square
V B: Therefore C O hath greater proportion to O F, than C V to V B:
Therefore, by the foregoing Lemma, C O is greater than C V. It is
manife$t moreover, that the Time along D C is to the Time along
D B C, as D O C is to D O together with C V.</I></P>

<P>From the$e things that have been demon$trated may evidently
be gathered, that the $wifte$t of all Motions betwixt Term

Right, but along a portion of a Circle.</P>
<P><I>For in the Quadrat B A E C, who$e Side B C is erect to the Hori-
zon, let the Arch A C be divided into any number of equal parts,
A D, D E, E F, F G, G C; and let Right-lines be drawn from C to
the Points A, D, E, F, G, H; and al$o by Lines joyn A D, D E, E F,
F G. and G C. It is manifest, that the Motion along the two Lines
A D C is $ooner performed than along the</I>
<fig>
<I>$ole Line A C, or D C out of Re$t in D:
But out of Re$t in A, D C is $ooner pa$t
than the two A D C: But along the two
D E C out of Re$t in A the De$cent is
likewi$e $ooner made than along the $ole
C D: Therefore the De$cent along the
three Lines A D E C $hall be performed
$ooner than along the two A D C. And
in like manner the De$cent along A D E
preceding, the Motion is more $peedily con-
$ummated along the two EFC than along the $ole FC: Therfore along the
four A D E F C the Motion is quicklier accompli$hed than along the
three A D E C: And $o, in the la$t place, along the two F G C after the
precedent De$cent along A D E F the Motion will be $ooner con$umma-
ted than along the $ole F C: Therefore along the five A D E F G C
the De$cent $hall be effected in a yet $horter Time than along the four
A D E F C: Whereupon the nearer by in$cribed Poligons we approach
the Circumference, the $ooner will the Motion be performed between the
two a$$igned points A C.</I></P>

which <I>I</I> have ta$ted more of the $imple Propo$itions than of their
Demon$trations; many of which, <I>I</I> believe, will co$t me more than
an hour a piece well to comprehend them: a task that <I>I</I> re$erve to
my $elf to perform at lea$ure, you leaving the Book in my hands $o
$oon as we $hall have heard this part that remains about the Moti-
on of Projects: which $hall, if you $o plea$e, be to morrow.</P>

<P><I>Simplicius</I> likewi$e cometh in the nick of time, therefore
without interpo$ing any <I>Re$t</I> let us proceed to <I>Motion</I>;
and $ee here the <I>Text</I> of our <I>Author.</I></P>
<head>OF THE MOTION OF
PROJECTS.</head>
<P><I>What accidents belong to</I> Equable Motion, <I>as al$o to the</I> Na-
turally Accelerate <I>along all whatever Inclinations of Planes,
we have con$idered above. In this Contemplation which we are now
entering upon, I will attempt to declare, and with $olid Demon$trations</I>
<foot><I>to</I></foot>
<p n=>206</p>
<I>to e$tabli$h $ome of the principal Symptomes, and tho$e worthy of know-
ledge, which befall a Moveable whil$t it is moved with a Motion com-
pounded of a twofold Lation, to wit, of the Equable and Naturally-
Accelerate: and this is that Motion, which we call the Motion of Pro-
jects: who$e Generation I constitute to be in this manner.</I></P>
<P><I>I fancy in my mind a certain Moveable projected or thrown along
an Horizontal Plane, all impediment $ecluded: Now it is manife$t by
what we have el$ewhere $poken at large, that that Motion will be Equa-
ble and Perpetual along the $aid Plane, if the Plane be extended</I> in in-
finitum<I>: but if we $uppo$e it terminate, and placed on high, the Move-
able, which I conceive to be endued with Gravity, being come to the end
of the Plane, proceeding forward, it addeth to the Equable and Indeli-
ble fir$t Lation that propen$ion downwards which it receiveth from its
Gravity, and from thence a certain Motion doth re$ult compounded of
the Equable Horizontal, and of the De$cending naturally. Accellerate
Lations: which I call</I> Projection. <I>Some of who$e Accidents we will de-
mon$trate; the fir$t of which $hall be this.</I></P>
<head>THEOR.I. PROP.I.</head>
<P><I>A Project, when it is moved with a Motion compounded
of the Horizontal Equable, and of the Naturally-
Accelerate downwards, $hall de$cribe a Semipara-
bolical Line in its Lation.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. It is requi$ite, <I>Salviatus,</I> in favour of my $elf, and, as I
believe, al$o of <I>Simplicius,</I> here to make a pau$e; for I
am not $o far gone in Geometry as to have $tudied <I>Apol-
lonius,</I> $ave only $o far as to know that he treateth of the$e Para-
bola's, and of the other Conick Sections, without the knowledge
of which, and of their Pa$$ions, I do not think that one can under-
$tand the Demon$trations of other Propo$itions depending on
them. And becau$e already in the very fir$t Propo$ition it is pro-
po$ed by the Author to prove the Line de$cribed by the Project to
be Parabolical, I imagine to my $elf, that being to treat of none
but $uch Lines, it is ab$olutely nece$$ary to have a perfect know-
ledge, if not of all the Pa$$ions of tho$e Figures that are demon-
$trated by <I>Apollonius,</I> at lea$t of tho$e that are nece$$ary for the Sci-
ence in hand.</P>
<P>SALV. You undervalue your $elf very much, to make $trange
of tho$e Notions, which but even now you admitted as very well
under$tood: I told you heretofore, that in the Treati$e of Re$i-
$tances we had need of the knowledge of certain Propo$itions of
<foot><I>Apollonius,</I></foot>
<p n=>207</p>
<I>Apollonius,</I> at which you made no $eruple.</P>
<P>SAGR. It may be either that I knew them by chance, or that I
might for once gue$$e at, and take for granted $o much as $erved my
turn in that Tractate: but here where I imagine that we are to
hear all the Demon$trations that concern tho$e Lines, it is not con-
venient, as we $ay, to $wallow things whole, lo$ing our time and
pains.</P>
<P>SIMP. But as to what concerns me, although <I>Sagredus</I> were,
as I believe he is, well provided for his occa$ions, the very fir$t
Terms already are new to me: for though our Philo$ophers have
handled this Argument of the Motion of Projects, I do not remem-
ber that they have confined them$elves to de$ine what the Lines
are which they de$cribe, $ave only in general that they are alwaies
Curved Lines, except it be in Projections Perpendicularly upwards.
Therefore in ca$e that little Geometry that I have learnt from <I>Eu-
clid</I> $ince the Time that we have had other Conferences, be not $uf-
ficient to render me capable of the Notions requi$ite for the under-
$tanding of the following Demon$trations, I mu$t content my $elf
with bare Propo$itions believed, but not under$tood.</P>
<P>SALV. But I will have you to know them by help of the Au-
thor of this Book him$elf, who when he heretofore granted me a
$ight of this his Work, becau$e I al$o at that time was not perfect
in the Books of <I>Apollonius,</I> took the pains to demon$trate to me
two mo$t principal Pa$$ions of the Parabola without any other Pre-
cognition, of which two, and no more, we $hall $tand in need in
the pre$ent Treati$e; which are both likewi$e proved by <I>Apollonius,</I>
but after many others, which it would take up a long time to look
over, and I am de$irous that we may much $horten the Journey, ta-
king the fir$t immediately from the pure and $imple generation of
the $aid Parabola, and from this al$o immediately $hall be deduced
the Demon$tration of the $econd. Coming therefore to the fir$t;</P>
<P>De$cribe the Right Cone, who$e Ba$e let be the Circle I B K C,
and Vertex the point L, in which, cut by a Plane parallel to the
<fig>
Side L K, ari$eth the Section B A C
called a Parabola; and let its Ba$e
B C cut the Diameter I K of the
Circle I B K C at Right-Angles;
and let the Axis of the Parabola
A D be Parallel to the $ide L K;
and taking any point F in the Line
B F A, draw the Right-Line F E
parallel to B D. I $ay, that the Square
of B D hath to the Square of F E
the $ame proportion that the Axis
D A hath to the part A E. Let a Plane parallel to the Circle I B K C
<foot>be</foot>
<p n=>208</p>
be $uppo$ed to pa$$e by the Point E, which $hall make in the Cone
a Circular Section, who$e Diameter is G E H. And becau$e upon
the Diameter I K of the Circle I B K, B D is a Perpendicular, the
Square of B D $hall be equal to the Rectangle made by the parts
I D and D K: And likewi$e in the upper Circle which is under$tood
to pa$$e by the points G F H, the Square of the Line F E is equal
to the Rectangle of the parts G E H: Therefore the Square of B D
hath the $ame proportion to the Square of F E, that the Rectangle
I D K hath to the Rectangle G E H. And becau$e the Line E D is
Parallel to H K, E H $hall be equal to D K, which al$o are Parallels:
And therefore the Rectangle I D K $hall have the $ame proportion
to the Rectangle G E H, as I D hath to G E; that is, that D A hath
to A E: Therefore the Rectangle I D K to the Rectangle G E H,
that is, the Square B D to the Square F E, hath the $ame proportion
that the Axis D A hath to the part A E: Which was to be de-
mon$trated.</P>
<P>The other Propo$ition, likewi$e nece$$ary to the pre$ent Tract,
we will thus make out. Let us de$cribe the Parabola, of which let the
Axis C A be prolonged out unto D; and taking any point B, let the
Line B C be $uppo$ed to be continued out by the $ame Parallel un-
<fig>
to the Ba$e of the $aid Parabola;
and let D A be $uppo$ed equal
to the part of the Axis C A. I $ay,
that the Right-Line drawn by
the points D and B, falleth not
within the Parabola, but without,
$o as that it only toucheth the
$ame in the $aid point B: For, if
it be po$$ible for it to fall within,
it cutteth it above, or being pro-
longed, it cutteth it below. And
in that Line let any point G be
taken, by which pa$$eth the Right
Line F G E. And becau$e the
Square F E is greater than the
Square G E, the $aid Square F E
$hall have greater proportion to
the Square B C, than the $aid Square G E hath to the $aid B C. And
becau$e, by the precedent, the Square F E is to the Square B C as
E A is to A C; therefore E A hath greater proportion to A C, than
the Square G E hath to the Square B C; that is, than the Square
E D hath to the Square D C: (becau$e in the Triangle D G E as
G E is to the Parallel B C, $o is E <I>D</I> to <I>D</I> C:) But the Line E A to
A C, that is, to A <I>D</I> hath the $ame proportion that four Rectangles
E A <I>D</I> hath to four Squares of A <I>D,</I> that is, to the Square C <I>D,</I>
<foot>(which</foot>
<p n=>209</p>
(which is equal to four Squares of A D:) Therefore four Rectan-
gles E A D $hall have greater proportion to the Square C D, than
the Square E D hath to the Square D C: Therefore four Rectan-
gles E A D $hall be greater than the Square E D: which is fal$e,
for they are le$$e; becau$e the parts E A and A D of the Line E D
are not equal: Therefore the Line D B toucheth the Parabola in B,
and doth not cut it: Which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<P>SIMP. You proceed in your Demon$trations too $ublimely,
and $till, as far as I can perceive, $uppo$e that the Propo$itions of
<I>Euclid</I> are as familiar and ready with me, as the fir$t Axioms them-
$elves, which is not $o. And the impo$ing upon me, ju$t now, that
four Rectangles E A <I>D</I> are le$s than the Square <I>D</I> E becau$e the
parts E A and A <I>D</I> of the Line E <I>D</I> are not equal, doth not $atis$ie
me, but leaveth me in doubt.</P>
<P>SALV. The truth is, all the Mathematicians that are not vulgar
$uppo$e that the Reader hath ready by heart the Elements of
<I>Euclid</I>: And here to $upply your want, it $hall $u$fice to remember
you of a Propo$ition in the $econd Book, in which it is demon$trated
that when a Line is cut into equal parts, and into unequal, the
Rectangle of the unequal parts is le$s than the Rectangle of the
equal, (that is, than the Square of the half) by $o much as is the
Square of the Line comprized between the Sections. Whence it is
manife$t, that the Square of the whole, which continueth four
Squares of the Half, is greater than four Rectangles of the unequal
parts. Now it is nece$$ary that we bear in mind the$e two Propo$i-
tions which have been demon$trated, taken from the Conick Ele-
ments, for the better under$tanding the things that follow in the
pre$ent Treati$e: for of the$e two, and no more, the Author
makes u$e. Now we may rea$$ume the Text to $ee in what manner
he doth demon$trate his fir$t Propo$ition, in which he intendeth to
prove unto us, That the Line de$cribed by the Grave Moveable,
when it de$cends with a Motion compounded of the Equable
Horizontal, and of the Natural <I>D</I>e$cending is a Semiparabola.</P>
<P><I>Suppo$e the Horizontal Line or Plane A B placed on high; upon</I>
[or along] <I>which let the Moveable pa$$e with an Equable Motion out
of A unto B: and the $upport of the Plane failing in B let there be
derived upon the Moveable from its own Gravity a Motion naturally
downwards according to the Perpendicular B N. Let the Line B E be
$uppo$ed applyed unto the Plane A B right out, as if it were the Efflux
or mea$ure of the Time, on which at plea$ure note any equal parts of
Time, B C, C D, D E: And out of the points B C D E $uppo$e Per-
pendicular Lines to be let fall equidi$tant or parallel to B N: In the fir$t
of which take any part C I, who$e quadruple take in the following one
D F, nonuple E H, and $o in the re$t that follow according to the propor-</I>
<foot>Ee <I>tion</I></foot>
<p n=>210</p>
<I>tion of the Squares of C B, D B, E B, or, if you will, in the doubled
proportion of the Lines. And if unto the Moveable moved beyond B
towards C with the Equable Lation we $uppo$e the Perpendicular
De$cent to be $uperadded according to the quantity C I, in the Time
B C it $hall be found con$tituted in the Term I. And proceeding farther,</I>
<fig>
<I>in the Time D B, namely,
in the double of B C, the
Space of the De$cent down-
wards $hall be quadruple to
the fir$t Space C I: For
it hath beendemon$trated in
the fir$t Trastate, that the
Spaces pa$$ed by GraveBo-
dies with a Motion Natu-
rally Accelerate are in du-
plicate proportion of their Times. And it likewi$e followeth, that the
Space E H pa$$ed in the Time B E, $hall be as G. So that it is manife$tly
proved, that the Spaces E H, D F, C I, are to one another as the Squares
of the Lines E B, D B, C B. Now from the points I, F, and H draw
the Right Lines I O, F G, H L, Parallel to the $aid E B; and each of
the Lines H L, F G, and I O $hall be equal to each of the other Lines
E B, D B, and C B; as al$o each of tho$e B O, B G, and B L, $hall be
equal to each of tho$e C I, D F, and E H: And the Square H L $hall
be to the Square F G, as the Line L B to B G: And the Square F G
$hall be to the Square I O, as G B to B O: Therefore the Points I, F,
and H are in one and the $ame Parabolical Line. And in like manner
it $hall be demon$trated, any equalparticles of Time of what$oever Mag-
nitude being taken, that the place of the Moveable who$e Motion is
compounded of the like Lations, is in the $ame Times to be found in the
$ame Parabolick Line: Therefore the Propo$ition is manife$t.</I></P>
<P>SALV. This Conclu$ion is gathered from the Conver$ion of the
fir$t of tho$e two Propo$itions that went before, for the Parabola
being, for example, de$cribed by the points B H, if either of the
two F or I were not in the de$cribed Parabolick Line, it would be
within, or without; and by con$equence the Line F G would be
either greater or le$$er than that which $hould determine in the Pa-
rabolick Line; Wherefore the Square of HL would have, not to
the Square of F G, but to another greater or le$$er, the $ame pro-
portion that the Line L B hath to BG, but it hath the $ame propor-
tion to the Square of F G: Therefore the point F is in the Parabo-
lick Line: And $o all the re$t, <I>&amp;c.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. It cannot be denied but that the Di$cour$e is new, in-
genious and concludent, arguing <I>ex $uppo$itione,</I> that is, $uppo$ing
that the Tran$ver$e Motion doth continue alwaies Equable, and
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>211</p>
that the Natural <I>Dcor$um</I> do likewi$e keep its tenour of continu-
ally Accelerating according to a proportion double to the Times;
and that tho$e Motions and their Velocities in mingling be not al-
tered, di$turbed, and impeded, $o that finally the Line of the Pro-
ject do not in the continuation of the Motion degenerate into an-
other kind; a thing which $eemeth to me to be impo$$ible. For, in
regard that the Axis of our Parabola, according to which we $up-
po$e the Natural Motion of Graves to be made, being Perpendicu-
lar to the Horizon, doth terminate in the Center of the Earth; and
in regard that the Parabolical Line doth $ucce$$ively enlarge from
its Axis, no Project would ever come to terminate in the Center, or
if it $hould come thitherwards, as it $eemeth nece$$ary that it mu$t,
the Line of the Project $hould de$cribe another mo$t different from
that of the Parabola.</P>
<P>SIMP. I add to the$e difficulties $everal others; one of which is
that we $uppo$e, that the Horizontal Plane which hath neither accli-
vity or declivity is a Right Line; as if that $uch a Line were in all
its parts equidi$tant from the Center, which is not true: for depart-
ing from its middle it goeth towards the extreams, alwaies more and
more receding from the Center, and therefore alwaies a$cending:
which of con$equence rendereth it Impo$$ible that its Motion
$hould be perpetual, or that it $hould for any time continue Equa-
ble, and nece$$itates it to grow continually more and more weak.
Moreover, it is, in my Opinion, impo$$ible to avoid the Impedi-
ment of the <I>Medium,</I> but that it will take away the Equability of
the Tran$ver$e Motion, and the Rule of the Acceleration in falling
Grave Bodies. By all which difficulties it is rendred very improba-
ble that the things demon$trated with $uch incon$tant Suppo$i-
tions $hould afterwards hold true in the practical Experiments.</P>
<P>SALV. All the Objections and Difficulties alledged are $o
well grounded, that I e$teem it impo$$ible to remove them; and
for my own part I admit them all, as al$o I believe the Author
him$elf would do. And I grant that the Conclu$ions thus demon-
$trated in Ab$tract, do alter and prove fal$e, and that $o egregiou$-
ly, in Concrete, that neither is the Tran$ver$e Motion Equable,
nor is the Acceleration of the Natural in the proportion $uppo$e,
nor is the Line of the Project Parabolical, <I>&amp;c. B</I>ut yet on the
contrary, I de$ire that you would not $cruple to grant to this our
Author that which other famous Men have $uppo$ed, although
fal$e. And the $ingle Authority of <I>Archimedes</I> may $atisfie every
one: who in his Mechanicks, and in the fir$t Quadrature of the
Parabola, taketh it as a true Principle, that the <I>B</I>eam of the <I>B</I>allance
or Stilliard is a Right Line in all its points equidi$tant from the
Common Center of Grave <I>B</I>odies, and that the Scale-ropes, to
which the Weights are hanged, are parallel to one another. Which
<foot>Ee 2 Liberty</foot>
<p n=>212</p>
Liberty of his hath been excu$ed by $ome, for that in our practices
the In$truments we u$e, and the Di$tances which we take are $o
$mall in compari$on of our great remotene$s from the Center of
the Terre$trial Globe, that we may very well take a Minute of a
degree of the great Circle as if it were a Right Line, and two Per-
pendiculars that $hould hang at its extreams as if they were Paral-
lels. For if we were in practical Operations to keep account of
$uch like Minutes, we $hould begin to reprove the Architects, who
with the Plumb Line $uppo$e that they rai$e very high Towers
between Lines equidi$tant. And I here add, that we may $ay that
<I>Archimedes,</I> and others $uppo$e in their Contemplations that they
were con$tituted remote at an infinite di$tance from the Center;
in which ca$e their A$$umptions were not fal$e: And that therefore
they did conclude by Ab$olute Demon$tration. Again, if we will
practice the demon$trated Conclu$ions in terminate Di$tances, by
$uppo$ing an immen$e Di$tance, we ought to defalk from the
truth demon$trated that which our Di$tance from the Center doth
import, not being really infinite, but yet $uch as that it may be
termed Immen$e in compari$on of the Artifices that we make u$e
of, the greate$t of which will be the Ranges of Projects, and among$t
the$e that only of Canon $hot; which though it be great, yet $hall
it not exceed four of tho$e Miles of which we are remote from the
Center well-nigh $o many thou$ands: and the$e coming to deter-
mine in the Surface of the Terre$trial Globe may very well only in-
$en$ibly alter that Parabolick Figure, which we grant would be
extreamly transformed in going to determine in the Center. In
the next place as to the perturbation proceeding from the Impedi-
ment of the <I>Medium,</I> this is more con$iderable, and, by rea$on of
its $o great multiplicity of Varieties, incapable of being brought
under any certain Rules, and reduced to a Science: for if we
$hould propo$e to con$ideration no more but the Impediment which
the Air procureth to the Motions con$idered by us, this alone $hall
be found to di$turb all, and that infinite waies, according as we
infinite waies vary the Figures, Gravities, and Velocities of the
Moveables. For as to the Velocity, according as this $hall be grea-
ter, the greater $hall the oppo$ition be that the Air makes again$t
them, which $hall yet more impede the $aid Moveable according as
they are le$s Grave: $o that although the de$cending Grave Body
ought to go Accelerating in a duplicate proportion to the Duration
of its Motion, yet neverthele$s, albeit the Moveable were very
Grave, in coming from very great heights, the Impediment of the
Air $hall be $o great, as that it will take from it all power of far-
ther encrea$ing its Velocity, and will reduce it to an Uniform and
Equable Motion: And this Adequation $hall be $o much the $ooner
obtained, and in $o much le$$er heights, by how much the Moveable
<foot>$hall</foot>
<p n=>213</p>
$hall be le$s Grave. That Motion al$o which along the Horizontal
Plane, all other Ob$tacles being removed, ought to be Equable
and perpetual, $hall come to be altered, and in the end arre$ted by
the Impediment of the Air: and here likewi$e $o much the $ooner,
by how much the Moveable $hall be Lighter. Of which Accidents
of Gravity, of Velocity, and al$o of Figure, as being varied $eve-
ral waies, there can no fixed Science be given. And therefore that
we may be able Scientifically to treat of this Matter it is requi$ite
that we ab$tract from them; and, having found and demon$trated
the Conclu$ions ab$tracted from the Impediments, that we make
u$e of them in practice with tho$e Limitations that Experience $hall
from time to time $hew us. And yet neverthele$s the benefit $hall
not be $mall, becau$e $uch Matters, and their Figures $hall be made
choice of as are le$s $ubject to the Impediments of the <I>Medium</I>;
$uch are the very Grave, the Rotund: and the Spaces, and the
Velocities for the mo$t part will not be $o great, but that their ex-
orbitances may with ea$ie ^{*} Allowance be reduced to a certainty.
<marg>* Tarra.</marg>
Yea more, in Projects practicable by us, that are of Grave Matters,
and of Round Figure, and al$o that are of Matters le$$e Grave,
and of Cylindrical Figure, as Arrows, $hot from Slings or Bows,
the variation of their Motion from the exact Parabolical Figure
$hall be altogether in$en$ible. Nay, (and I will a$$ume to my $elf
a little more freedom) that in ^{*} In$truments that are practicable by
<marg>* Artifizii.</marg>
us, their $malne$s rendreth the extern and accidental Impediments,
of which that of the <I>Medium</I> is mo$t con$iderable, to be but of
very $mall note, I am able by two experiments to make manife$t.
I will con$ider the Motions made thorow the Air, for $uch are tho$e
chiefly of which we $peak: again$t which the $aid Air in two man-
ners exerci$eth its power. The one is by more impeding the Movea-
bles le$s Grave, than tho$e very Grave. The other is in more oppo-
$ing the greater than the le$s Velocity of the $ame Moveable. As
to the fir$t; Experience $hewing us that two Balls of equal
bigne$s, but in weight one ten or twelve times more Grave than the
other, as, for example, one of Lead and another of Oak would
be, de$cending from an height of 150, or 200 Yards, arrive to the
Earth with Velocity very little different, it a$$ureth us that the Im-
pediment or Retardment of the Air in both is very $mall: for if
the <I>B</I>all of Lead departing from on high in the $ame Moment with
that of Wood, were but little retarded, and this much, the Lead at
its coming to the ground $hould leave the Wood a very con$idera-
ble Space behind, $ince it is ten times more Grave; which never-
thele$s doth not happen: nay, its Anticipation $hall not be $o
much as the hundredth part of the whole height. And between a
<I>B</I>all of Lead, and another of Stone which weighs a third part, or
half $o much as it, the difference of the Times of their coming to
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>214</p>
the ground would be hardly ob$ervable. Now becau$e the <I>Impe-
tus</I> that a <I>B</I>all of Lead acquireth in falling from an height of 200
Yards (which is $o much that continuing it in an Equable Moti-
on it would in a like Time run 400 Yards) is very con$iderable in
compari$on of the Velocity that we confer with <I>B</I>ows or other Ma-
chines, upon our Projects (excepting the <I>Impetus's</I> that depend
on the Fire) we may without any notable Errour conclude and
account the Propo$itions to be ab$olutely true that are demon$tra-
ted without any regard had to the alteration of the <I>Medium.</I> In
the next place as touching the other part, that is to $hew, that the
Impediment that the $aid Moveable receiveth from the Air whil$t
it moveth with great Velocity is not much greater than that which
oppo$eth it in moving $lowly, the en$uing Experiment giveth us
full a$$urance of it. Su$pend by two threads both of the $ame
length, <I>v. gr.</I> four or five Yards, two equal <I>B</I>alls of Lead: and
having fa$tned the $aid threads on high, let both the <I>B</I>alls be re-
moved from the $tate of Perpendicularity; but let the one be re-
moved 80. or more degrees, and the other not above 4 or 5: $o
that one of them being left at liberty de$cendeth, and pa$$ing be-
yond the Perpendicular, de$cribeth very great Arches of 160, 150,
140, <I>&amp;c.</I> degrees, dimini$hing them by little and little: but the
other $winging freely pa$$eth little Arches of 10, 8, 6, <I>&amp;c.</I> this
al$o dimini$hing them in like manner by little and little. Here I
$ay, in the fir$t place, that the fir$t <I>B</I>all $hall pa$s its 180, 160, <I>&amp;c.</I>
degrees in as much Time as the other doth its 10, 8, <I>&amp;c.</I> From
whence it is manife$t, that the Velocity of the fir$t <I>B</I>all $hall be 16
and 18 times greater than the Velocity of the $econd: $o that in
ca$e the greater Velocity were to be more impeded by the Air than
<marg>Or $ewer.</marg>
the le$$er, the Vibrations $hould be more ^{*} rare in the greate$t
Arches of 180, or 160 degrees, <I>&amp;c.</I> than in the lea$t of 10, 8, 4,
and al$o of 2, and of 1; but this is contradicted by Experience:
for if two A$$i$tants $hall $et them$elves to count the Vibrations,
one the greate$t, the other the lea$t, they will find that they $hall
number not only tens, but hundreds al$o, without di$agreeing one
$ingle Vibration, yea, or one $ole point. And this ob$ervati-
on joyntly a$$ureth us of the two Propo$itions, namely, that the
greate$t and lea$t Vibrations are all made one after another under
equal Times, and that the Impediment and Retardment of the Air
operates no more in the $wifte$t Motion, than in the $lowe$t:
contrary to that which before it $eemed that we our $elves al$o
would have judged for company.</P>
<P>SAGR. Rather, becau$e it cannot be denied but that the Air
impedeth both tho$e and the$e, $ince they both continually grow
more languid, and at la$t cea$e, it is requi$ite to $ay that tho$e Re-
tardations are made with the $ame proportion in the one and in the
<foot>other</foot>
<p n=>215</p>
other Operation. And then, the being to make greater Re$i$tance
at one time than at another, from what other doth it proceed, but
only from its being a$$ailed at one time with a greater <I>Impetus</I> and
Velocity, and at another time with le$$er? And if this be $o then the
$ame quantity of the Velocity of the Moveable is at once the Cau$e
and the Mealure of the quantity of the Re$i$tance. Therefore all
Motions, whether they be $low or $wift, are retarded and impe-
ded in the $ame proportion: a Notion in my judgment not con-
temptible.</P>
<P>SALV. We may al$o in this $econd ca$e conclude, That the
Fallacies in the Conclu$ions, which are demon$trated, ab$tracting
from the extern Accidents, are in our In$truments of very $mall
con$ideration, in re$pect of the Motions of great Velocities of
which for the mo$t part we $peak, and of the Di$tances which are
but very $mall in relation to the Semidiameter and great Circles of
the Terre$trial Globe.</P>
<P>SIMP. I would gladly hear the rea$on why you $eque$trate
the Projects from the <I>Impetus</I> of the Fire, that is, as I conceive from
the force of the Powder, from the other Projects made by Slings,
Bows, or Cro$s-bows, touching their not being in the $ame manner
$ubject to the Acceleration and Impediment of the Air.</P>
<P>SALV. I am induced thereto by the exce$$ive, and, as I may $ay,
Supernatural Fury or Impetuou$ne$s with which tho$e Projects are
driven out: For indeed I think that the Velocity with which a <I>B</I>ul-
let is $hot out of a Musket or Piece of Ordinance may without any
Hyperbole be called Supernatural. For one of tho$e <I>B</I>ullets de-
$cending naturally thorow the Air from $ome immen$e height, its
Velocity, by rea$on of the Re$i$tance of the Air will not go in-
crea$ing perpetually: but that which in Cadent <I>B</I>odies of $mall
Gravity is $een to happen in no very great ^{*} Space, I mean their
<marg>* Or Way.</marg>
being reduced in the end to an Equable Motion, $hall al$o happen
after a De$cent of thou$ands of yards, in a <I>B</I>all of Iron or Lead:
and this determinate and ultimate Velocity may be $aid to be the
greate$t that $uch a <I>B</I>ody can obtain or acquire thorow the Air:
which Velocity I account to be much le$$er than that which cometh
to be impre$$ed on the $ame <I>B</I>all by the fired Powder. And of this
a very appo$ite Experiment may adverti$e us. At an height of an
hundred or more yards let off a Musket charged with a Leaden
<I>B</I>ullet perpendicularly downwards upon a Pavement of Stone; and
with the $ame Musket $hoot again$t $uch another Stone at the Di-
$tance of a yard or two, and then $ee which of the two <I>B</I>ullets is
more flatted: for if that coming from on high be le$s ^{*} dented than
<marg>* Or battered.</marg>
the other, it $hall be a $ign that the Air hath impeded it, and dimi-
ni$hed the Velocity conferred upon it by the Fire in the beginning
of the Motion: and that, con$equently, $o great a Velocity the Air
<foot>would</foot>
<p n=>216</p>
would not $uffer it to gain coming from never $o great an height:
for in ca$e the Velocity impre$$ed upon it by the Fire $hould not
exceed that which it might acquire of its $elf de$cending naturally,
the battery downwards ought rather to be more valid than le$s.
I have not made $uch an Experiment, but incline to think that a
Musket or Cannon Bullet falling from never $o great an height,
will not make that percu$$ion which it maketh in a Wall at a Di-
$tance of a few yards, that is of $o few that the $hort perforation,
or, if you will, Sci$$ure to be made in the Air $ufficeth not to ob-
viate the exce$s of the $upernatural impetuo$ity impre$$ed on it by
the Fire. This exce$$ive <I>Impetus</I> of $uch like forced $hots may
cau$e $ome deformity in the Line of the Projection; making
the beginning of the Parabola le$s inclined or curved than the end.
<I>B</I>ut this can be but of little or no prejudice to our Author in
practical Operations: among$t the which the principal is the com-
po$ition of a Table for the Ranges, or Flights, which containeth
the di$tances of the Falls of <I>B</I>alls $hot according to all Elevations.
And becau$e the$e kinds of Projections are made with Mortar-
Pieces, and with no great charge; in the$e the <I>Impetus</I> not being
$upernatural, the Ranges de$cribe their Lines very exactly.</P>
<P><I>B</I>ut for the pre$ent let us proceed forwards in the Treati$e,
where the Author de$ireth to lead us to the Contemplation and
Inve$tigation of the <I>Impetus</I> of the Moveable whil$t it moveth
with a Motion compounded of two. And fir$t of that compoun-
ded of two Equable Motions; the one Horizontal, and the other
Perpendicular.</P>
<head>THEOR. II. PROP. II.</head>
<P>If any Moveable be moved with a twofold Equa-
ble Motion, that is, Horizontal and Perpen-
dicular, the <I>Impetus</I> or Moment of the Lation
compounded of both the Motions $hall be <I>po-
tentia</I> equal to both the Moments of the fir$t
Motions.</P>
<P><I>For let any Moveable be moved Equably with a double Lation,
and let the Mutations of the Perpendicular an$wer to the Space
A B, and let B C an$wer to the Horizontal Lation pa$$ed in
the $ame Time. Fora$much therefore as the Spa-</I>
<fig>
<I>ces A B, and B C are pa$$ed by the Equable Mo-
tion in the $ame Time, their Moments $hall be to
cach other as the $aid A B and B C. But the
Moveable which is moved according to the$e two Mutations $hall de-</I>
<foot><I>$cribe</I></foot>
<p n=>217</p>
<I>$cribe the Diagonal A C, and its Moment $hall be as A C. But A C is</I>
potentia <I>equal to the $aid A B and B C: therefore the Moment com-
pounded of both the Moments A B and B C, is</I> potentia <I>equal to them
both taken together: Which was to be demon$trated.</I></P>
<P>SIMP. It is nece$$ary that you ea$e me of one Scruple that
cometh into my mind, it $eemeth to me that this which is now con-
cluded oppugneth another Propo$ition of the former Tractate: in
which it is affirmed, That the <I>Impetus</I> of the Moveable coming
from A into B is equal to that coming from A into C; and now it is
concluded, that the <I>Impetus</I> in C is greater than that in B.</P>
<P>SALV. The Propo$itions, <I>Simplicius,</I> are both true, but very
different from one another. Here the Author $peaks of one $ole
Moveable moved with one $ole Motion, but compounded of two,
both Equable; and there he $peaks of two Moveables moved
with Motions Naturally Accelerated, one along the Perpendicular
A B, and the other along the Inclined Plane A C: and moreover,
the Times there are not $uppo$ed equal, but the Time along
the Inclined Plane A C is greater than the Time along the Perpen-
dicular A B: but in the Motion $poken of at pre$ent, the Motions
along A B, B C and A C are under$tood to be Equable, and made
in the $ame Time.</P>
<P>SIMP. Excu$e me, and go on, for I am $atisfied.</P>
<P>SALV. The Author proceeds to $hew us that which hapneth
concerning the <I>Impetus</I> of a Moveable moved in like manner with
one Motion compounded of two, that is to $ay, the one Horizon-
tal and Equable, and the other Perpendicular but Naturally-Acce-
lerate, of which in fine the Motion of the Project is compounded,
and by which the Parabolick Line is de$cribed; in each point of
which the Author endeavours to determine what the <I>Impetus</I> of the
Project is; for under$tanding of which he $heweth us the manner,
or, if you will, Method of regulating and mea$uring that $ame <I>Im-
petus</I> upon the $aid Line, along which the Motion of the Grave
Moveable de$cending with a Natural-Accelerate Motion departing
from Re$t is made, $aying:</P>
<head>THEOR. III. PROP. III.</head>
<P><I>Let a Motion be made along the Line A B out of Re$t in A, and
take in $ome point C; and $uppo$e the $aid A C to be the Time or
Mea$ure of the Time of the $aid Fall along the Space A C, as al$o
the Mea$ure of the</I> Impetus <I>or Moment in the Point C acquired by
the De$cent along A C. Now let there be taken in the $aid Line
A B any other Point, as $uppo$e B, in which we are to determine of the</I>
Impetus <I>acquired by the Moveable along the Fall A B, in proportion to</I>
<foot>Ff <I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>218</p>
<I>the</I> Impetus, <I>which it obtaineth in C, who$e Mea$ure is $uppo$ed to be
A C, Let A S be a Mean-proportional betwixt B A and A C. We will
demon$trate that the</I> Impetus <I>in B is to the</I> Impetus <I>in C, as S A is to
A C. Let the Horizontal Line C D be double to the $aid A C; and B E
double to B A. It appeareth by what hath been demon$trated, That the
Cadent along A C being turned along the Horizon C D, and according
to the</I> Impetus <I>acquired in C, with an Equable Motion, $hall pa$s the
Space C D in a Time equal to that
in which the $aid A C is pa$$ed</I>
<fig>
<I>with an Accelerate Motion; and
likewi$e that B E is pa$$ed in the
$ame time as A B: But the Time of
the De$cent along A B is A S: There-
fore the Horizontal Line B E is
pa$$ed in A S. As the Time S A is
to the Time A C, $o let E B be to
B L. And becau$e the Motion by
B E is Equable, the Space B L $hall be pa$$ed in the Time A C ac-
cording to the Moment of Celerity in B: But in the $ame Time A C
the Space C D is pa$$ed, according to the Moment of Velocity in C:
the Moments of Velocity therefore are to one another as the Spaces
which according to the $ame Moments are pa$$ed in the $ame Time:
Therefore the Moment of Velocity in C is to the Moment of Celerity in
B, as D C is to B L. And becau$e as D C is to B E, $o are their halfs,
to wit, C A to A B: but as E B is to B L, $o is B A to A S: Therefore,</I>
ex&aelig;quali, <I>as D C is to B L, $o is C A to A S: that is, as the Moment
of Velocity in C is to the Moment of Velocity in B, $o is C A to A S; that
is, the Time along C A to the Time along A B. I he manner of Mea$u-
ring the</I> Impetus, <I>or the Moment of Velocity upon a Line along which it
makes a Motion of De$cent is therefore manife$t; which</I> Impetus
<I>is indeed $uppo$ed to encrea$e according to the Proportion of the
Time.</I></P>
<P><I>But this, before we proceed any farther, is to be premoni$hed, that in
regard we are to $peak for the future of the Motion compounded of the
Equable Horizontal, and of the Naturally Accelerate downwards, (for
from this Mixtion re$ults, and by it is de$igned the Line of the Project,
that is a Parabola;) it is nece$$ary that we define $ome common mea$ure
according to which we may mea$ure the Velocity,</I> Impetus, <I>or Moment
of both the Motions. And $eeing that of the Equable Motion the de-
grees of Velocity are innumerable, of which you may not take any
promi$cuou$ly, but one certain one which may be be compared and con-
joyned with the Degree of Velocity naturally Accelerate. I can think of
no more ea$ie way for the electing and determining of that, than by a$-
$uming another of the $ame kind. And that I may the better expre$s
my meaning; Let A C be Perpendicular to the Horizon C B; and A C</I>
<foot><I>to</I></foot>
<p n=>219</p>
<I>to be the Altitude, and C B the Amplitude of the Semiparabola A B;
which is de$cribed by the Compo$ition of two Lations; of which one is
that of the Moveable de$cending along A C with a Motion Naturally
Acceler ate</I> ex quiete <I>in A; the other is the Equable Tran$ver$al Moti-
on according to the Horizontal Line A D. The</I> Impetus <I>acquired in C
along the De$cent A C is determined by the quantity of the $aid height
A C; for the</I> Impetus <I>of a Moveable</I>
<fig>
<I>falling from the $ame height is alwaies
one and the $ame: but in the Horizontal
Line one may a$$ign not one, but innume-
rable Degrees of Velocities of Equable
Motions: out of which multitude that I
may $ingle out, and as it were point with
the finger to that which I make choice of,
I extend or prolong the Altitude C A</I> in
$ublimi, <I>in which, as was done before, I
will pitch upon A E; from which if I
conceive in my mind a Moveable to fall</I>
ex quiete <I>in E, it appeareth that its</I> Im-
petus <I>acquired in the Time A, is one with which I conceive the $ame
Moveable being turned along A D to be moved; and its degree of
Vclocity to be that, which in the Time of the De$cent along E A pa$$eth
a Space in the Horizon double to the $aid E A. This Pr&aelig;monition I
judged nece$$ary.</I></P>
<P><I>It is moreover to be advertized that the Amplitude of the Semi-
parabola A B $hall be called by me the Horizontal Line</I> [or Plane]
<I>C B.</I></P>
<P><I>The Altitude, to with A C, the Axis of the $aid Parabola.</I></P>
<P><I>And the Line E A, by who$e De$cent the Horizontal</I> Impetus <I>is de-
termined, I call the Sublimity, or height.</I></P>
<P><I>The$e things being declared and defined, I proceed to Demon$tra-
tion.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. Stay, I pray you, for here me thinks it is convenient to
adorn this Opinion of our Author with the conformity of it to
the Conceit of <I>Plato</I> about the determining the different Veloci-
ties of the Equable Motions of the Revolutions of the C&oelig;le$tial
Bodies; who, having perhaps had a conjecture that no Moveable
could pa$$e from Re$t into any determinate degree of Velocity in
which it ought afterwards to be perpetuated, unle$s by pa$$ing
thorow all the other le$$er degrees of Velocity, or, if you will,
greater degrees of Tardity, which interpo$e between the a$$igned
degree, and the highe$t degree of Tardity, that is of Re$t, $aid that
God after he had created the Moveable C&oelig;le$tial <I>B</I>odies that he
might a$$ign them tho$e Velocities wherewith they were afterwards
<foot>Ff 2 to</foot>
<p n=>220</p>
to be perpetually moved with an Equable Circular Motion, made
them, they departing from Re$t, to move along determinate Spaces
with that Natural Motion in a Right Line, according to which we
$en$ibly $ee our Moveables to move from the $tate of Re$t $ucce$-
$ively Accelerating. And he addeth, that having made them to
acquire that degree in which it plea$ed him that they $hould after-
wards be perpetually con$erved, he converted their Right or direct
Motion into Circular; which only is apt to con$erve it $elf Equa-
ble, alwaies revolving without receding from, or approaching to
any prefixed term by them de$ired. The Conceit is truly worthy
of <I>Plato</I>; and is the more to be e$teemed in that the grounds there-
of pa$$ed over in $ilence by him, and di$covered by our Author by
taking off the Mask or Poetick Repre$entation, do $hew it to be
in its native a$pect a true Hi$tory. And I think it very credible that
we having by the Doctrine of A$tronomy $ufficiently competent
Knowledge of the Magnitudes of the Orbes of the Planets, and of
their Di$tances from the Center about which they move, as al$o
of their Velocities, our Author (to whom <I>Plato's</I> Conjecture was
not unknown) may $ometime for his curio$ity have had $ome
thought of attempting to inve$tigate whether one might a$$ign a
determinate Sublimity from which the <I>B</I>odies of the Planets depar-
ting, as from a $tate of Re$t, and moved for certain Spaces with a
Right and Naturally Accelerate Motion, afterwards converting
the Acquired Velocity into Equable Motions, they might be found
to corre$pond with the greatne$s of their Orbes, and with the Times
of their Revolutions.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. I think I do remember that he hath heretofore told me,
that he had once made the Computation, and al$o that he found
it exactly to an$wer the Ob$ervations; but that he had no mind to
$peak of them, doubting le$t the two many Novelties by him di$-
covered, which had provoked the di$plea$ure of many again$t him,
might blow up new $parks. <I>B</I>ut if any one $hall have the like de-
$ire he may of him$elf by the Doctrine of the pre$ent Tract give
him$elf content. <I>B</I>ut let us pur$ue our bu$ine$s, which is to
$hew;</P>
<head>PROBL. I. PROP. IV.</head>
<P>How in a Parabola given, de$cribed by the Pro-
ject, the <I>Impetus</I> of each $everal point may be
determined.</P>
<P><I>Let the Semiparabola be B E C, who$e Amplitude is C D and Al-
titude D B, with which continued out on high the Tangent of the
Parabola C A meeteth in A; and along the</I> Vertex <I>B let B I be</I>
<foot><I>an</I></foot>
<p n=>221</p>
<I>an Horizontal Line, and parallel to C D. And if the Amplitude C D
be equal to the whole Altitude D A, B I $hall be equal to B A and B D.
And if the Time of the Fall along A B, and the Moment of Velocity
acquired in B along the De$cent A B</I> ex quiete <I>in A be $uppo$ed to be
mea$ured by the $aid A B, then D C (that is twice B I) $hall be the
Space which $hall be pa$$ed by the</I> Impetus A <I>B turned along the Hori-
zontal Line in the $ame Time: But in the $ame Time falling along B D
out of Re$t in B, it $hall pa$s the Altitude B D: Therefore the Movea-
ble falling out of Re$t in A along A B,
being converted with the</I> Impetus <I>A B</I>
<fig>
<I>along the Horizontal Parallel $hall
pa$s a Space equal to D C. And the
Fall along B D $upervening, it pa$$eth
the Altitude B D, and de$cribes the
Parabola B C; who$e</I> Impetus <I>in the
Term C is compounded of the Equable
Tran$ver$al who$e Moment is as A B,
and of another Moment acquired in the
Fall B D in the Term D or C; which
Moments are Equal. If therefore we
$uppo$e A B to be the Mea$ure of one of them, as $uppo$e of the Equa-
ble Tran$ver$al; and B I, which is equal to B D, to be the Mea$ure of
the</I> Impetus <I>acquired in D or C; then the Subten$e I A $hall be the
quantity of the Moment compound of them both: Therefore it $hall be
the quantity or Mea$ure of the whole Moment which the Project de$cend-
ing along the Parabola B C $hall acquire of</I> Impetus <I>in C. This pre-
mi$ed, take in the Parabola any point E, in which we are to determine
of the</I> Impetus <I>of the Project. Draw the Horizontal Parallel E F,
and let B G be a Mean-proportional between B D and B F. And fora$-
much as A B or B D is $uppo$ed to be the Mea$ure of the Time, and of
the Moment of the Velocity in the Fall B D</I> ex quiete <I>in B: B G $hall
be the Time, or the Mea$ure of the Time, and of the</I> Impetus <I>in F, coming
out of B. If therefore B O be $uppo$ed equal to B G, the Diagonal
drawn from A to O $hall be the quantity of the</I> Impetus <I>in E; for
A B hath been $uppo$ed the determinator of the Time, and of the</I> Impe-
tus <I>in B, which turned along the Horizontal Parallel doth alwaies
continue the $ame: And B O determineth the</I> Impetus <I>in F or in E
along the De$cent</I> ex quiete <I>in B in the Altitude B F: But the$e two
A B and B O are</I> potentia <I>equal to the Power A O. Therefore that is
manife$t which was $ought.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. The Contemplation of the Compo$ition of the$e diffe-
rent <I>Impetus's,</I> and of the quantity of that <I>Impetus</I> which re$ults
from this mixture, is $o new to me, that it leaveth my mind in no
$mall confu$ion. I do not $peak of the mixtion of two Motions
<foot>Equable,</foot>
<p n=>222</p>
Equable, though unequal to one another, made the one along the
Horizontal Line, and the other along the Perpendicular, for I very
well comprehend that there is made a Motion of the$e two <I>poten-
tia</I> equal to both the Compounding Motions, but my confu$ion
ari$eth upon the mixing of the Equable-Horizontal and Perpendi-
cular-Naturally-Accelerate Motion. Therefore I could wi$h we
might toge ther a little better con$ider this bu$ine$s.</P>
<P>SIMP. And I $tand the more in need thereof in that I am not
yet $o well $atisfied in Mind as I $hould be, in the Propo$itions that
are the fir$t foundations of the others that follow upon them. I
will add, that al$o in the Mixtion of the two Motions Equable
Horizontal, and Perpendicular, I would better under$tand that
<I>Potentia</I> of their Compound. Now, <I>Salviatus,</I> you $ee what we
want and de$ire.</P>
<P>SALV. Your de$ire is very rea$onable: and I will e$$ay whe-
ther my having had a longer time to think thereon may facilitate
your $atisfaction. But you mu$t bear with and excu$e me if in di$-
cour$ing I $hall repeat a great part of the things hitherto delivered
by our Author.</P>
<P>It is not po$$ible for us to $peak po$itively touching Motions and
their Velocities or <I>Impetus's,</I> be they Equable, or be they Naturally
Accelerate, unle$s we fir$t agree upon the Mea$ure that we are to
u$e in the commen$uration of tho$e Velocities, as al$o of the Time.
As to the Mea$ure of the Time, we have already that which is
commonly received by all of Hours, Prime-Minutes, and Se-
conds, <I>&amp;c.</I> and as for the mea$uring of Time we have that com-
mon Mea$ure received by all, $o it is requi$ite to a$$ign another
Mea$ure for the Velocities that is commonly under$tood and re-
ceived by every one; that is, which every where is the $ame. The
Author, as hath been declared, adjudged the Velocity of Naturally
de$cending Grave-Bodies to be fit for this purpo$e; the encrea$ing
Velocities of which are the $ame in all parts of the World. So that
that $ame degree of Velocity which (for example) a Ball of Lead of
a pound acquireth in having, departing from Re$t, de$cended Per-
pendicularly as much as the height of a Pike, is alwaies, and in all
places the $ame, and therefore mo$t commodious for explicating
the quantity of the <I>Impetus</I> that is derived from the Natural De-
$cent. Now it remains to find a way to determine likewi$e the
Quantity of the <I>Impetus</I> in an Equable Motion in $uch a manner,
that all tho$e which di$cour$e about it may form the $ame conceit
of its greatne$s and Velocity; $o that one may not imagine it more
$wift, and another le$s; whereupon afterwards in conjoyning and
mingling this Equable Motion imagined by them with the e$tabli-
$hed Accelerate Motion $everal men may form $everal Conceits of
$everal greatne$$es of <I>Impetus's.</I> To determine and repre$ent this
<foot><I>Impetus,</I></foot>
<p n=>223</p>
<I>Impetus,</I> and particular Velocity our Author hath not found any
way more commodious, than the making u$e of the <I>Impetus</I> which
the Moveable from time to time acquires in the Naturally-Accele-
rate Motion, any acquired Moment of which being reduced into
an Equable Motion retaineth its Velocity preci$ely limited, and
$uch, that in $uch another Time as that wherein it did De$cend, it
pa$$eth double the Space of the Height from whence it fell. But
becau$e this is the principal point in the bu$ine$s that we are upon,
it is good to make it to be perfectly under$tood by $ome particular
Example. Rea$$uming therefore the Velocity and <I>Impetus</I> acqui-
red by the Cadent Moveable, as we $aid before, from the height
of a Pike, of which Velocity we will make u$e for a Mea$ure of
other Velocities and <I>Impetu$$es</I> upon other occa$ions, and $uppo-
$ing, for example, that the Time of that Fall be four $econd Mi-
nutes of an hour, to find by this $ame Mea$ure how great the <I>Im-
petus</I> of the Moveable would be falling from any other height
greater, or le$$er, we ought not from the proportion that this other
height hath to the height of a Pike to argue and conclude the quan-
tity of the <I>Impetus</I> acquired in this $econd height, thinking, for
example, that the Moveable falling from quadruple the height
hath acquired quadruple Velocity, for that it is fal$e: for that the
Velocity of the Naturally-Accelerate Motion doth not increa$e or
decrea$e according to the proportion of the Spaces, but according
to that of the Times, than which that of the Spaces is greater in a
duplicate proportion, as was heretofore demon$trated. Therefore
when in a Right Line we have a$$igned a part for the Mea$ure of
the Velocity, and al$o of the Time, and of the Space in that Time
pa$$ed (for that for brevity $ake all the$e three Magnitudes are
often repre$ented by one $ole Line,) to find the quantity of the
Time, and the degree of Velocity that the $ame Moveable would
have acquired in another Di$tance we $hall obtain the $ame, not
immediataly by this $econd Di$tance, but by the Line which $hall
be a Mean-proportional betwixt the two Di$tances. But I will
better declare my $elf by an Example. In the Line A C Perpendi-
cular to the Horizon let the part A B be under$tood to
be a Space pa$$ed by a Moveable naturally de$cending
<fig>
with an Accelerate Motion: the Time of which pa$-
$age, in regard I may repre$ent it by any Line, I will, for
brevity, imagine it to be as much as the $ame Line A B
and likewi$e for a Mea$ure of the <I>Impetus</I> and Velocity
acquired by that Motion, I again take the $ame Line
A B; $o that of all the Spaces that are in the progre$s of
the Di$cour$e to be con$idered the part A B may be the
Mea$ure. Having all our plea$ure e$tabli$hed under one
$ole Magnitude A B the$e three Mea$ures of different kinds of
<foot>Quantities,</foot>
<p n=>224</p>
Quantities, that is to $ay, of Spaces, of Times, and of <I>Impetus's,</I> let
it be required to determine in the a$$igned Space, and at the height
A C, how much the Time of the Fall of the Moveable from A to
C is to be, and what the <I>Impetus</I> is that $hall be found to have been
acquired in the $aid Term C, in relation to the Time and to the
<I>Impetus</I> mea$ured by A B. Both the$e que$tions $hall be re$olved
taking A D the Mean-proportional betwixt the two Lines A C
and A B; affirming the Time of the Fall along the whole Space
A C to be as the Time A D is in relation to A B, a$$igned in the
beginning for the Quantity of the Time in the Fall A B. And like-
wi$e we will $ay that the <I>Impetus,</I> or degree of Velocity that the
Cadent Moveable $hall obtain in the Term C, in relation to the
<I>Impetus</I> that it had in B, is as the $ame Line A D is in relation to
A B, being that the Velocity encrea$eth with the $ame proportion
as the Time doth: Which Conclu$ion although it was a$$umed as
a <I>Po$tulatum,</I> yet the Author was plea$ed to explain the Applicati-
on thereof above in the third Propo$ition.</P>
<P>This point being well under$tood and proved, we come to the
Con$ideration of the <I>Impetus</I> derived from two compound Moti-
ons: whereof let one be compounded of the Horizontal and alwaies
Equable, and of the Perpendicular unto the Horizon, and it al$o
Equable: but let the other be compounded of the Horizontal like-
wi$e alwaies Equable, and of the Perpendicular Naturally-Accele-
rate. If both $hall be Equable, it hath been $een already that the
<I>Impetus</I> emerging from the compo$ition of both is <I>potentia</I> equal to
both, as for more plainne$s we will thus Exemplifie. Let the Move-
able de$cending along the Perpendicular A B be $uppo$ed to have,
for example, three degrees of Equable <I>Impetus,</I> but being tran$-
ported along A B towards C, let the $aid Velocity and <I>Impetus</I> be
$uppo$ed four degrees, $o that in the $ame Time that falling it would
pa$s along the Perpendicular, <I>v. gr.</I> three yards,
<fig>
it would in the Horizontal pa$s four, but in
that compounded of both the Velocities it
cometh in the $ame Timefrom the point A un-
to the Term C, de$cending all the way along the Diagonal Line
A C, which is not $even yards long, as that $hould be which is com-
pounded of the two Lines A B, 3, and B C, 4, but is 5; which 5 is
<I>potentia</I> equal to the two others, 3 and 4: For having found the
Squares of 3 and 4, which are 9 and 16, and joyning the$e together,
they make 25 for the Square of A C, which is equal to the two
Squares of A B and B C: whereupon A C $hall be as much as is the
Side, or, if you will, Root of the Square 25, which is 5. For a con$tant
and certain Rule therefore, when it is required to a$$ign the
Quantity of the <I>Impetus</I> re$ulting from two <I>Impetus's</I> given, the
one Horizontal, and the other Perpendicular, and both Equable,
<foot>they</foot>
<p n=>225</p>
they are each of them to be $quared, and their Squares being put
together the Root of the Aggregate is to be extracted, which $hall
give us the quantity of the <I>Impetus</I> compounded of them both.
And thus in the foregoing example, that Moveable that by vertue
of the Perpendicular Motion would have percu$$ed upon the Hori-
zon with three degrees of Force, and with only the Horizontal Mo-
tion would have percu$$ed in C with four degrees, percu$$ing with
both the <I>Impetus's</I> conjoyned, the blow $hall be like to that of the
Percutient moved with five degrees of Velocity and Force. And
this $ame Percu$$ion would be of the $ame Impetuo$ity in all the
points of the Diagonal A C, for that the compounded <I>Impetus's</I>
are alwaies the $ame, never encrea$ing or dimini$hing.</P>
<P>Let us now $ee what befalls in compounding the Equable Hori-
zontal Motion with another Perpendicular to the Horizon which
beginning from Re$t goeth Naturally Accelerating. It is already
manife$t, that the Diagonal, which is the Line of the Motion com-
pounded of the$e two, is not a Right Line, but Semiparabolical,
as hath been demon$trated; ^{*} in which the <I>Impetus</I> doth go con-
<marg>* Or along
which.</marg>
tinually encrea$ing by means of the continual encrea$e of the Ve-
locity of the Perpendicular Motion: Wherefore, to determine what
the <I>Impetus</I> is in an a$$igned point of that Parabolical Diagonal, it
is requi$ite fir$t to a$$ign the Quantity of the Uniform Horizontal
<I>Impetus,</I> and then to find what is the <I>Impetus</I> of the falling Movea-
ble in the point a$$igned: the which cannot be determined without
the con$ideration of the Time $pent from the beginning of the
Compo$ition of the two Motions: which Con$ideration of the
Time is not required in the Compo$ition of Equable Motions, the
Velocities and <I>Impetus's</I> of which are alwaies the $ame: but here
where there is in$erted into the mixture a Motion which beginning
from extream Tardity goeth encrea$ing in Velocity according to
the continuation of the Time, it is nece$$ary that the quantity of
the Time do $hew us the quantity of the degree of Velocity in the
a$$igned point: for, as to the re$t, the <I>Impetus</I> compounded of the$e
two (as in Uniform Motions) is <I>potentia</I> equal to both the others
compounding. But here again I will better explain my meaning by
an example. In A C the Perpendicular to the Horizon let any part
be taken A B; the which I will $uppo$e to $tand for the Mea$ure
of the Space of the Natural Motion made along the $aid Perpen-
dicular, and likewi$e let it be the Mea$ure of the Time, and al$o of
the degree of Velocity, or, if you will, of the <I>Impetus's.</I> It is ma-
nife$t in the fir$t place, that if the <I>Impetus</I> of the Moveable in B
<I>ex quiete</I> in A $hall be turned along B D parallel to the Horizon in
an Equable Motion, the quantity of its Velocity $hall be $uch that
in the Time A B it $hall pa$s a Space double to the Space A B, which
let be the Line B D. Then let B C be $uppo$ed equal to B A, and
<foot>Gg let</foot>
<p n=>226</p>
let C E be drawn parallel and equal to B D, and thus by the Points
B and E we $hall de$cribe the Parabolick Line B E I. And becau$e
that in the Time A B with the <I>Impetus</I> A B the Horizontal Line B D
or C E is pa$$ed, double to A B, and in $uch another Time the Per-
pendicular B C is pa$$ed with an acqui$t of <I>Impetus</I> in C equal to
the $aid Horizontal Line; therefore the Moveable in $uch another
Time as A B $hall be found to have pa$$ed from B to E along the
Parabola B E with an <I>Impetus</I> compounded of two, each equal to
the <I>Impetus</I> A B. And becau$e one of them is Horizontal, and the
other Perpendicular, the <I>Impetus</I> compound of them $hall be equal
in Power to them both, that is
<fig>
double to one of them. So that
$uppo$ing B F equal to B A, and
drawing the Diagonal A F, the
<I>Impetus</I> or the Percu$$ion in E
$hall be greater than the Percu$-
$ion in B of the Moveable fal-
ling from the Height A, or than
the Percu$$ion of the Horizon-
tal <I>Impetus</I> along B D, according
to the proportion of A F to
A B. But in ca$e, $till retaining
B A for the Mea$ure of the
Space of the Fall from Re$t in
A unto B, and for the Mea$ure of the Time and of the <I>Impetus</I> of
the falling Moveable acquired in B, the Altitude B O $hould not be
equal to, but greater than A B, taking B G to be a Mean-propor-
tional betwixt the $aid A B and B O, the $aid B G would be the
Mea$ure of the Time and of the <I>Impetus</I> in O, acquired in O by the
Fall from the height B O; and the Space along the Horizontal
Line, which being pa$$ed with the <I>Impetus</I> A B in the Time A B
would be double to A B, $hall, in the whole duration of the Time
B G, be $o much the greater, by how much in proportion B G is
greater than B A. Suppo$ing therefore L B equal to B G, and draw-
ing the Diagonal A L, it $hall give us the quantity compounded of
the two <I>Impetus's</I> Horizontal and Perpendicular, by which the
Parabola is de$cribed; and of which the Horizontal and Equable is
that acquired in B by the fall of A B, and the other is that acquired
in O, or, if you will, in I by the De$cent B O, who$e Time, as al$o
the quantity of its Moment was B G. And in this Method we $hall
inve$tigate the <I>Impetus</I> in the extream term of the Parabola, in ca$e
its Altitude were le$$er than the Sublimity A B, taking the Mean-
proportional betwixt them both: which being $et off upon the Ho-
rizontal Line in the place of B F, and the Diagonal drawn, as A F,
we $hall hereby have the quantity of the <I>Impetus</I> in the extream
term of the Parabola.</P>
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>227</p>
<P>And to what hath hitherto been propo$ed touching <I>Impetus's,</I>
Blows, or if you plea$e, Percu$$ions of $uch like Projects, it is ne-
ce$$ary to add another very nece$$ary Con$ideration; and this it is:
That it doth not $uffice to have regard to the Velocity only of the
Project for the determining rightly of the Force and Violence of the
Percu$$ion, but it is requi$ite likewi$e to examine apart the State
and Condition of that which receiveth the Percu$$ion, in the effica-
cy of which it hath for many re$pects a great $hare and intere$t.
And fir$t there is no man but knows that the thing $mitten doth $o
much $uffer violence from the Velocity of the Percutient by how
much it oppo$eth it, and either totally or partially checketh its
Motion: For if the Blow $hall light upon $uch an one as yieldeth to
the Velocity of the Percutient without any Re$i$tance, that Blow
$hall be nullified: And he that runneth to hit his Enemy with his
Launce, if at the overtaking of him it $hall fall out that he moveth,
giving back with the like Velocity, he $hall make no thru$t, and the
Action $hall be a meer touch without doing any harm.</P>
<P>But if the Percu$$ion $hall happen to be received upon an Object
which doth not wholly yield to the Percutient, but only partially,
the Percu$$ion $hall do hurt, though not with its whole <I>Impetus,</I> but
only with the exce$s of the Velocity of the $aid Percutient above
the Velocity of the recoile and rece$$ion of the Object percu$$ed:
$o that, if <I>v. g.</I> the Percutient $hall come with 10 degrees of Velo-
city upon the Percu$$ed Body, which giving back in part retireth
with 4 degrees, the <I>Impetus</I> and Percu$$ion $hall be as if it were of
6 degrees. And la$tly, the Percu$$ion $hall be entire and perfect on
the part of the Percutient when the thing percu$$ed yieldeth not,
but wholly oppo$eth and $toppeth the whole Motion of the Percu-
tient; if haply there can be $uch a ca$e. And I $ay on the part of
the Percutient, for when the Body percu$$ed moveth with a contra-
ry Motion towards the Percutient, the Blow and Shock $hall be
$o much the more Impetuous by how much the two Velocities uni-
ted are greater than the $ole Velocity of the Percutient. More-
over, you are likewi$e to take notice, that the more or le$s yielding
may proceed not only from the quality of the Matter more or le$s
hard, as if it be of Iron, of Lead, or of Wooll, <I>&amp;c.</I> but al$o from
the Po$ition of the Body that receiveth the Percu$$ion. Which Po-
$ition if it $hall be $uch as that the Motion of the Percutient hap-
neth to hit it at Right-Angles, the <I>Impetus</I> of the Percu$$ion $hall
be the greate$t: but if the Motion $hall proceed obliquely, and, as
we $ay, a$lant, the Percu$$ion $hall be weaker; and that more, and
more according to its greater and greater Obliquity: for an Ob-
ject in that manner $cituate, albeit of very $olid matter, doth not
damp or arre$t the whole <I>Impetus</I> and Motion of the Percutient,
which $lanting pa$$eth farther, continuing at lea$t in $ome part to
<foot>Gg 2 move</foot>
<p n=>228</p>
move along the Surface of the oppo$ed Body Re$i$ting. When
therefore we have even now determined of the greatne$s of the
<I>Impetus</I> of the Project in the end of the Parabolicall Line, it ought
to be under$tood to be meant of the Percu$$ion received upon a
Line at Right Angles with the $ame Parabolick Line, or with the
Line that is Tangent to the Parabola in the fore$aid point: for
although that $ame Motion be compounded of an Horizontal and
a Perpendicular Motion, the <I>Impetus</I> is not at the greate$t either
upon the Horizontal Plane, or upon that erect to the Horizon, be-
ing received upon them both obliquely.</P>
<P>SAGR. Your $peaking of the$e Blows, and the$e Percu$$ions
hath brought into my mind a Problem, or, if you will, Que$tion
in the Mechanicks, the $olution whereof I could never find in any
Author, nor any thing that doth dimini$h my admiration, or $o
much as in the lea$t afford my judgment $atisfaction. And my
doubt and wonder lyeth in my not being able to comprehend
whence that Immen$e Force and Violence $hould proceed, and on
what Principle it $hould depend, which we $ee to con$i$t in Per-
cu$$ion, in that with the $imple $troke of an Hammer, that doth
not weigh above eight or ten pounds, we $ee $uch Re$i$tances to be
overcome as would not yield to the weight of a Grave Body that
without Percu$$ion hath an <I>Impetus</I> only by pre$$ing and bearing
upon it, albeit the weight of this be many hundreds of pounds
more. I would likewi$e find out a way to mea$ure the Force of this
Percu$$ion, which I do not think to be infinite, but rather hold
that it hath its Term in which it may be compared, and in the end
Regulated with other Forces of pre$$ing Gravities, either of Lea-
vers, or of Screws, or of other Mechanick In$truments, of who$e
multiplication of Force I am thorowly $atisfied.</P>
<P>SALV. You are not alone in the admirablene$s of the effect,
and the ob$curity of the cau$e of $o $tupendious an Accident. I
ruminated a long time upon it in vain, my $tupifaction $till encrea-
$ing; till in the end meeting with our <I>Academian,</I> I received from
him a double $atisfaction: fir$t in hearing that he al$o had been a
long time at the $ame lo$s; and next in under$tanding that after he
had at times $pent many thou$ands of hours in $tudying and con-
templating thereon, he had light upon certain Notions far from
our fir$t conceptions, and therefore new, and for their Novelty to
be admired. And becau$e that I already $ee that your Curio$ity
would gladly hear tho$e Conceits which are Remote from common
Conjecture, I $hall not $tay for your entreaty, but I give you my
word that $o $oon as we $hall have fini$hed the Reading of this
Treati$e of Projects, I will $et before you all tho$e Fancies, or, I
might $ay, Extravagancies that are yet left in my memory of the
Di$cour$es of the Academick. In the mean time let us pro$ecute
the Propo$itions of our Author.</P>

<P>In the Axis of a given Parabola prolonged to find
a $ublime point out of which the Moveable
falling $hall de$cribe the $aid Parabola.</P>
<P><I>Let the Parabola be A B, its Amplitude H B, and its prolonged
Axis H E; in which a Sublimity is to be found, out of which the
Moveable falling, and converting the</I> Impetus <I>conceived in A
along the Horizontal Line, de$cribeth the Parabola A B. Draw the
Horizontal Line A G, which $hall be Parallel to B H, and $uppo$ing A F
equal to A H draw the Right Line F B, which toucheth the Parabola in
B, and cutteth the Horizontal Line A G in G; and unto F A and A G
let A E be a third Proportional. I $ay, that E is the $ublime Point re-
quired, out of which the Moveable falling</I> ex quiete <I>in E, and the</I> Im-
petus <I>conceived in A being converted along the Horizontal Line over-
taking the</I> Impetus <I>of the De$cent</I>
<fig>
<I>in H</I> ex quiete <I>in A, de$cribeth the
Parabola A B. For if we $uppo$e
E A to be the Mea$ure of the Time
of the Fall from E to A, and of
the</I> Impetus <I>acquired in A, A G
(that is a Mean-proportional be-
tween E A and A F) $hall be the
Time and the</I> Impetus <I>coming
from F to A, or from A to H. And
becau$e the Moveable coming out of
E in the Time E A with the</I> Impetus <I>acquired in A pa$$eth in the Ho-
rizontal Lation with an Equable Motion the double of E A; There-
fore likewi$e moving with the $ame</I> Impetus <I>it $hall in the Time A G
pa$s the double of G A, to wit, the Mean-proportional B H (for the
Spaces pa$$ed with the $ame Equable Motion are to one another as the
Times of the $aid Motions:) And along the Perpendicular A H $hall
be pa$$ed with a Motion</I> ex quiete <I>in the $ame Time G A: Therefore
the Amplitude H B, and Altitude A H are pa$$ed by the Moveable in the
$ame Time: Therefore the Parabola A B $hall be de$cribed by the
De$cent of the Project coming from the Sublimity E: Which was re-
quired.</I></P>
<head>COROLLARY.</head>
<P>Hence it appeareth that the half of the <I>B</I>a$e or Amplitude of the
Semiparabola (which is the fourth part of the Amplitude of
the whole Parabola) is a Mean-proportional betwixt its Al-
titude and the Sublimity out of which the Moveable falling
de$cribeth it.</P>

<P>In Projects which de$cribe Semiparabola's of the

in that which de$cribeth that who$e Ampli-

other.</P>
<P><I>For let the Semiparabola be B D, who$e Amplitude C D is dou-
ble to its Altitude C B; and in its Axis extended on high let B A
be $uppo$ed equal to the Altitude B C; and draw a Line from
A to D which toucheth the Semiparabola in D, and $hall cut the Hori-
zontal Line B E in E; and B E $hall be equal to B C or to B A: It is
manife$t that it is de$cribed by the Project who$e Equable Horizontal</I>
Impetus <I>is $uch as is that gained in B of a thing falling from Re$t in A,
and the</I> Impetus <I>of the Natural Motion downwards, $uch as is that of
a thing coming to C</I> ex quiete <I>in B. Whence it is manife$t, that the</I>
Impetus <I>compounded of them, and that $triketh in the Term D is as the
Diagonal A E, that is</I> potentia <I>equal to them both. Now let there be
another Semiparabola G D, who$e Amplitude is the $ame C D, and the
Altitude C G le$s, or greater than the Altitude B C, and let H D touch
the $ame, cutting the Horizontal Line drawn by G in the point K; and
as H G is to G K, $o let K G be to G L: by what hath been demon$trated
G L $hall be the Altitude from which the Project falling de$cribeth the</I>
<foot><I>Parabola</I></foot>
<p n=>231</p>
<I>Parabola G D. Let G M be a Mean-proportional betwixt A B and
G L; G M $hall be the Time, and the Moment or</I> Impetus <I>in G of the
Project falling from L, (for it hath been $uppo$ed that A B is the Mea-
$ure of the Time and</I> Impetus.) <I>Again, let G N be a Mean-propor-
tional betwixt B C and C G: this G N $hall be the Mea$ure of the
Time and the</I>
Impetus <I>of the</I>
<fig>

If therefore a

from M to N
it $hall be the
the Mea$ure of
the</I> Impetus <I>of

long the Para-

king in the
term D. Which</I>
Impetus, <I>I $ay,
is greater than the</I> Impetus <I>of the Project along the Parabola B D,
who$e quantity was A E. For becau$e G N is $uppo$ed the Mean-pro-
portional betwixt B C and C G, and B C is equal to B E, that is to H G;
(for they are each of them $ubduple to D C:) Therefore as C G is to
G N, $o $hall N G be to G K: and, as C G or H G is to G K, $o $hall the
Square N G be to the Square of G K: But as H G is to G K, $o was
K G $uppo$ed to be to G L: Therefore as N G is to the Square G K, $o
is K G to G L: But as K G is to G L, $o is the Square K G unto the
Square G M, (for G M is the Mean between K G and G L:) Therefore
the three Squares N G, K G, and G M are continual proportionals: And
the two extream ones N G and G M taken together, that is the Square
M N is greater than double the Square K G, to which the Square A E
is double: Therefore the Square M N is greater than the Square A E:
and the Line M N greater than the Line A E: Which was to be de-
mon$trated.</I></P>

<P>Hence it appeareth, that on the contrary, in the Project out of D
along the Semiparabola D B, le$s <I>Impetus</I> is required than
along any other according to the greater or le$$er Elevation

$o the Angle M B C $hall be Semi-right; and prolonging C M
to D, let there be con$tituted in B two equal Angles above and below
the Diagonal M B,</I> viz. <I>M B E, and M B D. It is to be demon$trated

ing emitted</I> [or $hot off] <I>with the $ame</I> Impetus <I>out of the Term B,
according to the Elevations of the Angles E B C and D B C, are equal.
For in regard that the extern Angle B M C, is equal to the two intern
M D B and M B D, the Angle M B C $hall al$o be equal to them. And if
we $uppo$e M B E in$tead of the Angle M B D,
the $aid Angle M B C $hall be equal to the two</I>
<fig>
<I>Angles M B E and B D C: And taking away
the common Angle M B E, the remaining An-

and B C E are alike. Let the Right Lines
D C and E C be divided in the mid$t in H and

let I H be to H L: the Triangle I H L $hall be

that I H and G F are equal (to wit, halves of the $ame B C:) There-
fore F E, that is F C, $hall be equal to H L: And, adding the common
Line F H, C H $hall be equal to F L. If therefore we under$tand the Se-
miparabola to be de$cribed along by H and B, who$e Altitude $hall be
H C, and Sublimity H L, its Amplitude $hall be C B, which is double
to HI, that is, the Mean betwixt D H, or C H, and HL: And D B
$hall be a Tangent to it, the Lines C H and H D being equal. And if,
again, we conceive the Parabola to be de$cribed along by F and B from
the Sublimity FL, with the Altitude F C, betwixt which the Mean-
proportional is F G, who$e double is the Horizontal Line C B: C B, as
before, $hall be its Amplitude; and E B a Tangent to it, $ince E F and
F C are equal: But the Angles D B C and E B C</I> ($cilicet, <I>their Eleva-

<P>The <I>Impetus</I> and Amplitude of a Semiparabola be-
ing given, to find its Altitude, and con$equently
its Sublimity.</P>
<P><I>Let the</I> Impetus <I>given be defined by the Perpendicular to the Ho-
rizon A B; and let the Amplitude along the Horizontal Line be
B C. It is required to find the Altitude and Sublimity of the
Parabola who$e</I> Impetus <I>is A B, and Amplitude B C. It is manife$t,
from what hath been already demon$trated, that half the Amplitude B C
will be a Mean-proportional betwixt the Altitude and the Sublimity of
the $aid Semiparabola, who$e</I> Impetus, <I>by the precedent Propo$ition, is
the $ame with the</I> Impetus <I>of the Moveable falling from Re$t in A along
the whole Perpendicular A B: Wherefore B A is $o to be cut that the
Rectangle contained by its parts may be equal to the Square of half of
B C, which let be B D. Hence it appeareth
to be nece$$ary that D B do not exceed the</I>
<fig>
<I>half of B A; for of Rectangles contained by
the parts the greate$t is when the whole
Line is cut into two equal parts. Therefore
let B A be divided into two equal parts in E.
And if B D be equal to B E the work is
done; and the Altitude of the Semipara-
bola $hall be B E, and its Sublimity E A:
(and $ee here by the way that the Amplitude
of the Parabola of a Semi-right Elevation,
as was demon$trated above, is the greate$t of
all tho$e de$cribed with the $ame</I> Impetus.)
<I>But let B D be le$s than the half of B A,
which is $o to be cut that the Rectangle under the parts may be equal to
the Square B D. Upon E A de$cribe a Semicircle, upon which out of A
$et off A F equal to B D, and draw a Line from F to E, to which cut
a part equal E G. Now the Rectangle B G A, together with the Square
E G, $hall be equal to the Square E A; to which the two Squares A F
and F E are al$o equal: Therefore the equal Squares G E and F E be-
ing $ub$tracted, there remaineth the Rectangle B G A equal to the
Square A F,</I> $cilicet, <I>to B D; and the Line B D is a Mean-proportional
betwixt B G and G A. Whence it appeareth, that of the Semipa-
rabola who$e Amplitude is B C, and</I> Impetus <I>A B, the Altitude is
B G, and the Sublimity G A. And if we $et off B I below equal to G A,
this $hall be the Altitude, and I A the Sublimity of the Semiparabola
I C. From what hath been already demon$trated we are able,</I></P>

<P>To collect by Calculation of the Amplitudes of all
Semiparabola's that are de$cribed by Projects
expul$ed with the $ame <I>Impetus,</I> and to make
Tables thereof.</P>
<P><I>It is obvious, from the things demon$trated, that Parabola's are de-
$cribed by Projects of the $ame</I> Impetus <I>then, when their Subli-
mities together with their Altitudes do make up equal Perpendicu-
lars upon the Horizon. The$e Perpendiculars therefore are to be com-
prehended between the $ame Horizontal Parallels. Therefore let the
Horizontal Line C B be $uppo$ed equal to the Perpendicular B A, and
draw the Diagonal from A to C. The Angle A C B $hall be Semi-
right, or 45 Degrees. And the Perpendicular B A being divided into
two equal parts in D, the Semiparabola D C $hall be that which is de-
$cribed from the Sublimity A D together with the Altitude D B: and
its</I> Impetus <I>in C $hall be as great as that of the Moveable coming out of
Re$t in A along the Perpendicular A B is in B. And if A G be drawn
parallel to B C, the united Altitudes and Sublimities of all other re-
maining Semiparabola's who$e future</I> Impetus's <I>are the $ame with tho$e
now mentioned mu$t be bounded by the Space between the Parallels</I>
<fig>
<I>A G and B C. Farthermore, it having
been but now demon$trated, that the Am-
plitudes of the Semiparabola's who$e
Tangents are equidi$tant either above or
below from the Semi right Elevation are
equal, the Calculations that we frame
for the greater Elevations will likewi$e
$erve for the le$$er. We choo$e moreover
a number of ten thou$and parts for the
greate$t Amplitude of the Projection of
the Semiparabola made at the Elevation
of 45 degrees: $o much therefore the Line
B A, and the Amplitude of the Semipa-
rabola B C, are to be $uppo$ed. And we
make choice of the number 10000, becau$e we in our Calculation u$e
the Table of Tangents, in which this number agreeth with the Tangent
of 45 degrees. Now, to come to the bu$ine$s, let C E be drawn, contain-
ing the Angle E C B greater (Acute neverthele$s,) than the Angle
A C B; and let the Semiparabola be de$cribed which is touched by the
Line E C, and who$e Sublimity united with its Altitude is equal to
B A. In the Table of Tangents take the $aid B E for the Tangent at the</I>
<foot><I>given</I></foot>
<p n=>238</p>
<I>given Angle B C E, which divide into two equal parts at F. Then
find a third Proportional to B F and B C, (or to the half of B C,)
which $hall of nece$$ity be greater than F A; therefore let it be F O:
Of the Semiparabola, therefore, in$cribed in the Triangle E C B, ac-
cording to the Tangent C E, who$e Amplitude is C B, the Altitude B F,
and the Sublimity F O is found: But the whole Line B O ri$eth above
the Parallels A G and C B, whereas our work was to bound it between
them: For $o both it and the Semiparabola D C $hall be de$cribed by
the Projects out of C expelled with the $ame</I> Impetus. <I>Therefore we
are to $eek another like to this, (for innumerable greater and $maller,
like to one another, may be de$cribed within the Angle B C E) to who$e
united Sublimity and Altitude B A $hall be equal. Therefore as O B is
to B A, $o let the Amplitude B C be to C R: and C R $hall be found,</I>
$cilicet <I>the Amplitude of the Semiparabola according to the Elevation
of the Angle B C E, who$e conjoyned Sublimity and Altitude is equal
to the Space contained between the Parallels G A and C B: Which
was required. The work, therefore, $hall be after this manner.</I></P>
<P><I>Take the Tangent of the given Angle B C E, to the half of which
add the third Proportional of it, and half of B C, which let be F O:
Then as O B is to B A, $o let B C be to another, which let be C R, to wit,
the Amplitude $ought. Let us give an Example.</I></P>
<P><I>Let the Angle E C B be 50 degrees, its Tangent $hall be 11918,
who$e half, to wit, B F, is 5959, and the half of B C is 5000, the third
proportional of the$e halves is 4195, which added to the $aid B F
maketh 10154: for the $aid B O. Again, as O B is to B A, that is as
10154 is to 10000, $o is B E, that is 10000 (for each of them is the
Tangent of 45 degrees) to another: and that $hall give us the required
Altitude R C 9848, of $uch as B C (the greate$t Amplitude) is
10000. To the$e the Amplitudes of the whole Parabola's are double,</I>
$cilicet <I>19696 and 20000. And $o much likewi$e is the Amplitude of
the Parabola according to the Elevation of 40 degrees, $ince it is equal-
ly di$tant from 45 degrees.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. For the perfect under$tanding of this Demon$tration I
mu$t be informed how true it is, that the Third Proportional to
B F and B I, is (as the Author $aith) nece$$arily greater than
F A.</P>
<P>SALV. That inference, as I conceive, may be deduced thus.
The Square of the Mean of three proportional Lines is equal to
the Rectangle of the other two: whence the Square of B I, or of
B D equal to it, ought to be equal to the Rectangle of the fir$t F B
multiplied into the third to be found: which third is of nece$$ity to
be greater than F A, becau$e the Rectangle of B F multiplied into
F A is le$s than the Square B D: and the Defect is as much as the
Square of D F, as <I>Euclid</I> demon$trates in a Propo$ition of his
<foot>Second</foot>
<p n=>239</p>
Second Book. You mu$t al$o know, that the point F which divi-
deth the Tangent E B in the middle, will many other times fall
above the point A, and once al$o in the $aid A: In which ca$es it is
evident of it $elf, that the third proportional to the half of the Tan-
gent, and to B I (which giveth the Sublimity) is all above A. But
the Author hath taken a Ca$e in which it was not manife$t that the
$aid third Proportional is alwaies greater than F A: and which
therefore being $et off above the point F pa$$eth beyond the Paral-
lel A G. Now let us proceed.</P>
<P><I>It will not be unprofitable if by help of this Table we compo$e ano-
ther, $hewing the Altitudes of the $ame Semiparabola's of Projects of

<P>From the given Amplitudes of Semiparabola's in
the following Table $et down, keeping the
common <I>Impeius</I> with which every one of
them is de$cribed, to compute the Altitudes of
each $everal Semiparabola.</P>
<P><I>Let the Amplitude given be B C, and of the</I> Impetus, <I>which is
$uppo$ed to be alwaies the $ame, let the Mea$ure be O B, to wit,
the Aggregate of the Altitude and Sublimity. The $aid Altitude
is required to be found and di$tingui$hed. Which $hall then be done when
B O is $o divided as that the Rectangle contained under its parts is
equal to the Square of half the Amplitude B C. Let that $ame divi-
$ion fall in F; and let both O B and B C be cut in the mid$t at D and I.</I>
<fig>
<I>The Square I B, therefore, is equal to the
Rectangle B F O: And the Square D O is
equal to the $ame Rectangle together with the
Square F D. If therefore from the Square
D O we deduct the Square B I, which is equal
to the Rectangle B F O, there $hall remain
the Square F D; to who$e Side D F, B D be-
ing added it $hall give the de$ired Altitude
Altitude B F. And it is thus compounded</I>
ex datis. <I>From half of the Square B O known
$ub$tract the Square B I al$o known, of the remainder take the Square
Root, to which add D B known; and you $hall have the Altitude $ought
B F. For example. The Altitude of the Parabola de$cribed at the
Elevation of 55 degrees is to be found. The Amplitude, by the follow-
ing Table is 9396, its half is 4698, the Square of that is 22071204,</I>
<foot><I>this</I></foot>
<p n=>240</p>
<I>this $ub$tracted from the Square of the half B O, which is alwaies
the $ame, to wit, 2500000, the remainder is 2928796, who$e Square
Root is 1710 very near, this added to the half of B O, to wit, 5000,
gives 67101, and $o much is the Altitude B F. It will not be unprofi-
table, to give the Third Table, containing the Altitudes and Sublimi-
ties of Semiparabola's, who$e Amplitude $hall be alwaies the $ame.</I></P>

know the Difference of the <I>Impetus's,</I> and of the Forces that are
required for carrying the Project to the $ame Di$tance with Ranges
which are called at Random: which Difference I believe is very
great according to the different Elevations [<I>or Mountures:</I>] $o that
if, for example, one would at the Elevation of 3 or 4 degrees, or of
87 or 88 make the Ball to fall where it did, being $hot at the Ele-
vation of <I>gr.</I> 45. (where, as hath been $hewn, the lea$t <I>Impetus</I> is
required) I believe that it would require a very much greater
Force.</P>

full execution in all the Elevations it is requi$ite to make great Pro-
gre$$ions towards an infinite <I>Impetus.</I> Now let us $ee the Con$tru-

<head>PROBL. VII. PROP. XIV.</head>
<P>To find the Altitudes and Sublimities of Semipa-
rabola's who$e Amplitudes $hall be equal for
each degree of Elevation.</P>
<P><I>This we $hall ea$ily do. For $uppo$ing the Amplitude of the Semi-
par abola to be of 10000 parts, the half of the Tangent of each
degree of Elevation $hews the Altitude. As for example, of the
Semiparabola who$e Elevation is 30 degrees, and Amplitude, as is
$uppo$ed, 10000 parts, the Altitude $hall be 2887, for $o much, very
near, is the half of the Tangent. And having found the Altitude the
Sublimity is to be known in this manner. For a$much as it hath been
demon$trated that the half of the Amplitude of a Semiparabola is the
Mean proportional betwixt the Altitude and Sublimity, and the Alti-
tude being already found, and the half of the Amplitude being alwaies
the $ame, to wit, 5000 parts, if we $hall divide the Square thereof by
the Altitude found, the de$ired Sublimity $hall come forth. As in the
Example: The Altitude found was 2887; The Square of the 5000
parts is 25000000; which being divided by 2887, giveth 8659, ve-
ry near, for the Sublimity $ought.</I></P>
<P>SALV. Now here we $ee, in the $ir$t place, that the Conje-
cture is very true which was mentioned afore, that in different
Elevations the farther one goeth from the middlemo$t, whether it
be in the Higher, or in the Lower, $o much greater <I>Impetus</I> and Vio-
lence is required to carry the Project to the $ame Di$tance. For the
<I>Impetus</I> lying in the mixture of the two Motions, Equable, Hori-
zontal, and Perpendicular Naturally-Accelerate, of which <I>Impetus</I>
the Aggregate of the Altitude and Sublimity is the Mea$ure, we do
$ee in the propounded Table that that $ame Aggregate is lea$t in
the Elevation of <I>gr.</I> 45, in which the Altitude and Sublimity are
equal, <I>$cilicet</I> each 5000, and their Aggregate 10000. But if we
$hould look on any greater Elevation, as, for example, of <I>gr.</I> 50, we
$hould $ind the Altitude to be 5959, and the Sublimity 4196, which
added together make 10155. And $o much al$o we $hould find the
<I>Impetus</I> of <I>gr.</I> 40 to be, this and that Elevation being equally re-
mote from the middlemo$t. Where we are to note, in the $econd
place, that it is true, That equal <I>Impetus's</I> are $ought by two, and
two in the Elevations equidi$tant from the middlemo$t, with this
pretty variation over and above that the Altitudes and the Subli-
mities of the ^{*} $uperiour Elevations an$wer alternally to the Sub-
<marg>* <I>i.e.</I> Tho$e above
45 deg.</marg>
limities and Altitudes of the Inferiour: $o that whereas in the
<foot>example</foot>
<p n=>243</p>
example propo$ed, in the Elevation of <I>gr.</I> 50. the Altitude is 5959
and the Sublimity 4196, in the Elevation of <I>gr.</I> 40. it falls out on
the contrary that the Altitude is 4196, and the Sublimity 5959:
And the $ame happens in all others without any difference; $ave
only that for the avoyding of tediou$ne$s in Calculations we have
kept no account of $ome fractions, which in $o great $ums are of no
value, but may without any prejudice be omitted.</P>
<P>SAGR. I am ob$erving that of the two <I>Impetus's</I> Horizontal and
Perpendicular in Projections, the more Sublime they are, they need
$o much the le$s of the Horizontal, and the more of the Perpendi-
cular. Moreover in tho$e of $mall Elevation, great mu$t be the
Force of the Horizontal <I>Impetus,</I> which is to carry the Project in a
little Altitude. But although I comprehend very well that in the
Total Elevation of <I>gr.</I> 90, all the force in the world $ufficeth not
to drive the Project one $ingle Inch from the Perpendicular, but
that it mu$t of nece$$ity fall in the $ame place whence it was expel-
led; yet dare I not with the like certainty affirm that likewi$e in the
nullity of Elevation, that is in the Horizontal Line, the Project
cannot by any Force le$s than infinite, be driven to any di-
$tance: So, as that, for example, a Culverin it $elf $hould not be
able to carry a Ball of Iron Horizontally, or, as they $ay, at Point
blank, that is at no point, which is when it hath no Elevation. I
$ay, in this ca$e I $tand in $ome doubt; and that I do not re$olute-
ly deny the thing, the rea$on depends on another Accident which
$eems no le$s $trange, and yet I have a very nece$$ary Demon$trati-
on for it. And the Accident is this, the Impo$$ibility of di$tending
a Rope, $o, as that it may be $tretched right out, and parallel to the
Horizon, but that it alwaies $wayes and bendeth, nor is there any
Force that can $tretch it otherwi$e.</P>
<P>SALV. So then, <I>Sagredus,</I> your wonder cea$eth in this ca$e of
the Rope becau$e you have the Demon$tration of it. But if we
$hall well con$ider the matter, it may be we $hall find $ome corre-
$pondence between the Accident of the Project and this of the
Rope. The Curvity of the Line of the Horizontal Projection $eem-
eth to be derived from two Forces, of which one, (which is that of
the Projicient) driveth it Horizontally, and the other, (which
is the Gravity of the Project) draweth it downwards Perpendicu-
larly. Now $o in the $tretching of the Rope, there are the Forces
of tho$e that pull it Horizontally, and there is al$o the weight of
the Rope it $elf, which naturally inclineth it downwards. The$e
two effects are very much alike in the generation of them. And if
you allow the weight of the Rope $o much $trength and power as to
be able to oppo$e and overcome any whatever Immen$e Force, that
would di$tend it right out, why will you deny the like to the weight
of the Bullet? But be$ides, I $hall tell you, and at once procure your
<foot>Ii 2 wonder</foot>
<p n=>244</p>
wonder, and delight, that the Rope thus tentered, and $tretcht little
or much, doth $hape it $elf into Lines that come very near to Para-
bolical, and the re$emblance is $o great, that if you draw a Para-
bolical Line upon a plain Superficies that is erect unto the Horizon,
and holding it rever$ed, that is with the Vertex downwards and
with the Ba$e Parallel to the Horizon, you cau$e a Chain to be held
pendent, and $u$tained at the extreams of the Ba$e of the De$cribed
Parabola, you $hall $ee the $aid Chain, as you $laken it more or le$s,
to incurvate and apply it $elf to the $ame Parabola, and this $ame
Application $hall be $o much the more exact, when the de$cribed
Parabola is le$s curved, that is more di$tended: So that in Parabola's
de$cribed with Elevations under <I>gr.</I> 45, the Chain an$wereth the
Parabola almo$t to an hair.</P>
<P>SAGR. It $eems then that with $uch a Chain wrought into $mall
Links one might in an in$tant trace out many Parabolick Lines up-
on a plain Superficies.</P>
<P>SALV. One might, and that al$o with no $mall commodity, as I
$hall tell you anon.</P>
<P>SIMP. But before you pa$s any farther, I al$o would gladly be
a$certained at lea$t in that Propo$ition of which you $ay there is a
very nece$$ary Demon$tration, I mean that of the Impo$$ibility of
di$tending a Rope, by any whatever immen$e Force, right out and
equidi$tant from the Horizon.</P>
<P>SAGR. I will $ee if I remember the Demon$tration, for under-
$tanding of which it is nece$$ary, <I>Simplicius,</I> that you $uppo$e for
true, that which in all Mechanick In$truments is confirmed, not on-
ly by Experience, but al$o by Demon$tration: and this it is, That
the Velocity of the Mover, though its Force be very $mall, may
overcome the Re$i$tance, though very great, of a Re$i$ter, which
mu$t be moved $lowly when ever the Velocity of the Mover hath
greater proportion to the Tardity of the Re$i$ter, than the Re$i-
$tance of that which is to be moved hath to the Force of the Mo-
ver.</P>
<P>SIMP. This I know very well, and it is demon$trated by <I>Ari-
$totle</I> in his Mechanical Que$tions, and is manife$tly $een in the Lea-
ver and in the Stiliard, in which the Roman which weigheth not
above 4 pounds, will lift up a weight of 400 in ca$e the di$tance of
the $aid Roman from the Center on which the Beam turneth be
more than an hundred times greater than the di$tance of that point
at which the great weight hangeth from the $ame Center: and this
cometh to pa$s becau$e in the de$cent which the Roman maketh
pa$$eth a Space above an hundred times greater than the Space
which the great weight mounteth in the $ame Time: Which is all
one as to $ay, that the little Roman moveth with a Velocity above
an hundred times greater than the Velocity of the great Weight.</P>
<foot>SAGR.</foot>
<p n=>245</p>
<P>SAGR. You argue very well, and make no $eruple at all of
granting, that be the Force of the Mover never $o $mall it $hall $u-
perate any what ever great Re$i$tance at all times when that $hall
more exceed in Velocity than this doth in Force and Gravity.
Now come we to the ca$e of the Rope. And drawing a $mall
Scheme be plea$ed to under$tand for once that this Line A B, re$t-
ing upon the two fixed and $tanding points A and B, to have hang-
ing at its ends, as you $ee, two immen$e Weights C and D, which
drawing it with great Force make it to $tand directly di$tended, it
being a $imple Line without any gravity. And here I proceed, and
tell you, that if at the mid$t of that which is the point E, you $hould
hang any never $o little a Weight, as is this H, the Line A B would
yield, and inclining towards the point F, and by con$equence
lengthening, will con$train the two great Weights C and D to
a$cend upwards: which I demon$trate to you in this manner:
About the two points A and B as Centers I de$cribe two Quadrants
E F G, and E L M, and in regard that the two Semidiameters AI
and B L are equal to the two Semidiameters A E and E B, the exce$-
$es F I and F L $hall be the quantity of the prolongations of the
parts A F and F B, above A E and E B; and of con$equence $hall
<fig>
determine the A$cents
of the Weights C and
D, in ca$e that the
Weight H had had a
power to de$cend to F:
which might then be
in ca$e the Line E F,
which is the quantity
of the De$cent of the
$aid Weight H, had
greater proportion to
the Line F I which de-
termineth the A$cent of
the two Weights C &amp;
D, than the pondero-
$ity of both tho$e Weights hath to the pondero$ity of the Weight
H. But this will nece$$arily happen, be the pondero$ity of the
Weights C and D never $o great, and that of H never $o $mall; for
the exce$s of the Weights C and D above the Weight His not $o
great, but that the exce$s of the Tangent E F above the part of the
Secant F I may bear a greater proportion. Which we will prove
thus: Let there be a Circle who$e Diameter is G A I; and look
what proportion the pondero$ity of the Weights C and D have to
the pondero$ity of H, let the Line B O have the $ame proportion to
another, which let be C, than which let D be le$$er: So that B O
<foot>$hall</foot>
<p n=>246</p>
$hall have greater proportion to D, than to C. Unto O B and D
take a third proportional B E; and as O E is to E B, $o let the Dia-
meter G I (prolonging it) be to I F: and from the Term F
draw the Tangent F N. And becau$e it hath been pre$uppo$ed,
that as O E is to E B, $o is G I to I F: therefore, by Compo$ition, as
O B is to B E, $o is G F to F I: But betwixt O B and B E the Mean-
proportional is D; and betwixt G F and F I the Mean-proporti-
onal is N F: Therefore N F hath the $ame proportion to F I that
O B hath to D: which proportion is greater than that of the
Weights C and D to the Weight H. Therefore, the De$cent or
Velocity of the Weight H having greater proportion to the A$cent
or Velocity of the Weights C and D, than the pondero$ity of the
$aid Weights C and D hath to the pondero$ity of the Weight H:
It is manife$t, that the Weight H $hall de$cend, that is, that the
Line A B $hall depart from Horizontal Rectitude. And that which
befalleth the right Line A B deprived of Gravity in ca$e any $mall
Weight H cometh to be hanged at the $ame in E, happens al$o to
the $aid Rope A B, $uppo$ed to be of ponderous Matter, without
the addition of any other Grave Body; for that the Weight of
the Matter it $elf compounding the $aid Rope AB is $u$pended
thereat.</P>
<P>SIMP. You have fully $atisfied me; therefore <I>Salviatus</I> may ac-
cording to his promi$e declare unto us, what the Commodity is that
may be drawn from $uch like Chains, and after that relate unto us
tho$e Speculations which have been made by our <I>Accademian</I>
touching the Force of Percu$$ion.</P>
<P><I>S</I>ALV. We are for this day $ufficiently employed in the Con-
templations already delivered, and the Time, which is pretty late,
would not be enough to carry us through the matters you mention;
therefore we $hall defer our Conference till $ome more convenient
time.</P>
<P>SAGR. I concur with you in opinion, for that by $undry di$-
cour$es that I have had with the Friends of our <I>Academick</I> I have
learnt that this Argument of the Force of Percu$$ion is very ob-
$cure, nor hath hitherto any one that hath treated thereof penetra-
ted its intricacies, full of darkne$s, and altogether remote from

heard of, one runs in my mind that is very extravagant and odde,
namely, That the Force of Percu$$ion is Interminate, if not Infi-
nite. We will therefore attend the lea$ure of <I>Salviatus.</I> But for
the pre$ent, tell me what things are tho$e which are written at the
end of the Treati$e of Projects?</P>
<P>SALV. The$e are certain Propo$itions touching the Center of
Gravity of Solids, which our <I>Academick</I> found out in his youth,
<marg>* <I>Fredericus Co-

conceiving that what ^{*} <I>Frederico Comandino</I> had writ touching the
<foot>$ame</foot>
<p n=>247</p>
$ame was not altogether without Imper$ection. He therefore
thought that with the$e Propo$itions, which here you $ee written,
he might $upply that which is wanting in the Book of <I>Comandine</I>;
and he applyed him$elf to the $ame at the In$tance of the mo$t
Illu$trious Lord Marque$s <I>Guid' Vbaldo dal Monte,</I> the mo$t ex-
cellent Mathematician of his Time, as his $everal Printed Works
do $peak him; and gave a Copy thereof to that Noble Lord with
thoughts to have pur$ued the $ame Argument in other Solids not
mentioned by <I>Comandine:</I> But he chanced after $ome Time to
meet with the ^{*} Book of <I>Signore Luca Valerio,</I> a mo$t famous
<marg>* <I>De.</I></marg>
Geometrician, and $aw that he re$olveth all the$e matters with-
out omi$$ion of any thing, he proceeded no farther, although his
Agre$$ions were by methods very different from the$e of <I>Signore
Valerio.</I></P>
<P>SAGR. It would be a favour, therefore, if, for this time, which
interpo$eth between this and our next Meeting, you would plea$e
to leave the Book in my hands: for I $hall all the while be read-

that you will take plea$ure in the$e Propo$itions.</P>

<P>If certain Magnitudes at any Rate equally exceed-
ing one another, and who$e exce$s is equal to
the lea$t of them, be $o di$po$ed in the Balance,
as that they hang at equal di$tances, to divide
the Center of Gravity of the whole Balance
$o, that the part towards the le$$er Magnitudes
be double to the remainder.</P>
<P><I>In the ^{*} Ballance A B, therefore, let there be $u$pended at equal di-</I>
<marg>* Or Beam.</marg>
<I>$tances any number of Magnitudes, as hath been $aid, F, G, H, K,
N; of which let the lea$t be N, and let the points of the Su$pen$ions
be A, C, D, E, B, and let the Center of Gravity of all the Magnitudes
$o di$po$ed be X. It is to be proved that the part of the Ballance B X
towards the le$$er Magnitudes is double to the remaining part X A.</I></P>
<P><I>Let the Ballance be divided in two equal parts in D, for it mu$t ei-
ther fall in $ome point of the Su$pen$ions, or el$e in the middle point be-
tween two of the points of the Su$pen$ions: and let the remaining di-
$tances of the Su$pen$ions which fall between A and D, be all divided
into halves by the Points M and I; and let all the Magnitudes be divi-</I>
<fig>
<I>ded into parts equal to
N: Now the parts of F
$hall be $o many in num-
ber, as tho$e Magnitudes
be which are $u$pended
at the Ballance, and the
parts of G one fewer,
and $o of the re$t. Let
the parts of F therefore be N, O, R, S, T, and let tho$e of G be N, O,
R, S, tho$e of H al$o N, O, R, then let tho$e of K be N, O: and all the
Magnitudes in which are N $hall be equal to F; and all the Magnitudes
in which are O $hall be equal to G; and all the Magnitudes in which
are R $hall be equal to H; and tho$e in which S $hall be equal to K; and
the Magnitude T is equal to N. Becau$e therefore all the Magnitudes
in which are N are equal to one another, they $hall equiponderate in
the point D, which divideth the Ballance into two equal parts; and for
the $ame cau$e all the Magnitudes in which are O do equiponderate in
I; and tho$e in which are R in C; and in which are S in M do equi-
ponderate; and T is $u$pended in A. Therefore in the Ballance A D at
the equal di$tances D, I, C, M, A, there are Magnitudes $u$pended ex-
ceeding one another equally, and who$e exce$s is equal to the lea$t: and
the greate$t, which is compounded of all the N N hangeth at D, the</I>
<foot>Kk <I>lea$t</I></foot>
<p n=>250</p>
<I>lea$t which is T hangeth at A; and the re$t are ordinately di$po$ed.
And again there is another Ballance A B in which other Magnitudes
equal in number and Magnitude to the former are di$po$ed in the $ame
order. Wherefore the Ballances A B and A D are divided by the Cen-
ter of all the Magnitudes according to the $ame proportion: But the
Center of Gravity of the afore$aid Magnitudes is X: Wherefore X
divideth the Ballances B A and A D according to the $ame proportion;
$o that as B X is to X A, $o is X A to X D: Wherefore B X is double
to X A, by the Lemma aforegoing: Which was to be proved.</I></P>
<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P>If in a Parabolical Conoid Figure be de$cribed,
and another circum$cribed by Cylinders of
equal Altitude; and the Axis of the $aid Co-
noid be divided in $uch proportion that the
part towards the Vertex be double to that to-
wards the Ba$e; the Center of Gravity of the
in$cribed Figure of the Ba$e portion $hall be
neare$t to the $aid point of divi$ion; and the
Center of Gravity of the circum$cribed from
the Ba$e of the Conoid $hall be more remote:
and the di$tance of either of tho$e Centers
from that $ame point $hall be equal to the Line
that is the $ixth part of the Altitude of one of
the Cylinders of which the Figures are com-
po$ed.</P>
<P><I>Take therefore a Parabolical Conoid, and the Figures that have
been mentioned: let one of them be in$cribed, the other circum-
$cribed; and let the Axis of the Conoid, which let be A E, be di-
vided in N, in $uch proportion as that A N be double to N E. It is to
be proved that the Center of Gravity of the in$cribed Figure is in the
Line N E, but the Center of the circum$cribed in the Line A N. Let
the Plane of the Figures $o di$po$ed be cut through the Axis, and let
the Section be that of the Parabola B A C: and let the Section of the
cutting Plane, and of the Ba$e of the Conoid be the Line B C; and
let the Sections of the Cylinders be the Rectangular Figures; as ap-
peareth in the de$cription. Fir$t, therefore, the Cylinder of the in$cri-
bed who$e Axis is D E, hath the $ame proportion to the Cylinder who$e
Axis is D Y, as the Quadrate I D hath to the Quadrate S Y; that is,
as D A hath to A Y: and the Cylinder who$e Axis is D Y is</I> potentia
<foot><I>to</I></foot>
<p n=>251</p>
<I>to the Cylinder Y Z as S Y to R Z, that is, as Y A to A Z: and, by the
$ame rea$on, the Cylinder who$e Axis is Z Y is to that who$e Axis is
Z V, as Z A is to A V. The $aid Cylinders, therefore, are to one ano-
ther as the Lines D A, A Y; Z A, A V: But the$e are equally exceed-
ing to one another, and the exce$s is equal to the lea$t, $o that A Z is
double to A V; and A Y is triple the</I>
<fig>
<I>$ame; and D A Quadruple. Tho$e
Cylinders, therefore, are certain Mag-
nitudes in order equally exceeding one
another, who$e exce$s is equal to the
lea$t of them, and is the Line X M,
in which they are $u$pended at equal
di$tances (for that each of the Cy-
linders hath its Center of Gravity in
the mia$t of the Axis.) Wherefore,
by what hath been above demon$tra-
ted, the Center of Gravity of the Mag-
nitude compounded of them all divi-
deth the Line X M $o, that the part
towards X is double to the re$t. Divide it, therefore, and, let X</I> <G>a</G> <I>be
double</I> <G>a</G> <I>M: therefore is</I> <G>a</G> <I>the Center of Gravity of the in$cribed Fi-
gure. Divide A V in two equal parts in</I> <G>e</G>: <G>e</G> <I>X $hall be double to
M E: But X</I> <G>a</G> <I>is double to</I> <G>a</G> <I>M: Wherefore</I> <G>e</G> <I>E $hall be triple E</I> <G>a.</G> <I>But</I>
<G>a</G> <I>E is triple E N: It is manife$t, therefore, that E N is greater than
E X; and for that cau$e</I> <G>a,</G> <I>which is the Center of Gravity of the in-
$cribed Figure, cometh nearer to the Ba$e of the Conoid than N. And
becau$e that as A E is to E N, $o is the part taken away</I> <G>e</G> <I>E to the part
taken away E</I> <G>a</G>: <I>and the remaining part $hall be to the remaming part,
that is, A</I> <G>e</G> <I>to N</I> <G>a,</G> <I>as A E to E N. Therefore</I> <G>a</G> <I>N is the third part of
A</I> <G>e,</G> <I>and the $ixt part of A V. And in the $ame manner the Cylinders of
the circum$cribed Figure may be demon$trated to be equally exceeding
one another, and the exce$s to me equal to the least; and that they have
their Centers of Gravity at equal di$tances in the Line</I> <G>e</G> <I>M. If therefore</I>
<G>e</G> <I>M be divided in</I> <G>p,</G> <I>$o as that</I> <G>e p</G> <I>be double to the remaining part</I> <G>p</G> <I>M;</I>
<G>p</G> <I>$hall be the Center of Gravity of the whole circum$cribed Magnitude.
And $ince</I> <G>e p</G> <I>is double to</I> <G>p</G> <I>M; and A</I> <G>e</G> <I>le$s than double EM: (for
that they are equal:) the whole A E $hall be le$s than triple E</I> <G>p</G><I>: Where-
fore E</I> <G>p</G> <I>$hall be greater than E N. And, $ince</I> <G>e</G> <I>M is triple to M</I> <G>p,</G>
<I>and M E with twice</I> <G>e</G> <I>A is likewi$e triple to M E: the whole A E with
A</I> <G>e</G> <I>$hall be triple to E</I> <G>p</G><I>: But A E is triple to E N: Wherefore the
remaining part A</I> <G>e</G> <I>$hall be triple to the remaining part</I> <G>p</G> <I>N. Therefore
N</I> <G>p</G> <I>is the $ixth part of A V. And the$e are the things that were to be
demon$trated.</I></P>

<P>Hence it is manife$t, that a Conoid may be in$cribed in a Para-
bolical Figure, and another circum$cribed, $o, as that the
Centers of their Gravities may be di$tant from the point N
le$s than any Line given.</P>
<P><I>For if we a$$ume a Line $excuple of the propo$ed Line, and make the
Axis of the Cylinders, of which the Figures are compounded given
le$$er than this a$$umed Line, there $hall fall Lines between the Centers
of Gravities of the$e Figures and the mark N that are le$s than the
Line propo$ed.</I></P>
<P>The former Propo$ition another way.</P>
<P><I>Let the Axis of the Conoid (which let be C D) be divided in
O, $o, as that C O be double to O D. It is to be proved that the
Center of Gravity of the in$cribed Figure is in the Line O D;
and the Center of the circum$cribed in C O. Let the Plane of the Fi-
gures be cut through the Axis and C, as hath been $aid. Becau$e there-
fore the Cylinders S N, T M, V I,</I>
<fig>
<I>X E are to one another as the Squares
of the Lines S D, T N, V M, X I;
and the$e are to one another as the
Lines N C, C M, C I, C E: but
the$e do exceed one another equally;
and the exce$s is equal to the lea$t, to
wit, C E: And the Cylinder T M is
equal to the Cylinder Q N; and the
Cylinder V I equal to P N; and X E
is equal to L N: Therefore the Cylin-
ders S N, Q N, P N, and L N do
equally exceed one another, and the
exce$s is equal to the lea$t of them,
namely, to the Cylinder L N. But
the exce$s of the Cylinder S N, above
the Cylinder Q N is a Ring who$e
height is Q T; that is, N D; and
its breadth S Q. And the exce$s of the Cylinder Q N above P N, is a
Ring, who$e breadth is Q P. And the exce$s of the Cylinder P N above
L N is a Ring, who$e breadth is P L. Wherefore the $aid Rings S Q,
Q P, P L, are equal to another, and to the Cylinder L N. Therefore the
Ring S T equalleth the Cylinder X E: the Ring Q V, which is double
to S T, equalleth the Cylinder V I; which likewi$e is double to the</I>
<foot><I>Cylinder</I></foot>
<p n=>253</p>
<I>Cylinder X E: and for the $ame cau$e the Ring P X is equal to the
Cylinder T M; and the Cylinder L E $hall be equal to the Cylinder S N.
In the Beam or Ballance, therefore, K F connecting the middle points of
the Right-lines E I and D N, and cut into equal parts in the points H
and G, are certain Magnitudes $u$pended, to wit the Cylinders S N,
T M, V I, X E; and the Center of Gravity of the fir$t Cylinder is K;
and of the $econd H; of the third G; of the fourth F. And we have
another Ballance M K, which is the half of the $aid F K, and a like
number of points di$tributed into equal parts, to wit, M H, H N, N K,
and on it other Magnitudes, equal in number and bigne$s to tho$e which
are on the Beam F K, and having the Centers of Gravity in the points
M, H, N, and K, and di$po$ed in the $ame order. For the Cylinder L E
hath its Center of Gravity in M; and is equal to the Cylinder S N that
hath its Center in K: And the Ring P X hath the Center H; and is
equal to the Cylinder T M, who$e Center is H: And the Ring Q V ha-
ving the Center N is equal to the V I who$e Center is G: And la$tly,
the Ring S T having the Center K, is equal to the Cylinder X E who$e
Center is F. Therefore the Center of Gravity of the $aid Magnitudes
divideth the Beam in the $ame proportion: But the Center of them is
one, and therefore $ome point common to both the Beams or Ballance,
which let be Y. Therefore F Y and Y K $hall be as K Y and Y M. F Y
therefore is double to Y K: and C E being divided into two equal parts
in Z, Z F, $hall be double to K D: and for that cau$e Z D triple to D Y:
But to the Right Line D O C D is triple: Therefore the Right Line
D O is greater than D Y: And for the like cau$e Y the Center of the
in$cribed Figure approacheth nearer the Ba$e than the point O. And
becau$e as C D is to D O, $o is the part taken away Z D to the part ta-
ken away D Y; the remaining part C Z $hall be to the remaining part
Y O, as C D is to D O; that is Y O $hall be the third part of C Z;
that is, the $ixth part of C E. Again we will, by the $ame rea$on, de-
mon$trate the Cylinders of the circum$cribed Figure to exceed one ano-
ther equally, and that the exce$s is equal to the lea$t, and that their
Centers of Gravity are con$tituted in equal di$tances upon the Beam
K Z: and likewi$e that the Rings equal to tho$e $ame Cylinders are in
like manner di$po$ed on another Beam K G, the half of the $aid K Z,
and that therefore the Center of Gravity of the circum$cribed Figure,
which let be R, $o divideth the Beam, as that Z R is to R K, as K R is to
R G. Therefore Z R $hall be double to R K: But C Z is equal to the
Right Line K D, and not double to it. The whole C D $hall be le$$er
than triple to D R: Wherefore the Right Line D R is greater than D O;
that is to $ay, the Center of the circum$cribed Figure recedeth from the
Ba$e more than the point O. And becau$e Z K is triple to K R; and
K D with twice Z C is triple to K D; the whole C D with C Z $hall be
triple to D R: But C D is triple to D O: Wherefore the remaining
part C Z $hall be triple to the remaining part R O; that is, O R</I>

<P>The Center of Gravity of the Parabolick
Conoid doth $o divide the Axis, as that the
part towards the Vertex is double to the re-
maining part towards the Ba$e.</P>
<P><I>Let there be a Parabolick Conoid who$e Axis let be A B divided in
N $o as that A N be double to N B. It is to be proved that the Cen-
ter of Gravity of the Conoid is the point N. For if it be not N, it
$hall be either above or below it. Fir$t let it be below; and let it be X:
And $et off upon $ome place by it $elf the Line L O equal to N X; and let
L O be divided at plea$ure in S: and look what proportion B X and
O S both together have to O S, and the $ame $hall the Conoid have to
the Solid R. And in the Conoid let Figures be de$cribed by Cylinders
having equal Altitudes, $o, as that that which lyeth between the Center
of Gravity and the point N be le$s than L S: and let the exce$s of the
Conoid above it be le$s than the Solid R: and that this may be done is
clear. Take therefore the in$cribed, who$e Center of Gravity let be I:
now I X $hall be greater than S O: And becau$e that as X B with S O
is to S O, $o is the Conoid to the Solid R: (and R is greater than the
exce$s by which the Conoid exceeds the in$cribed Figure:) the proporti-
on of the Conoid to the $aid exce$s $hall be greater than both B X and
O S unto S O: And, by Divi$ion, the in$cribed Figure $hall have grea-
ter proportion to the $aid exce$s than B X to S O: But B X hath to
X I a proportion yet le$s than to S O: Therefore the in$cribed Figure
$hall have much greater proportion to the re$t of the proportions than
B X to X I: Therefore what proportion the in$cribed Figure hath to
there$t of the portions, the $ame $hall a certain other Line have to X I:
which $hall nece$$arily be greater than B X: Let it, therefore, be M X.
We have therefore the Center of Gravity of the Conoid X: But the
Center of Gravity of the Figure in$cribed in it is I: of the re$t of the
portions by which the Conoid exceeds the in$cribed Figure the Center of
Gravity $hall be in the Line X M, and in it that point in which it $hall
be $o terminated, that look what proportion the in$cribed Figure hath
to the exce$s by which the Conoid exceeds it, the $ame it $hall have to
X I: But it hath been proved, that this proportion is that which M X
hath to X I: Therefore M $hall be the Center of Gravity of tho$e pro-
portions by which the Conoid exceeds the in$cribed Figure: Which
certainly cannot be. For if along by M a Plane be drawn equidi$tant to
the Ba$e of the Conoid, all tho$e proportions $hall be towards one and</I>
<foot><I>the</I></foot>
<p n=>255</p>
<I>the $ame part, and not by it divided. Therefore the Center of Gravity
of the $aid Conoid is not below the point N: Neither is it above. For,
if it may, let it be H: and again, as before, $et the Line L O by it $elf
equalto the $aid H N, and divided at plea$ure in S: and the $ame pro-
portion that B N and S O both together have to S L, let the Conoid
have to R: and about the Conoid let a Figure be circum$cribed con$i-
$ting of Cylinders, as hath been $aid: by which let it be exceeded a le$s
quantity than that of the Solid R: and let the Line betwixt the Center
of Gravity of the circum$cribed Figure and the point N be le$$er than
S O: the remainder V H $hall be greater than S L. And becau$e that as
both B N and O S is to SL, $o is the</I>
<fig>
<I>Conoid to R: (and R is greater
than the exce$s by which the circum-
$cribed Figure exceeds the Conoid:)
Therefore B N and S O hath le$s pro-
portion to S L than the Conoid to the
$aid exce$s. And B V is le$$er than
both B N and S O; and V H is grea-
ter than S L: much greater proporti-
on, therefore, hath the Conoid to the
$aid proportions, than B V hath to
V H. Therefore whatever proporti-
on the Conoid hath to the $aid pro-
portions, the $ame $hall a Line greater
than B V have to V H. Let the $ame be M V: And becau$e the Center
of Gravity of the circum$cribed Figure is V, and the Center of the
Conoid is H. and $ince that as the Conoid to the re$t of the proportions,
$ois M V to V H, M $hall be the Center of Gravity of the remaining
proportions: which likewi$e is impo$$ible: Therefore the Center of
Gravity of the Conoid is not above the point N: But it hath been de-
mon$trated that neither is it beneath: It remains, therefore, that it ne-
ce$$arily be in the point N it $elf. And the $ame might be demon$trated
of Conoidal Plane cut upon an Axis not erect. The $ame in other terms,
as appears by what followeth:</I></P>
<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P>The Center of Gravity of the Parabolick Co-
noid falleth betwixt the Center of the cir-
cum$cribed Figure and the Center of the in-
$cribed.</P>
<foot><I>Let</I></foot>
<p n=>256</p>
<P><I>Let there be a Conoid who$e Axis is A B, and the Center of the
circum$cribed Figure C, and the Center of the in$cribed O. I $ay
the Center of the Conoid is betwixt the points C and O. For if
not, it $hall be either above them, or below them, or in one of them. Let
it be below, as in R. And becau$e R is the Center of Gravity of the
whole Conoid; and the Center of Gravity of the in$cribed Figure is O:
Therefore of the remaining proportions by which the Conoid exceeds
the in$cribed Figure the Center of Gravity $hall be in the Line O R ex-
tended towards R, and in that point in which it is $o determined, that,
what proportion the $aid proportions have to the in$cribed Figure, the
$ame $hall O R have to the Line falling betwixt R and that falling point.
Let this proportion be that of O R to R X. Therefore X falleth either
without the Conoid or within, or in its</I>
<fig>
<I>Ba$e. That it falleth without, or in its
Ba$e it is already manife$t to be an ab$ur-
dity. Let it fall within: and becau$e X R
is to R O, as the in$cribed Figure is to
the exce$s by which the Conoid exceeds
it; the $ame proportion that B R hath to
R O, the $ame let the in$cribed Figure
have to the Solid K: Which nece$$arily
$hall be le$$er than the $aid exce$s. And let
another Figure be in$cribed which may be
exceeded by the Conoid a le$s quantity
than is K, who$e Center of Gravity falleth betwixt O and C. Let it
be V. And, becau$e the fir$t Figure is to K as B R to R O, and the $e-
cond Figure, who$e Center V is greater than the fir$t, and exceeded
by the Conoid a le$s quantity than is K; what proportion the $econd
Figure hath to the exce$s by which the Conoid exceeds it, the $ame
$hall a Line greater than B R have to R V. But R is the Center of Gra-
vity of the Conoid; and the Center of the $econd in$cribed Figure V:
The Center therefore of the remaining proportions $hall be without
the Conoid beneath B: Which is impo$$ible. And by the $ame means
we might demon$trate the Center of Gravity of the $aid Conoid not to
be in the Line C A. And that it is none of the points betwixt C and
O is manife$t. For $ay, that there other Figures de$cribed, greater
$omething than the in$cribed Figure who$e Center is O, and le$s than
that circum$cribed Figure who$e Center is C, the Center of the Conoid
would fall without the Center of the$e Figures: Which but now was
concluded to be impo$$ible: It re$ts therefore that it be betwixt the Cen-
ter of the circum$cribed and in$cribed Figure. And if $o, it $hall ne-
ce$$arily be in that point which divideth the Axis, $o as that the part
towards the Vertex is double to the remainder; $ince N may circum-
$cribe and in$cribe Figures, $o, that tho$e Lines which fall between</I>
<foot><I>their</I></foot>
<p n=>257</p>
<I>their Centers and the $aid points, may be le$$er than any other Lines.

<P><I>Let A B, B C, and B F, be three proportional Lines; and what

$o is the compound of triple N S and S X
both together to the compound of N S and S X: Therefore, as E B is to
B I, $o is the compound of triple N S and triple S X to the compound of

<P><I>Take therefore a Cone, who$e Axis is N M. Let it be divided

Circum$cribed is likewi$e in the Axis N M, and nearer to the Vertex
than is S. Let a Figure therefore be $uppo$ed to be in$cribed by the Cy-
linders who$e Axis M C, C B, B E, E A are equal. Fir$t therefore
the Cylinder who$e Axis is M C hath</I>
<fig>
<I>to the Cylinder who$e Axis is C B the
$ame proportion as its Ba$e hath to
the Ba$e of the other (for their Alti-
tudes are equal.) But this propor-
tion is the $ame with that which the
Square C N hath to the Square N B.
And $o we might prove, that the Cy-
linder who$e Axis is C B hath to the
Cylinder who$e Axis is B E the $ame
proportion, as the Square B N hath to
the Square N E: and the Cylinder
who$e Axis is B E hath to the Cylin-
der who$e Axis is E A the $ame pro-
portion that the Square E N hath to
the Square N A. But the Lines N C,
N B, E N, and N A equally exceed one
another, and their exce$s equalleth the
lea$t, that is N A. Therefore they are certain Magnitudes, to wit, in-
$cribed Cylinders having con$equently to one another the $ame proporti-
on as the Squares of Lines that equally exceed one another, and the ex-</I>
<foot><I>ce$s</I></foot>

<I>ce$s of which is equal to the lea$t: and they are $o di$po$ed on the Beam
T I that their $everal Centers of Gravity con$i$t in it, and that at equal
di$tances. Therefore by the things above demon$trated it appeareth that
the Center of Gravity of all $o compo$ed Magnitudes do $o divide the
Balance T I, that the part to wards T is more than triple to the remain-
der. Let this Center be O. T O therefore is more than triple to O I.
But T N is triple to I M. Therefore the whole M O will be le$s than a
fourth part of the whole M N, who$e fourth part was $uppo$ed to be
M S. It is manife$t, therefore, that the point O doth nearer approach
the Ba$e of the Cone than S. And let the circum$cribed Figure be com-
po$ed of the Cylinders who$e Axis M C, C B, B E, E A and A N are

another as the Squares of the Lines M N, N C, B N, N E, A N,
which equally exceed one another, and the exce$s is equal to the lea$t
A N. Wherefore, by the premi$es, the Center of Gravity of all the Cy-
linders $o di$po$ed, which let be V, doth $o divide the Beam R I, that the
part towards R, to wit R V, is more than triple to the remaining part
V I: but T V $hall be le$s than triple to the $ame. But N T is triple to
all I M: Therefore all V M is more than the fourth part of all M N,
who$e fourth part was $uppo$ed to be M S. Therefore the point V is
nearer to the Vertex than the Point S. Which was to be demon$tra-

<I>greater proportion than O E hath to

ing proportions with which the circum$cribed Figure exceeds the in-
$cribed $hall be R, which is impo$$ible. For the Plane drawn thorow
R equidi$tant to the Ba$e of the Cone doth not cut tho$e proportions. It

<head>PROPOSITION.</head>
<P>The Center of Gravity divideth the Axis of any

<P><I>Let there be a Cone who$e Axis is A B. And in C let it be divided,
$o that A C be triple to the remaining part C B. It is to be proved,
that C is the Center of Gravity of the Cone. For if it be not, the
Cone's Center $hall be either above or below the point C. Let it be fir$t
beneath, and let it be E. And draw the Line L P, by it $elf, equal to
C E; which divided at plea$ure in N. And as both B E and P N to-
gether are to P N, $o let the Cone be to the Solid X: and in$cribe in the
Cone a Solid Figure of Cylinders that have equal Ba$es, who$e Center
of Gravity is le$s di$tant from the point C than is the Line L N, and
the exce$s of the Cone above it le$s than the Solid X. And that this
may be done is manife$t from what hath been already demon$trated.
Now let the in$cribed Figure be $uch as</I>
<fig>
<I>was required, who$e Center of Gravity
let be I. The Line I E therefore $hall be
greater than N P together with L P. Let
C E and I C le$s L N be equal: And be-
cau$e both together B E and N P is to N P
as the Cone to X: and the exce$s by which
the Cone exceeds the in$cribed Figure is
le$s than the Solid X: Therefore the Cone
$hall have greater proportion to the $aid
X S than both B E and N P to N P: and, by
Divi$ion, the in$cribed Figure $hall have
greater proportion to the exce$s by which
the Cone exceeds it, than B E to N P: But B E hath le$s proportion to
E I than to N P with I E. Let N P be greater. Then the in$cribed Fi-
gure hath to the exce$s of the Cone above it much greater proportion
than B E to E I. Therefore as the in$cribed Figure is to the $aid exce$s,
$o $hall a Line bigger than B E be to E I. Let that Line be M E. Becau$e,
therefore, M E is to E I as the in$cribed Figure is to the exce$s of the
Cone above the $aid Figure, and D is the Center of Gravity of the
Cone, and I the Center of Gravity of the in$cribed Figure: Therefore</I>
<foot>M <I>$hall</I></foot>
<p n=>267</p>
<I>M $hall be the Center of Gravity of the remaining proportions by which
the Cone exceeds the in$cribed Figure. Which is impo$$ible. Therefore
the Center of Gravity of the Cone is not below the point C. Nor is it
above it. For if it may be, let it be R. And again a$$ume L P cut at
plea$ure in N: And as both B C and N P together are to N L, $o let the
Cone be to X. And let a Figure be, in like manner, circum$cribed about
the Cone, which exceeds the $aid Cone a le$s quantity than the Solid X.
And let the Line which intercepts bet wixt its Center of Gravity and C,
be le$$er than N P. Now take the circum$cribed Figure, who$e Center
let be O; the remainder O R $hall be greater than the $aid N L. And
becau$e, as both together B C and P N is to N L, $o is the Cone to X:
And the exce$s by which the circum$cribed exceeds the Cone is le$$er
than X: And B O is le$$er than B C and P N together: And O R grea-
ter than L N: The Cone therefore $hall have much greater proportion to
the remaining proportions by which it was exceeded by the circum$cribed
Figure, than B O to O R. Let it be as M O is to O R. M O $hall
be greater than B C; and M $hall be the Center of Gravity of the pro-
portions by which the Cone is exceeded by the circum$cribed Figure.
Which is inconvenient. Therefore the Center of Gravity of the Cone is
not above the point C. But neither is it below it; as hath been proved.
Therefore it $hall be C it $elf. And $o in like manner may it be demon-
$trated in any Pyramid.</I></P>

<P><I>For let A B, B C, B D, and B E be four proportional Lines. And
as B E is to E A, $o let F G be to 3/4 of A C. And as the Line equal
to A B and to double B C and to triple B D is to the Line equal
to the quadruples of A B, B C, and B D, $o let H G be to A C. It is
to be proved, that H F is a fourth part of A B. Fora$much therefore
as A B, B C, B D, and B E</I>
<fig>
<I>are proportionals, A C,
C D, and D E $hall be in
the $ame proportion: And
as the quadruple of the $aid
A B, B C, and B D is to
A B with the double of B C and triple of B D, $o is the quadruple of
A C, C D, and D E; that is, the quadruple of A E; to A C with the
double of C D, and triple of D E. And $o is A C to H G. Therefore
as the triple of A E is to A C, with the double of C D and triple of
D E, $o is 3/4 of A C to H G. And as the triple of A E is to the triple of
E B, $o is 3/4 A C to G F: Therefore, by the Conver$e of the twenty
fourth of the fifth, As triple A E is to A C with double C D and tri-
ple D B, $o is 3/4 of A C to H F: And as the quadruple of A E is to A C
with the double of C D and triple of D B; that is, to A B with C B and
B D, $o is A C to H F. And, by Permutation, as the quadruple of A E
is to A C, $o is A B with C B and B D to H F. And as A C is to A E, $o
is A B to A B with C B and B D. Therefore,</I> ex &aelig;quali, <I>by Perturbed
proportion, as quadruple A E is to A E, $o is A B to H F. Wherefore it
is manife$t that H F is the fourth part of A B.</I></P>

<P><I>From a Cone or Pyramid who$e Axis is A D, and equidi$tant to
the Plane of the Ba$e, let a</I> Fru$tum <I>be cut who$e Axis is V D.
And as the triple of the greate$t Ba$e with the double of the
mean and lea$t is to the triple of the lea$t and double of the mean and
greate$t, $o is \ O to O D. It is to be proved that the Center of Gra-
vity of the</I> Fru$tum <I>is in O. Let V M be the fourth part of V D.
Set the Line H X by the by, equal to A D: and let K X be equal to A V:
and unto H X K let X L be a third proportional, and X S a fourth.
And as H S is to S X, $o let M D be to the Line taken from O towards
A: which let be O N. And becau$e the greater Ba$e is in proportion
to that which is mean betwixt the
greater and le$$er as D A to A V; that</I>
<fig>
<I>is, as H X, to X K, but the $aid
mean is to the lea$t as K X to X L;
the greater, mean, and le$$er Ba$es
$hall be in the $ame proportion as
H X, X K, and X L. Wherefore as
triple the greater Ba$e, with double
the mean and le$$er, is to triple the
lea$t with double the mean and grea-
te$t; that is, as V O is to O D; $o is
triple H X with double X K and X L
to triple X L, with double X K and
X H: And by Compo$ition and Converting the proportion, O D $hall
be to V D, as H X, with double X K and triple X L, to quadruple H X,
X K, and X L. There are, therefore, four proportional Lines, H X,
X K, X L, and X S: And as X S is to S H, $o is the Line taken N O
to 3/4 of D V, to wit, to D M; that is, to 3/4 of H K: And as H X
with double X K and triple X L is to quadruple H X, X K and X L;
$o is another Line taken O D to D V; that is, to H K. Therefore, by
the things demon$trated, D N $hall be the fourth part of H X; that
is, of A D. Wherefore the point N $hall be the Center of Gravity
of the Cone or Pyramid who$e Axis is A D. Let the Center of Gra-
vity of the Pyramid or Cone who$e Axis is A V be I. It is therefore
manife$t that the Center of Gravity of the</I> Fru$tum <I>is in the Line
I N inclining towards the part N, and in that point of it which with
the point N include a Line to which I M hath the $ame proportion that
the</I> Fru$tum <I>cut hath to the Pyramid or Cone who$e Axis is A V.
It remaineth therefore to prove that I N hath the $ame proportion
to N O, that the</I> Fru$tum <I>hath to the Cone who$e Axis is A V. But
as the Cone who$e Axis is D A is to the Cone who$e Axis is A V, $o
is the Cube D A to the Cube D V; that is, the Cube H X to the
Cube X K: But this is the $ame proportion that H X hath to X S.
Wherefore, by Divi$ion, as H S is to S X, $o $hall the</I> Fru$tum <I>who$e</I>

H S is to S X, $o al$o is M D to O N. Wherefore the</I> Fru$tum <I>is to the
Pyramid who$e Axis is A V, as M D to N O. And becau$e A N
is 3/4 of A D; and A I is 3/4 of A V; the remainder I N $hall be 3/4 of the
remainder V D. Wherefore I N $hall be equal to M D.
And it hath been demon$trated that M D is to N O,
as the</I> Fru$tum <I>to the Cone A V. It is mani-

<head>GALILEUS,
HIS
MECHANICKS:
OF THE BENEFIT DERIVED
FROM THE SCIENCE OF MECHANICKS,
AND FROM ITS INSTRUMENTS.</head>
<P>I judged it extreamly nece$$ary, before our
de$cending to the Speculation of Mecha-
nick In$truments, to con$ider how I might,
as it were, $et before your eyes in a gene-
ral Di$cour$e, the many benefits that are
derived from the $aid In$truments: and
this I have thought my $elf the more ob-
liged to do, for that (if I am not mi$taken)
I have $een the generality of <I>M</I>echaniti-
ans deceive them$elves in going about to apply Machines to many
operations of their own nature impo$$ible; by the $ucce$$e where-
of they have been di$appointed, and others likewi$e fru$trate of
the hope which they had conceived upon the promi$e of tho$e pre-
$umptuous undertakers: of which mi$takes I think I have found
the principall cau$e to be the belief and con$tant opinion the$e
<foot>Artificers</foot>
<p n=>272</p>
Artificers had, and $till have, that they are able with a $mall force
to move and rai$e great weights; (in a certain manner with their
Machines cozening nature, who$e In$tinct, yea mo$t po$itive con-
$titution it is, that no Re$i$tance can be overcome, but by a Force
more potent then it:) which conjecture how fal$e it is, I hope by
the en$uing true and nece$$ary Demon$trations to evince.</P>
<P>In the mean time, $ince I have hinted, that the benefit and help
derived from Machines is not, to be able with le$$e Force, by help
of the Machine to move tho$e weights, which, without it, could
not be moved by the $ame Force: it would not be be$ides the
purpo$e to declare what the Commodities be which are derived to
us from $uch like faculties, for if no profit were to be hoped for,
all endeavours employed in the acqui$t thereof will be but lo$t
labour.</P>
<P>Proceeding therefore according to the nature of the$e Studies,
let us fir$t propo$e four things to be con$idered. Fir$t, the weight
to be transferred from place to place; and $econdly, the Force
and Power which $hould move it; thirdly, the Di$tance between
the one and the other Term of the Motion; Fourthly, the Time
in which that mutation is to be made: which Time becometh the
$ame thing with the Dexterity, and Velocity of the Motion; we
determining that Motion to be more $wift then another, which in
le$$e Time pa$$eth an equal Di$tance.</P>
<P>Now, any determinate Re$i$tance and limited Force what$oever
being a$$igned, and any Di$tance given, there is no doubt to be
made, but that the given Force may carry the given Weight to the
determinate Di$tance; for, although the Force were extream
$mall, yet, by dividing the Weight into many $mall parts, none
of which remain $uperiour to the Force, and by transferring them
one by one, it $hall at la$t have carried the whole Weight to the
a$$igned Term: and yet one cannot at the end of the Work with
Rea$on $ay, that that great Weight hath been moved, and tran$-
ported by a Force le$$e then it $elf, howbeit indeed it was done
by a Force, that many times reiterated that Motion, and that
Space, which $hall have been mea$ured but only once by the whole
Weight. From whence it appears, that the Velocity of the Force
hath been as many times Superiour to the Re$i$tance of the weight,
as the $aid Weight was $uperiour to the Force; for that in the
$ame Time that the moving Force hath many times mea$ured the
intervall between the Terms of the Motion, the $aid Moveable
happens to have pa$t it onely once: nor therefore ought we to
affirm a great Re$i$tance to have been overcome by a $mall Force,
contrary to the con$titution of Nature. Then onely may we $ay
the Natural Con$titution is overcome, when the le$$er Force tran$-
fers the greater Re$i$tance, with a Velocity of Motion like to that
<foot>where-</foot>
<p n=>273</p>
wherewith it $elf doth move; which we affirm ab$olutely to be
impo$$ible to be done with any Machine imaginable. But becau$e
it may $ometimes come to pa$$e, that having but little Force, it is
required to move a great Weight all at once, without dividing it
in pieces, on this occa$ion it will be necei$ary to have recour$e to
the Machine, by means whereof the propo$ed Weight may be
transferred to the a$$igned Space by the Force given. But yet
this doth not hinder, but that the $ame Force is to move, mea$uring
that $ame Space, or another equall to it, as many $everall times as
it is exceeded by the $aid Weight. So that in the end of the a-
ction we $hall $ind that we have received from the Machine no
other benefit tnen only that of tran$porting the $aid Weight with
the given Force to the Term given, all at once. Which Weight,
being divided into parts, would without any Machine have been
carried by the $ame Force, in the $ame Time, through the $ame
Intervall. And this ought to pa$$e for one of the benefits taken
from the Mechanicks: for indeed it frequently happens, that be-
ing $canted in Force but not Time, we are put upon moving great
Weights unitedly or in gro$$e: but he that $hould hope, and at-
tempt to do the $ame by the help of Machines without increa$e of
Tardity in the Moveable, would certainly be deceived, and would
declare his ignorance of the u$e of Mechanick In$truments, and
the rea$on of their effects.</P>
<P>Another benefit is drawn from the In$truments, which depend-
eth on the place wherein the operation is to be made: for all In-
$truments cannot be made u$e of in all places with equall conve-
nience. And $o we $ee (to explain our $elves by an example) that
for drawing of Water out of a Well, we make u$e of onely a
Rope and a Bucket fitted to receive and hold Water, wherewith
we draw up a determinate quantity of Water, in a certain Time,
with our limited $trength: and he that $hould think he could with
a Machine of what$oever Force, with the $ame $trength, and in
the $ame Time, take up a great quantity of Water, is in a gro$$e
Errour. And he $hall find him$elf $o much the more deceived,
the more he $hall vary and multiply his Inventions: Yet never-
thele$$e we $ee Water drawn up with other Engines, as with a Pump
that drinks up Water in the Hold of Ships; where you mu$t note
that the Pump was not imployed in tho$e Offices, for that it draws
up more Water in the $ame Time, and with the $ame $trength
then that which a bare Bucket would do, but becau$e in that place
the u$e of the Bucket or any $uch like Ve$$el could not effect what
is de$ired, namely to keep the Hold of the Ship quite dry from e-
very little quantity of Water; which the Bucket cannot do, for
that it cannot dimerge and dive, where there is not a con$iderable
depth of Water. And thus we $ee the Holds of Ships by the
<foot>Nn $aid</foot>
<p n=>274</p>
$aid In$trument kept dry, when Water cannot but onely oblique-
ly be drawn up, which the ordinary u$e of the Bucket would not
effect, which ri$eth and de$cends with its Rope perpendicu-
larly.</P>
<P>The third is a greater benefit, haply, then all the re$t that are
derived from Mechanick In$truments, and re$pects the a$$i$tance
which is borrowed of $ome Force exanimate, as of the $tream of a
River, or el$e animate, but of le$$e expence by far, then that which
would be nece$$ary for maintaining humane $trength: as when to
turn Mills, we make u$e of the Current of a River, or the $trength
of a Hor$e, to effect that, which would require the $trength of five
or fix Men. And this we may al$o advantage our $elves in rai$ing
Water, or making other violent Motions, which mu$t have been
done by Men, if there were no other helps; becau$e with one $ole
Ve$$el we may take Water, and rai$e, and empty it where occa$ion
requires; but becau$e the Hor$e, or $uch other Mover wanteth
Rea$on, and tho$e In$truments which are requi$ite for holding and
emptying the Ve$$el in due time, returning again to fill it, and one-
ly is endued with Force, therefore it's nece$$ary that the Mecha-
nitian $upply the naturall defect of that Mover, furni$hing it with
$uch devices and inventions, that with the $ole application of it's
Force the defired effect may follow. And therein is very great
advantage, not becau$e that a Wheel or other Machine can enable
one to tran$port the $ame Weight with le$$e Force, and greater
Dexterity, or a greater Space than an equall Force, without tho$e
In$truments, but having Judgment and proper Organs, could have
done; but becau$e that the $tream of a River co$teth little or
nothing, and the charge of keeping of an Hor$e or other Bea$t,
who$e $trength is greater then that of eight, or it may be more
Men, is far le$$e then what $o many Men would be kept
for.</P>
<P>The$e then are the benefits that may be derived from Mecha-
nick In$truments, and not tho$e which ignorant Engineers dream
of, to their own di$grace, and the abu$e of $o many Princes,
whil$t they undertake impo$$ible enterprizes; of which, both
by the little which hath been hinted, and by the much which
$hall be demon$trated in the Progre$$e of this Treati$e, we $hall
come to a$$ure our $elves, if we attentively heed that which $hall
be $poken.</P>

<head>DEFINITIONS.</head>
<P>That which in all Demon$trative Sciences is nece$$ary to be
ob$erved, we ought al$o to follow in this Di$cour$e, that is;
to propound the Definitions of the proper Terms of this
Art, and the primary Suppo$itions, from which, as from $eeds full
of fecundity, may of con$equence $pring and re$ult the cau$es,
and true Demon$trations, of the Nature of all the Mechanick
Engines which are u$ed, for the mo$t part about the Motions of
Grave Matters, therefore we will determine, fir$t, what is <I>GRA-
VITIE.</I></P>
<P>We call <I>GRAVITIE</I> then, That propen$ion of moving
naturally downwards, which is found in $olid Bodies, cau$ed by
the greater or le$$e quantity of matter, whereof they are con$ti-
tuted.</P>
<P><I>MOMENT</I> is the propen$ion of de$cending, cau$ed not $o
much by the Gravity of the moveable, as by the di$po$ure which
divers Grave Bodies have in relation to one another; by means of
whichMoment, we oft $ee a Body le$s Grave counterpoi$e another
of greater Gravity: as in the Stiliard, a great Weight i<*> rai$ed by
a very $mall counterpoi$e, not through exce$s of Gravity, but
through the remotene$$e from the point whereby the Beam is up-
held, which conjoyned to the Gravity of the le$$er weight adds
thereunto Moment, and <I>Impetus</I> of de$cending, wherewith the
Moment of the other greater Gravity may be exceeded. <I>MO-
MENT</I> then is that IMPETUS of de$cending, compounded
of Gravity, Po$ition, and the like, whereby that propenfion may
be occa$ioned</P>
<P>The <I>CENTER</I> of <I>GRAVITY</I> we define to be that point
in every Grave Body, about which con$i$t parts of equall Moment:
$o that, imagining $ome Grave Body to be $u$pended and $u$tain-
ed by the $aid point, the parts on the right hand will Equilibrate
tho$e on the left, the Anteriour, the Po$teriour, and tho$e above
tho$e below; $o that be it in any what$oever fite, and po$ition,
provided it be $u$pended by the $aid <I>CENTER,</I> it $hall $tand
$till: and this is that point which would gladly unite with the
univer$all Center of Grave Bodies, namely withthat of the Earth,
if it might thorow $ome free <I>Medium</I> de$cend thither. From
whence we take the$e Suppo$itions.</P>
<foot>Nn 2 SUPPO</foot>
<p n=>276</p>
<head>SUPPOSITIONS.</head>
<P>Any Grave Body, (as to what belongeth to it's proper ver-
tue) moveth downwards, $o that the Center of it's Gravity
never $trayeth out of that Right Line which is produced
from the $aid Center placed in the fir$t Term of the Motion unto
the univer$al Center of Grave Bodies. Which is a Suppo$ition
very manife$t, becau$e that $ingle Center being obliged to endea-
vour to unite with the common Center, it's nece$$ary, unle$$e $ome
impediment intervene, that it go $eeking it by the $horte$t Line,
which is the Right alone: And from hence may we $econdarily
$uppo$e</P>
<P>Every Grave Body putteth the greate$t $tre$$e, and weigheth
mo$t on the Center of it's Gravity, and to it, as to its proper $eat,
all <I>Impetus,</I> all Pondero$ity, and, in $ome, all Moment hath re-
cour$e.</P>
<P>We la$tly $uppo$e the Center of the Gravity of two Bodies e-
qually Grave to be in the mid$t of that Right Line which conjoyns
the $aid two Centers; or that two equall weights, $u$pended in
equall di$tence, $hall have the point of <I>Equilibrium</I> in the common
Center, or meeting of tho$e equal Di$tances. As for Example,
the Di$tance C E being equall to the Di$tance E D, and there be-
ing by them two equall weights $u$pended, A and B, we $uppo$e
the point of <I>Equilibrium</I> to be in the point E, there being no
greater rea$on for inclining to
one, then to the other part. But
<fig>
here is to be noted, that the Di-
$tances ought to be mea$ured
with Perpendicular Lines, which
from the point of Su$pen$ion E,
fall on the Right Lines, that from
the Center of the Gravity of the
Weights A and B, are drawn to
the common Center of things
Grave; and therefore if the Di$tance E D were tran$ported into
E F, the weight B would not counterpoi$e the weight A, becau$e
drawing from the Centers of Gravity two Right Lines to the Cen-
ter of the Earth, we $hall $ee that which cometh from the Center
of the Weight I, to be nearer to the Center E, then the other
produced from the Center of the weight A. Therefore our $aying
that equal Weights are $u$pended by [or at] equal Di$tances, is
to be under$tood to be meant when as the Right Lines that go from
their Centers &amp; to $eek out the common Center of Gravity, $hall be
equidi$ta nt from that Right Line, which is produced from the $aid
<foot>Term</foot>
<p n=>277</p>
Term of tho$e Di$tances, that is from the point of Su$pen$ion, to
the $ame Center of the Earrh.</P>
<P>The$e things determined and $uppo$ed, we come to the explica-
tion of a Principle, the mo$t common and materiall of the greater
part of Mechanick In$truments: demon$trating, that unequall
Weights weigh equally when $u$pended by [or at] unequal Di$tan-
ces, which have contrary proportion to that which tho$e weights
are found to have, See the Demon$tration in the beginning of the
$econd Dialogue of Local-Motions.</P>
<head><I>Some Adverii$ements about what hath been $aid.</I></head>
<P>Now being that Weights unequall come to acquire equall
Moment, by being alternately $u$pended at Di$tances that
have the $ame proportion with them; I think it not fit to
over pa$$e with $ilence another congruicy and probability, which
may confirm the $ame truth; for let the Ballance A B, be con$ide-
red, as it is divided into unequal parts in the point C, and let the
Weights be of the $ame propor-
<fig>
tion that is between the Di$tan-
ces B C, and C A, alternately
$u$pended by the points A, and
B: It is already manife$t, that
the one will counterpoi$e the
other, and con$equently, that
were there added to one of them
a very $mall Moment of Gravity, it would preponderate, rai$ing
the other, $o that an in$en$ible Weight put to the Grave B, the
Ballance would move and de$cend from the point B towards E,
and the other extream A would a$cend into D, and in regard that
to weigh down B, every $mall Gravity is $ufficient, therefore not
keeping any accompt of this in$en$ible Moment, we will put no
difference between one Weights <I>$u$taining,</I> and one Weights
<I>moving</I> another. Now, let us con$ider the Motion which the
Weight B makes, de$cending into E, and that which the other
A makes in a$cending into D, we $hall without doubt find the
Space B E to be $o much greater than the Space A D, as the Di-
$tance B C is greater than C A, forming in the Center C two an-
gles D C A, and E C B, equall as being at the Cock, and con$e-
quently two Circumferences A D and B E alike; and to have the
$ame proportion to one another, as have the Semidiameters B C,
and C A, by which they are de$cribed: $o that then the Velocity
of the Motion of the de$cending Grave B cometh to be $o much
Superiour to the Velocity of the other a$cending Moveable A, as
the Gravity of this exceeds the Gravity of that; and it not being
<foot>po$$ible</foot>
<p n=>278</p>
po$$ible that the Weight A $hould be rai$ed to D, although $low-
ly, unle$$e the other Weight B do move to E $wiftly, it will not
be $trange, or incon$i$tent with the Order of Nature, that the
Velocity of the Motion of the Grave B, do compen$ate the greater
Re$i$tance of the Weight A, $o long as it moveth $lowly to D,
and the other de$cendeth $wiftly to E, and $o on the contrary,
the Weight A being placed in the point D, and the other B in
the point E, it will not be unrea$onable that that falling lea$urely
to A, $hould be able to rai$e the other ha$tily to B, recovering by
its Gravity what it had lo$t by it's Tardity of Motion. And by
this Di$cour$e we may come to know how the Velocity of the
Motion is able to encrea$e Moment in the Moveable, according to
that $ame proportion by which the $aid Velocity of the Motion is
augmented.</P>
<P>There is al$o another thing, before we proceed any farther, to
be confidered; and this is touching the Di$tances, whereat, or
wherein Weights do hang: for it much imports how we are to
under$tand Di$tances equall, and unequall; and, in $um, in what
manner they ought to be mea-
<fig>
$ured: for that A B being the
Right Line, and two equall
Weights being $u$pended at
the very ends thereof, the point
C being taken in the mid$t of
the $aid Line, there $hall be an
<I>Equilibrium</I> upon the $ame:
And the rea$on is for that the
Di$tance C B is equal to C A.
But if elevating the Line C B, moving it about the point C, it
$hall be transferred into CD, $o that the Ballance $tand according
to the two Lines A C, and C D, the two equall Weights hanging
at the Terms A and D, $hall no longer weigh equally on that
point C, becau$e the di$tance of the Weight placed in D, is made
le$$e then it was when it hanged in B. For if we confider the Lines,
along [or by] which the $aid Graves make their Impul$e, and
would de$cend, in ca$e they were freely moved, there is no doubt
but that they would make or de$cribe the Lines A G, D F, B H:
Therefore the Weight hanging on the point D, maketh it's Moment
and <I>Impetus</I> according to the Line D F: but when it hanged in
B, it made <I>Impetus</I> in the Line B H: and becau$e the Line D F is
nearer to the Fulciment C, then is the Line B H Therefore we
are to under$tand that the Weights hanging on the points A and D,
are not equi-di$tant from the point C, as they be when they are
con$tituted according to their Right Line A C B: And la$tly,
we are to take notice, that the Di$tance is to be mea$ured by
<foot>Lines,</foot>
<p n=>279</p>
Lines, which fall at Right Angles on tho$e whereon the Weights
hang, and would move, if $o be they were permitted to de$cend
freely.</P>
<head>Of the BALLANCE and LEAVER.</head>
<P>Having under$tood by certain Demon$tration, one of the
fir$t Principles, from which, as from a plenti$ul Fountain,
many of the Mechanical In$truments are derived, we may
take occa$ion without any difficulty to come to the knowledge of
the nature of them: and fir$t $peaking of the Stiliard, an In$tru-
ment of mo$t ordinary u$e, with which divers Merchandizes are
weighed, $u$taining them, though very heavy, with a very $mall
counterpoi$e, which is com-
monly called the Roman or

there is no more to be done in
$uch an operation, but to re-
duce into act and practice
what hath been above contemplated. For if we propo$e the Bal-
lance A B, who$e Fulciment or Lanquet is in the point C, by
which, at the $mall Di$tance C A, hangeth the heavy Weight D,
and if along the other greater C B, (which we call the Needle of
the Stiliard) we $hould $uppo$e the Roman F, though of but little
weight in compari$on of the Grave Body D to be $lipped to and
fro, it $hall be pof$ible to place it $o remotely from the Lanquet C,
that the $ame proportion may be found between the two Weights
D and F, as is between the Di$tances F C, and C A: and then $hall
an <I>Equilibrium</I> $ucceed; unequall Weights hanging at Di$tances
alternately proportional to them.</P>
<P>Nor is this In$trument different from that other called <I>Vectis,</I>
<marg>If of Iron, it is
called a Crow,
if of wood, a Bar
or Hand-$pike.</marg>
and vulgarly the ^{*} Leaver, wherewith great Weights are moved
by $mall Force; the application of which is according to the Fi-
gure prefixed; wherein the Leaver
is repre$ented by the Bar of wood
or other $olid matter, <I>B</I> C D, let
<fig>
the heavy Weight to be rai$ed be
A, and let the $teadfa$t $upport
or Fulciment on which the Leaver
re$ts and moves be $uppo$ed to be
E, and putting one end of the
Leaver under the Weight A, as
may be $een in the point C, en-
crea$ing the Weight or Force at the other end D, it will be able
to lift up the Weight A, though not much, whenever the Force in
<foot>D hath</foot>
<p n=>280</p>
D hath the $ame proportion to the Re$i$tance made by the Weight
A, in the point C: as the Di$tance <I>B</I> C hath to the Di$tance C D,
whereby it's clear, that the nearer the Fulciment E $hall approach
to the Term B, encrea$ing the proportion of the Di$tance D C to
the Di$tance C <I>B,</I> the more may one dimini$h the Force in D which
is to rai$e the Weight A. And here it is to be noted, which I $hall
al$o in its place remember you of, that the benefit drawn from all
Mechanical In$truments, is not that which the vulgar Mechanitians
do per$wade us, to wit, $uch, that there by Nature is overcome, and
in a certain manner deluded, a $mall Force over-powring a very
great Re$i$tance with help of the Leaver; for we $hall demon$trate,
that without the help of the length of the Leaver, the $ame Force,
in the $ame Time, $hall work the $ame effect. For taking the $ame
Leaver B C D, who$e re$t or Fulci-
ment is in C, let the Di$tance C D
<fig>
be $uppo$ed, for example, to be
in quintuple proportion to the
Di$tance C <I>B,</I> &amp; the $aid Leaver to
be moved till it come to I C G: In
the Time that the Force $hall have
pa$$ed the Space D I, the Weight
$hall have been moved from B
to G: and becau$e the Di$tance
D C, was $uppo$ed quintuple to the other C B, it is manife$t from
the things demon$trated, that the Weight placed in B may be five
times greater then the moving Force $uppo$ed to be in D: but now,
<marg>Or Space.</marg>
if on the contrary, we take notice of the ^{*} Way pa$$ed by
the Force from D unto I, whil$t the Weight is moved from B unto
G, we $hall find likewi$e the Way D I, to be quintuple to the Space
B G. Moreover if we take the Di$tance C L, equal to the Di$tance
C B, and place the $ame Force that was in D, in the point L, and
in the point B the fifth part onely of the Weight that was put there
at fir$t, there is no que$tion, but that the Force in L being now
equal to this Weight in B, and the Di$tances L C and C B being
equall, the $aid Force $hall be able, being moved along the Space LM
to transfer the Weight equall to it $elf, thorow the other equall
Space B G: which five times reiterating this $ame action, $hall tran$-
port all the parts of the $aid Weight to the $ame Term G: But
the repeating of the Space L M, is certainly nothing more nor le$$e
then the onely once mea$uring the Space D I, quintuple to the
$aid L M. Therefore the transferring of the Weight from B to G,
requireth no le$$e Force, nor le$$e Time, nor a $horter Way if it
wee placed in D, than it would need if the $ame were applied
in L: And, in $hort, the benefit that is derived from the length of
the Leaver C D, is no other, $ave the enabling us to move that
<foot>Body</foot>
<p n=>281</p>
Body all at once, which would not have been moved by the $ame
Force, in the $ame Time, with an equall Motion, $ave onely in
pieces, without the help of the Leaver.</P>
<head><I>Of the</I> CAPSTEN <I>and of the</I> CRANE.</head>
<P>The In$truments which we are now about to declare, have
immediate dependence upon the Leaver, nay, are no other
but a perpetual Vectis or Leaver. For if we $hall $uppo$e the
Leaver B A C to be $u$tained in
the point A, and the Weight G to
<fig>
hang at the point B, the Force be-
ing placed in C; It is manife$t,
that transferring the Leaver unto
the points D A E, the Weight G
doth alter according to the Di-
$tance B D, but cannot much far-
ther continue to rai$e it, $o that
if it were required to elevate it yet
higher, it would be nece$$ary to
$tay it by $ome other Fulciment
in this Po$ition, and to remit or return the Leaver to its former Po-
$ition B A C, and $u$pending the Weight anew thereat, to rai$e it
once again to the like height B D; and in this manner repeating
the work, many times one $hall come with an interrupted Motion
to effect the drawing up of the Weight, which for many re$pects
will not prove very beneficial: whereupon this difficulty hath bin
thought on, and remedied, by finding out a way how to unite to-
gether almo$t infinite Leavers, perpetuating the operation without
any interruption; and this hath been done by framing a Wheel
about the Center A, according to the Semidiameter A C, and an
Axis or Nave, about the $ame Center, of which let the Line A B
be the Semidiameter; and all this of very tough wood, or of other
$trong and $olid matter, afterwards $u$taining the whole Machine
upon a Gudgeon or Pin of Iron planted in the point A, which
pa$$eth quite thorow, where it is held fa$t by two fixed Fulciments,
and the Rope D B G, at which the weight G hangeth, being be-laid
or wound about the Axis or Barrell, and applying another Rope
about the greater Wheel, at which let the other Grave I be hang-
ed: It is manife$t, that the length C A having to the other A B
the $elf-$ame proportion that the Weight G hath to the Weight I,
it may $u$tain the Grave G, and with any little Moment more $hall
move it: and becau$e the Axis turning round together with the
Wheel, the Ropes that $u$tain the Weights are alwaies pendent and
contingent with the extream Circumferences of that Wheel and
<foot>Oo Axis,</foot>
<p n=>282</p>
Axis, $o that they $hall con$tantly maintain alike Site and Po$ition
in re$pect of the Di$tances B A and A C, the Motion $hall be
perpetuated, the Weight I de$cending, and forcing the other G
to a$cend. Where we are to ob$erve the nece$$ity of be-laying
or winding the Rope about the Wheel, that $o the Weight I may
hang according to the Line that is tangent to the $aid Wheel: for
if one $hould $u$pend the $aid Weight, $o as that it did hang by the
point F, cutting the $aid Wheel, as is $een along the Line F N M,
the Motion would cea$e, the Moment of the Weight M being di-
mini$hed; which would weigh no more then if it did hang by the
point N: becau$e the Di$tance of its Su$pen$ion from the Center
A, cometh to be determined by the Line A N, which falleth per-
pendicularly upon the Rope F M, and is no longer terminated by
the Semidiameter of the Wheel A F, which falleth at unequall
Angles upon the $aid Line F M. A violence therefore being offered
in the Circumference of the Wheel by a Grave and Exanimate
Body that hath no other <I>Impetus</I> then that of De$cending, it is
nece$$ary that it be $u$tained by a Line that is contingent with
the Wheel, and not by one that cutteth it. But if in the $ame
Circumference an Animate Force were employed, that had a Mo-
ment or Faculty of making an <I>Impul$e</I> on all $ides, the work might
be effected in any whatever place of the $aid Circumference. And
thus being placed in F, it would draw up the Weight by turning
the Wheel about, pulling not according to the Line F M down-
wards, but $ide-waies according to the Contingent Line F L, which
maketh a Right Angle, with that which is drawn from the Center
A unto the point of Contact F: $o, that if in this manner one do
mea$ure the Di$tance from the Center A to the Force placed in
F, according to the Line A F perpendicular to F L, along which
the <I>Impetus</I> is made, a man $hall not in any part have altered the
u$e of the ordinary Leaver. And we mu$t note, that the $ame
would be po$$ible to be done likewi$e with an Exanimate Force,
in ca$e that a way were found out to cau$e that its Moment might
make Impul$e in the point F, drawing according to the Contingent
Line F L: which would be done by adjoyning beneath the Line F L
a turning Pulley, making the Rope wound about the Wheel to
pa$$e along upon it, as it is $een to do by the Line F L X, $u$pending
at the end thereof the Weight X equall to the other I, which ex-
erci$ing its Force according to the Line F L, $hall alwaies keep a
Di$tance from the Center A equall unto the Semidiameter of the
Wheel. And from what hath been declared we will gather for a
Conclu$ion, That in this In$trument the Force hath alwaies the
$ame proportion to the Weight, as the Semidiameter of the Axis
or Barrell hath to the Semidiameter of the Wheel.</P>
<foot>From</foot>
<p n=>283</p>
<P>From the In$trument la$t de$cribed, the other In$trument which
we call the Crane is not much different, as to form, nay, differeth
nothing, $ave in the way of applying or employing it: For that the
Cap$ten moveth and is con$tituted perpendicular to the Horizon,
and the Crane worketh with its Moment parallel to the $ame Ho-
<fig>
rizon. For if upon the Circle D A E we $uppo$e an Axis to be
placed Column-wi$e, turning about the Center B, and about which
the Rope D H, fa$tened to the Weight that is to be drawn, is be-
laid, and if the Bar F E B D be let into the $aid Axis [<I>by the Mor-
tace B</I>] and the Force of a Man, of an Hor$e, or of $ome other
Animal apt to draw, be applyed at its end F, which moving round,
pa$$eth along the Circumference F G C, the Crane $hall be framed
and fini$hed, $o that by carrying round the Bar F B D, the Barrell
or Axis E A D $hall turn about, and the Rope which is twined a-
bout it, $hall con$train the Weight H to go forward: And becau$e
the point of the Fulciment about which the Motion is made, is the
point B, and the Moment keeps at a Di$tance from it according to
the Line B F, and the Re$i$tor at the Di$tance B D, the Leaver
F B D is formed, by vertue of which the Force acquireth Moment
equall to the Re$i$tance, if $o be, that it be in proportion to it, as
the Line B D is to B F, that is, as the Semidiameter of the Axis to
the Semidiameter of the Circle, along who$e Circumference the
Force moveth. And both in this, and in the other In$trument we
are to ob$erve that which hath been frequently mentioned, that is,
That the benefit which is derived from the$e Machines, is not that
which the generality of the Vulgar promi$e them$elves from the
Mechanicks; namely, that being too hard for Nature, its po$$ible
<foot>Oo2 with</foot>
<p n=>284</p>
with a Machine to overcome a Re$i$tance, though great, with a
$mall Force, in regard, that we $hall manife$tly prove that the $ame
Force placed in F, might in the $ame Time conveigh the $ame
Weight, with the $ame Motion, unto the $ame Di$tance, without
any Machine at all: For $uppo$ing, for example, that the Re$i$tance
of the Grave H be ten times greater than the Force placed in F, it
<fig>
will be requi$ite for the mo-
ving of the $aid Re$i$tance,
that the Line F B be decuple
to B D; and con$equently,
that the Circumference of the
Circle F G C be al$o decuple
to the Circumference E A D:
and becau$e when the Force
$hall be moved once along the
whole Circumference of the
Circle F G C, the Barrel EAD,
about which the Rope is be-laid which draweth the Weight, $hall
likewi$e have given one onely turn; it is manife$t, that the Weight
H $hall not have been moved more than the tenth part of that way
which the Mover $hall have gone. If therefore the Force that is to
move a Re$i$tance that is greater than it $elf, for $uch an a$$igned
Space by help of this Machine, mu$t of nece$$ity move ten times as
far, there is no doubt, but that dividing that Weight into ten parts,
each of them $hall be equall to the Force, and con$equently, might
have been tran$ported one at a Time, as great a Space as that
which it $elf did move, $o that making ten journeys, each equal to
the Circumference E A D, it $hall not have gone any farther than
if it did move but once alone about the Circumference F G C;
and $hall have conveighed the $ame Weight H to the $ame Di-
$tance. The benefit therefore that is to be derived from the$e
Machines is, that they carry all the Weight together, but not with
le$$e Labour, or with greater Expedition, or a greater Way than
the $ame Force might have done conveying it by parcels.</P>
<head>Of PULLIES.</head>
<P>The In$truments, who$e Natures are reducible unto the Bal-
lance, as to their Principle and Foundation, and others little
differing from them, have been already de$cribed; now for
the under$tanding of that which we have to $ay touching Pullies,
it is requi$ite, that we con$ider in the fir$t place another way to u$e
the Leaver, which will conduce much towards the inve$tigation of
the Force of Pullies, and towards the under$tanding of other Me-
chanical Effects. The u$e of the Leaver above declared $uppo$ed
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>285</p>
the Weight to be at one extream, and the Force at the other, and
the Fulciment placed in $ome point between the extreams: but we
may make u$e of the Leaver another way, yet, placing, as we $ee,
the Fulciment in the extream A, the Force in the other extream C,
and $uppo$ing the Weight D to hang by $ome point in the mid$t,
<fig>
as here we $ee by the point B, in
this example it's manife$t, that if
the Weight did hang at a point
Equi-di$tant from the two ex-
treams A and C, as at the point F,
the labour of $u$taining it would
be equally divided betwixt the
two points A and C, $o that half
the Weight would be felt by the
Force C, the other half being $u-
$tained by the Fulciment A: but if the Grave Body $hall be hanged
at another place, as at B, we $hall $hew that the Force in C is $uffi-
cient to $u$tain the Weight in B, as it hath the $ame proportion
to it, that the Di$tance, A B hath to the Di$tance A C. For De-
mon$tration of which, let us imagine the Line B A to be continued
right out unto G, and let the Di$tance B A be equall to A G, and
let the Weight hanging at G, be $uppo$ed equall to D: It is ma-
nife$t, that by rea$on of the equality of the Weights D and E, and
of the Di$tances G A and A B, the Moment of the Weight E
$hall equalize the Moment of the Weight D, and is $ufficient to
$u$tain it: Therefore whatever Force $hall have Moment equall to
that of the Weight E, and that $hall be able to $u$tain it, $hall be
$ufficient likewi$e to $u$tain the Weight D: But for $u$taining the
Weight E, let there be placed in the point C $uch a Force, who$e
Moment hath that proportion to the Weight E, that the Di$tance
G A hath to the Di$tance A C, it $hall be $ufficient to $u$tain it:
Therefore the $ame Force $hall likewi$e be able to $u$tain the
Weight D, who$e Moment is equall to the of E: But look what
Proportion the Line G A hath to the Line A C; and A B al$o hath
the $ame to the $aid A C, G A having been $uppo$ed equall to A B:
And becau$e the Weights E and D are equall, each of them $hall
have the $ame proportion to the Force placed in C: Therefore the
Force in C is concluded to equall the Moment of the Weight D,
as often as it hath unto it the $ame proportion that the Di$tance B A
hath to the Di$tance C A. And by moving the Weight, with the
Leaver u$ed in this manner, it is gathered in this al$o, as well as in
the other In$truments, that what is gained in Force is lo$t in Velo-
city: for the Force C rai$ing the Leaver, and transferring it to A I,
the Weight is moved the Space B H, which is as much le$$er than
the Space C I pa$$ed by the Force, as the Di$tance A B is le$$er
<foot>than</foot>
<p n=>286</p>
than the Di$tance A C; that is, as the Force is le$$e than the
Weight.</P>
<P>The$e Principles being declared, we will pa$$e to the Contem-
plation of Pullies, the compo$ition and $tructure of which, together
with their u$e, $hall be de$cribed by us. And fir$t let us $uppo$e the
<marg>*Called by $ome
a Nut.</marg>
^{*} Little Pulley A B C, made of Mettall or hard Wood, voluble a-
bout it's Axis which pa$$eth thorow it's Center D, and about this
<fig>
Pulley let the Rope E A B C be put,
at one end of whichlet the Weight E
hang, and at the other let us $uppo$e
the Force F. I $ay, that the Weight
being $u$tained by a Force equall to
it $elf in the upper Nut or Pulley
A B C, bringeth $ome benefit, as the
moving or $u$taining of the $aid
Weight with the Force placed in F:
For if we $hall under$tand, that from
the Center D, which is the place of the Fulciment, two Lines be
drawn out as far as the Circumference of the Pulley in the points
A and C, in which the pendent Cords touch the Circumference, we
$hall have a Ballance of equal Arms which determine the Di$tance
of the two Su$pen$ions from the Center and Fulciment D: Where-
upon it is manife$t, that the Weight hanging at A cannot be $u$tain-
ed by a le$$er Weight hanging at G, but by one equal to it; $uch
is the nature of equal Weights hanging at equal Di$tances. And
although in moving downwards, the Force F cometh to turn about
the Pulley A B C, yet there followeth no alteration of the Alti-
tude or Re$pect, that the Weight and Force have unto the two
Di$tances A D and D C, nay, the Pulley encompa$$ed becometh a
Ballance equal to A C, but perpetuall. Whence we may learn,
how childi$hly <I>Ari$totle</I> deceiveth him$elf, who holds, that by making
the $mall Pulley A B C bigger, one might draw up the Weight with
a le$$er Force; he con$idering that upon the enlargement of the
$aid Pulley, the Di$tance D C encrea$ed, but not con$idering that
there was as great an encrea$e of the other Di$tance of the Weight,
that is, the other Semidiameter D A. The benefit therefore that may
be drawn from the In$trument above $aid, is nothing at all as to the
diminution of the labour: and if any one $hould ask how it hap-
pens, that on many occa$ions of rai$ing Weights, this means is made
u$e of to help the Axis, as we $ee, for example, in drawing up the
Water of Wells; it is an$wered, that that is done, becau$e that
by this means the manner of employing the Force is found more
commodious: for being to pull downwards, the proper Gravity of
our Arms and other parts help us, whereas if we were to draw
the fame Weight upwards with a meer Rope, by the $ole $trength
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>287</p>
of the Members and Mu$cles, and as we u$e to $ay, by Force of
Armes, be$ides the extern Weight, we are to lift up the Weight of
our own Armes, in which greater pains is required. Conclude we,
therefore, that this upper Pulley doth not bring any Facility to the
Force $imply con$idered, but onely to the manner of applying it:
but if we $hall make u$e of the like Machine
<fig>
in another manner, as we are now about to
declare; we may rai$e the Weight with di-
minution of Forces: For let the Pulley
B D C be voluble about the Center E placed
in it's Frame B L C, at which hang the
Grave G; and let the Rope A B D C F
pa$$e about the Pulley; of which let the end
A be fa$tned to $ome fixed $tay, and in the
other F let the Force be placed; which
moving to wards H $hall rai$e the Machine
B L C, and con$equently the Weight G:
and in this operation I $ay, that the Force in
F is the half of the Weight $u$tained by it.
For the $aid Weight being kept to Rights by the two ^{*} Ropes A B
<marg>* Or two ends of
the $ame Rope.</marg>
and F C, it is manife$t, that the Labour is equally $hared betwixt
the Force F and the Fulciment A: and more $ubtilly examining the
nature of this In$trument, if we but continue forth the Diameter
B E C, we $hall $ee a Leaver to be made, at the mid$t of which, that
is at the point E, the Grave doth hang, and the Fulciment cometh
to be at the end B, and the Force in the Term C: whereupon, by
what hath been above demon$trated, the Force $hall have the $ame
proportion to the Weight, that the Di$tance E B hath to the Di-
$tance; Therefore it $hall be the half of the $aid Weight: And
becau$e the Force ri$ing towards A, the Pulley turneth round,
therefore that Re$pect or Con$titution which the Fulciment B and
Center E, on which the Weight and Term C, in which the Force
is employed do depend, $hall not change all the while; but yet in
the Circuinduction the Terms B and C happen to vary in number,
but not in vertue, others and others continually $ucceeding in their
place, whereby the Leaver B C cometh to be perpetuated. And
here (as hath been done in the other In$truments, and $hall be in
tho$e that follow) we will not pa$$e without con$idering how that
the journey that the Force maketh, is double to the Moment of the
Weight. For in ca$e the Weight $hall be moved $o far, till that
the Line B C come to arrive wi<*>h it's points B and C, at the points
A and F, it is nece$$ary that the two equal Ropes be di$tended in
one $ole Line F H, and con$equently, when the Weight $hall have
a$cended along the Intervall B A, the Force $hall have been moved
twice as far, that is, from <I>F</I> unto H. Then con$idering that the
<foot><I>F</I>orce</foot>
<p n=>288</p>
Force in <I>F,</I> that it may rai$e the Weight, mu$t move upwards, which
to exanimate Movers, as being for the mo$t part Grave Bodies, is al-
<fig>
together impo$$ible, or at lea$t more laborious,
than the making of the $ame <I>F</I>orce down-
wards: Therefore to help this inconvenience,
a Remedy hath been found by adjoyning an-
other Nut or Pulley above, as in the adjacent
<I>F</I>igure is $een, where the Rope C E <I>F</I> hath
been made to pa$s about the upper Pulley <I>F</I> G
upheld by the Hook L, $o that the Rope pa$$ing
to H, and thither transferring the <I>F</I>orce E, it
$hall be able to move the Weight X by pulling
downwards, but not that it may be le$$er than
it was in E: <I>F</I>or the Motions of the <I>F</I>orce
<I>F</I> H, hanging at the equal Di$tances <I>F</I> D and
D G of the upper Pulley, do alwaies continue
equal; nor doth that upper Pulley (as hath
been $hewn above) come to produce any di-
minution in the Labour. Moreover it having been nece$$ary by
the addition of the upper Pulley to introduce the Appendix B, by
which it is $u$tained, it will prove of $ome benefit to us to rai$e
the other A, to which one end of the Rope was fa$tned, transferring
it to a Ring annexed to the lower part of the <I>F</I>rame of the upper
Pulley, as we $ee it done in M. Now finally, this Machine com-
pounded of upper and lower Pullies, is that which the Greeks call
<marg>In Latine <I>Tro-
chlea.</I></marg>
<G>*tpoxi/lion.</G></P>
<P>We have hitherto explained, how by help of Pullies one may
double the <I>F</I>orce, it remaineth that with the greate$t brevity po$-
$ible, we $hew the way how to encrea$e it according to any Multi-
plicity. And fir$t we will $peak of the Multiplicity according to
the even numbers, and then the odde: To $hew how we may mul-
tiply the <I>F</I>orce in a quadruple Proportion, we will propound the
following Speculation as the Soul of all that followeth.</P>
<P>Take two Leavers, A B, C D, with the <I>F</I>ulciments in the ex-
<fig>
treams A and C; and at the middles
of each of them let the Grave G hang,
$u$tained by two <I>F</I>orces of equal Mo-
ment placed in B and D. I $ay, that
the Moment of each of them will
equal the Moment of the fourth part
of the Weight G. <I>F</I>or the two <I>F</I>or-
ces B and D bearing equally, it is
manife$t, that the <I>F</I>orce D hath not
contra$ted with more then one half of the Weight G: But if the
<I>F</I>orce D do by benefit of the Leaver D C $u$tain the half of the
<foot>Weight</foot>
<p n=>289</p>
Weight G hanging at <I>F,</I> it hath been already demon$trated, that
the $aid <I>F</I>orce D hath to the Weight $o by it $u$tained, that $ame
proportion which the Di$tance <I>F</I> C hath to the Di$tance C D:
Which is $ubduple proportion: Therefore the Moment D is $ub-
duple to the Moment of half of the Weight G $u$tained by it:
Wherefore it followeth, that it is the fourth part of the Moment
of the whole Weight. And in the $ame manner the $ame thing is
demon$trated, of the Moment <I>B</I>; and it is but rea$onable, that the
Weight G being $u$tained by the four points, A, <I>B,</I> C, D, each of
them $hould feel an equall part of the Labour.</P>
<P>Let us come now to apply this Con$ideration to Pullies, and let
the Weight X be $uppo$ed to hang at the two Pullies A B and D E
entwining about them, and about the uppermo$t Pulley G H, the
Rope, as we $ee, I D E H G A B, $u$taining the whole Machine in
the point K. Now I $ay, that placing the Force in L, it $hall be able
to $u$tain the Weight X, if $o be, it be equal to the fourth part of
it. For if we do imagine the two Diameters D E and A B, and the
Weights hanging at the middle points F and C, we $hall have two
Leavers like to tho$e before de$cribed, the Fulciments of which an-
$wer to the points D and A. Whereupon the Force placed in B,
<fig>
or if you will, in L, $hall be able to $u-
$tain the Weight X, being the fourth
part of it: And if we adde another Pul-
ley above the other two, making the
Rope or Cord to pa$s along L M N, trans-
ferring the Force L into N, it $hall be
able to bear the $ame Weight gravitating
downwards, the upper Pulley neither aug-
menting or dimini$hing the Force, as hath
been declared. And we will likewi$e
note, that to make the: Weight a$cend the
<marg>* Or four parts
of the $ame Rope</marg>
four Ropes B L, E H, D I, and A G
ought to pa$s, whereupon the Mover will
be to begin, as much as tho$e Ropes are
long; and yet neverthele$s the Weight
$hall move but only as much as the length
of one of them: So that we may $ay by
way of adverti$ement, and for confirma-
tion of what hatn been many times $po-
ken, namely, that look with what proportion the Labour of the
<marg>* The word <I>Gy-
rilla</I> $ignifieth a
Shiver, Rundle,
or $mall Wheel
of a Pulley, tran-
$lated by we
$ometimes Pul-
ley, $ometimes
Nut or Girill.</marg>
Mover is dimini$hed, the length of the Way, on the contrary, is
encrea$ed with the $ame proportion</P>
<P>But if we would encrea$e the Force in $excuple proportion, it
will be requi$ite that we adjoyn another ^{*} $mall Pulley or Gyrill
to the inferiour Pulley which that you may the better under$tand
<foot>Pp we</foot>
<p n=>290</p>
we will $et before you the pre$ent Contemplation. Suppo$e, there-
fore, that A B, C D, and E F are three Leavers; and that on the
middle points of them G, H, and I the Weight K doth hang in
common, $o that every one of them $hall $u$tain the third part of
<fig>
it: And becau$e the Power in
B, $u$taining with the Leaver
B A thependent Weight in G,
hapneth to be the half of the
$aid Weight, and it hath been
already $aid, that it $u$taineth
the third part of the Weight
K: Therefore the Moment of
the Force B is equal to half of
the third part of the Weight K; that is, to the $ixth part of it:
And the $ame $hall be demon$trated of the other Forces D and F:
From whence we may ea$ily gather, that putting three Gyrils or
Rundles into the inferiour Pulley, and two or three into the upper-
<fig>
mo$t, we may multiply the Force accor-
<marg>* Or in Sexcuple
proportion.</marg>
ding to our ^{*} <I>Senarius.</I> And if we would
encrea$e it according to any other even
Number, the Gyrils of the Pulley below
mu$t be multiplyed according to the half
of that Number, according to which the
Force is to be multiplyed, circumpo$ing
the Rope about the Pulleys, $o as that one
of the ends be fa$tned to the upper Pul-
ley, and let the Force be in the other; as
in this Figure adjoyning may manife$tly
be gathered.</P>
<P>Now pa$$ing to the Declaration of the
manner how to multiply the Force ac-
cording to the odd Numbers, and begin-
<fig>
ning at the triple proportion: fir$t, let us
propo$e the pre$ent Contemplation, as
that, on the under$tanding of which the
knowledge of all the Work in hand
doth depend. Let therefore the Leaver
be A B, its Fulciment A, and from the
middle of it, that is, at the point C let
the Grave D be hanged; and let it be $u-
$tained by two equal Forces; and let one of them be applied to the
point C, and the other to the term B. I $ay, that each of tho$e Powers
have Moment equal to the third part of the Weight D. For the
Force in C $u$taineth a Weight equal to it $elf, being placed in the
$ame Line in which the Weight D doth hang &amp; Gravitate: But the
<foot>Force</foot>
<p n=>291</p>
Force in B $u$taineth a part of the Weight D double to it $elf, its
Di$tance from the Fulciment A, that is, the Line B A being dou-
ble to the Di$tance A C at which the Grave hangeth: But becau$e
the two Forces in B and C are $uppo$ed to be equal to each other:
Therefore the part of the Weight D, which is $u$tained by the
Force in B, is double to the part $u$tained by the Force in C. If
therefore, of the Grave D two parts be made, the one double to
the remainder, the greater is $u$tained by the Force in B, and the
le$$er by the Force in C: But this le$$er is the third part of the
Weight D: Therefore the Moment of the Force in C is equal to
the Moment of the third part of the Weight D; to which, of
con$equence, the Force B $hall be equal, we having $uppo$ed it
equal to the other Force C: Wherefore our intention is manifell,
which we were to demon$trate, how that each of the two Powers
C and B is equal to the third part of the Weight D. Which be-
ing demon$trated, we will pa$s forwards to the Pulleys, and will
de$cribe the inferiour Gyrils of A C B, voluble about the Center
G, and the Weight H hanging thereat, we will draw the other up-
per one E F, winding about them both the Rope D F E A C B I,
of which let the end D be fa$tned to the inferiour Pulley, and to
<fig>
the other I let the Force be applyed:
Which, I $ay, $u$taining or moving the
Weight H, $hall feele no more than the
third part of the Gravity of the $ame. For
con$idering the contrivance of this Ma-
chine, we $hall find that the Diameter A B
$upplieth the place of a Leaver, in who$e
term B the Force I is applied, and in the
other A the <I>F</I>uiciment is placed, at the mid-
dle G the Grave H is hanged, and another
<I>F</I>orce D applied at the $ame place: $o that
<marg>* Or three parts
of one Rope.</marg>
the Weight is fa$tned to the ^{*} three Ropes
I B, <I>F</I> D, and E A, which with equal Labour
$u$tain the Weight. Now, by what hath
already been contemplated, the two <I>F</I>orces
D and B being applied, one, to the mid$t of the Leaver A B, and
the other to the extream term B, it is manife$t, that each of them
holdeth no more but the third part of the Weight H: Therefore
the Power I, having a Moment equal to the third part of the
Weight H, $hall be able to $u$tain and move it: but yet the Way
of the <I>F</I>orce in I $hall be triple to the Way that the Weight $hall
pa$s; the $aid Force being to di$tend it $elf according to the
Length of the three Ropes I B, <I>F</I> D, and E A, of which one alone
mea$ureth the Way of the Weight H.</P>

<head><I>Of the</I> SCREW.</head>
<P>Among$t the re$t of Mechanick In$truments for $undry u$es
found out by the Wit of Man, the Screw doth, in my opi-
nion, both for Invention and for Utility, hold the fir$t
place, as that which is appo$itely accommodated, and $o contrived
not only to move, but al$o to $tay and pre$s with very great Force,
that taking up but little room, it worketh tho$e effects which other
In$truments cannot, unle$s they were reduced to a great Machine.
The Screw therefore being of mo$t ingenious and commodious
contrivance, we ought de$ervedly to be at $ome pains in explaining,
with all the plainne$s that is po$$ible, the Original and Nature of
it. The which that we may do, we will begin at a Speculation,
which, though at fir$t blu$h it may appear $omewhat remote from
the con$ideration of this In$trument, yet is the <I>Ba$is</I> and Founda-
tion thereof.</P>
<P>No doubt, but that Natures operation in the Motions of Grave
Bodies is $uch, that any whatever Body that hath a Gravity in it
hath a propen$ion of moving, being at liberty, towards the Cen-
<marg>* Or along.</marg>
ter, and that not only ^{*} by the Right Line perpendicularly, but al-
$o (when it cannot do otherwi$e) by any other Line, which ha-
ving $ome inclination towards the Center goeth more and more
aba$ing. And thus we $ee the Water not only to fall downwards
along the Perpendicular from $ome eminent place, but al$o to run
about the Surface of the Earth along Lines though very little en-
clined; as we $ee in the Cour$e of Rivers, the Waters of which, if $o
be that the Bed have any the lea$t declivity, go freely declining
downwards. Which very effect, like as it is di$cerned in all Fluid
Bodies, would appear al$o in hard Bodies, if $o be, that their Fi-
gure and other Accidental and Extern Impediments did not hinder
it. So that we, having a Superficies very well $moothed and poli-
$hed, as for in$tance, that of a Looking-gla$s, and a Ball exactly
rotund and $leek, either of Marble, or of Gla$s, or of any other
Matter apt to be poli$hed, this being placed upon that Superficies
$hall trundle along, in ca$e that this have any, though very $mall,
inclination; and $hall lie $till only upon that Superficies which is
exactly levelled and parallel to the Plane of the Horizon: as is
that, for example, of a Lake or $tanding Water being frozen, up-
on which the $aid Spherical Body would $tand $till, but in a con-
dition of being moved by every $mall Force. For we having $up-
po$ed that if that Plane did incline but an hairs breadth only, the
$aid Ball would move along it $pontaneou$ly towards the part de-
clining, and on the oppo$ite would have a Re$i$tance, nay, would
not be able without $ome Violence to move towards the part
<foot>ri$ing</foot>
<p n=>293</p>
ri$ing or a$cending: it of nece$$ity remaineth manife$t, that in the
Superficies which is exactly equilibrated, the $aid Ball remaineth in-
different and dubious between Motion and Re$t, $o that every $mall
Force is $ufficient to move it, as on the contrary, every $mall Re$i-
$tance, and no greater than that of the meer Air that environs it, is
able to hold it $till.</P>
<P>From whence we may take this Conclu$ion for indubitable, That
Crave Bodies, all Extern and Adventitious Impediments being re-
moved, may be moved along the Plane of the Horizon by any ne-
ver $o $mall Force: but when the $ame Grave is to be thrown along
an A$cending Plane, then, it beginning to $trive again$t that a$cent,
having an inclination to the contrary Motion, there $hall be requi-
red greater Violence, and $till greater the more Elevation that $ame
Plane $hall have. As for example, the Moveable G, being po$ited
upon the Line A B parallel to the Horizon, it $hall, as hath been
$aid, be indifferent on it either to Motion or Re$t, $o that it may
be moved by a very $mall Force: But if we $hall have the Planes
Elevated, they $hall not be driven along without Violence; which
<fig>
Violence will be required to be
greater to move it along the Line
A D, than along A C; and $till
greater along A E than along A D:
The which hapneth, becau$e it hath
greater <I>Impetus</I> of going down-
wards along A E than along A D,
and along A D than along A C. So
that we may likewi$e conclude
Grave Bodies to have greater Re$i$tance upon Planes differently
Elevared, to their being moved along the $ame, according as one
$hall be more or le$s elevated than the other; and, in fine, that the
greate$t Re$i$tance of the $ame Grave to its being rai$ed is in the
Perpendicular A F. But it will be nece$$ary to declare exactly what
proportion the Force mu$t have to the Weight, that it may be able
to carry it along $everal elevated Planes, before we proceed any
farther, to the end that we may perfectly under$tand all that which
remains to be $poken.</P>
<P>Letting, therefore, Perpendiculars fall from the points C, D,
and E unto the Horizontal Line A B, which let be C H, D I, and
E K: it $hall be demon$trated that the $ame Weight $hall be mo-
ved along the Plane A C with le$$er Force than along the Perpendi-
cular A F, (where it is rai$ed by a Force equal to it $elf) accor-
ding to the proportion by which the Perpendicular C H is le$s than
A C: and that along the Plane A D, the Force hath the $ame pro-
portion to the Weight, that the Perpendicular I D hath to D A:
and, la$tly, that in the Plane A E the <I>F</I>orce to the Weight ob$er-
veth the proportion of E K and E A.</P>
<foot>The</foot>
<p n=>294</p>
<P>The pre$ent Speculation hath been attempted by <I>Pappus Alex-
andrinus</I> in <I>Lib.</I> 8. <I>de Collection. Mathemat.</I> but, if I be in the
right, he hath not hit the mark, and was over$een in the A$$umpti-
on that he maketh, where he $uppo$eth that the Weight ought to
be moved along the Horizontal Line by a <I>F</I>orce given; which is
fal$e: there needing no $en$ible <I>F</I>orce (removing the Accidental
Impediments, which in the Theory are not regarded) to move the
given Weight along the Horizon, $o that he goeth about in vain
afterwards to $eek with what <I>F</I>orce it is to be moved along the
elevated Plane. It will be therefore better, the <I>F</I>orce that moveth
the Weight upwards perpendicularly, (which equalizeth the Gra-
vity of that Weight which is to be moved) being given, to
$eek the <I>F</I>orce that moveth it along the Elevated Plane: Which
we will endeavour to do in a Method different from that of
<I>Pappus.</I></P>
<P>Let us therefore $uppo$e the Circle A I C, and in it the Diame-
ter A B C, and the Center B, and two Weights of equal Moment
in the extreams B and C; $o that the Line A C being a Leaver,
or Ballance moveable about the Center B, the Weight C $hall
come to be $u$tained by the Weight A. But if we $hall imagine
the Arm of the Ballance B C to be inclined downwards according
to the Line B F, but yet in $uch a manner that the two Lines <I>A B</I>
and <I>B F</I> do continue $olidly conjoyned in the point <I>B,</I> in this ca$e
the Moment of the Weight C $hall not be equal to the Moment
<fig>
of the Weight <I>A,</I> for that the Di-
$tance of the point <I>F</I> from the Line
of Direction, which goeth accord-
ing to B I, from the <I>F</I>ulciment B un-
to the Center of the Earth, is dimi-
ni$hed: But if from the point <I>F</I> we
erect a Perpendicular unto B C, as is
<I>F</I> K, the Moment of the Weight in
<I>F</I> $hall be as if it did hang by the
Line K <I>F,</I> and look how much the
Di$tance K B is dimini$hed by the
Di$tance B <I>A,</I> $o much is the Moment of the Weight <I>F</I> dimini$hed
by the Moment of the <I>W</I>eight <I>A. A</I>nd in this fa$hion inclining
the <I>W</I>eight more, as for in$tance, according to B L, its Moment $hall
$till dimini$h and $hall be as if it did hang at the Di$tance <I>B</I> M, ac-
cording to the <I>L</I>ine M <I>L,</I> in which point <I>L</I> it $hall be $u$tained by
a <I>W</I>eight placed in <I>A,</I> $o much le$s than it $elf, by how much the
Di$tance B <I>A</I> is greater than the Di$tance <I>B</I> M. See therefore that
the <I>W</I>eight placed in the extream of the <I>L</I>eaver B C, in inclining
downwards along the Circumference C <I>F L</I> I, cometh to dimini$h
its Moment and <I>Impetus</I> of going downwards from time to time,
<foot>more</foot>
<p n=>295</p>
more and le$s, as it is more or le$s $u$tained by the Lines B F and
B L: But the con$idering that this Grave de$cending, and $u$tained
by the Semidiameters B F and B L is one while le$s, and another
while more con$trained to pa$s along the Circumference C F L, is
no other, than if we $hould imagine the $ame Circumference
C F L I to be a Super$icies $o curved, and put under the $ame
Moveable: $o that bearing it $elf thereon it were con$trained to
de$cend along thereby; for if in the one and other manner the
Moveable de$cribeth the $ame Cour$e or Way, it will nothing im-
port whether, if $u$pended at the Center B, it is $u$tained by the
Semidiameter of the Circle, or el$e, whether that Fulciment being
taken away, it proceed along the Circumference C F L I: So that
we may confidently affirm, that the Grave de$cending downwards
from the point C along the Circumference C F L I, its Moment
of De$cent in the point C is total and entire, becau$e it is not in
any part $u$tained by the Circumference: And there is not in that
fir$t point C, any indi$po$ition to Motion different from that, which
being at liberty, it would make along the Perpendicular and Con-
tingent Line D C E: But if the Moveable $hall be placed in the
point F, then its Gravity is in part $u$tained, and its Moment of
De$cent is dimini$hed by the Circular Path or Way that is placed
under it, in that proportion wherewith the <I>L</I>ine <I>B</I> K is overcome
by <I>B</I> C: But if when the Moveable is in F, at the fir$t in$tant of
$uch its Motion, it be as if it were in the Plane elevated according
to the Contingent <I>L</I>ine G F H, for that rea$on the inclination of the
Circumference in the point F differeth not from the inclination of
the Contingent <I>L</I>ine F G any more $ave the in$en$ible Angle of
the Contact. And in the $ame manner we $hall find the Moment
of the $aid Moveable to dimini$h in the point <I>L,</I> as the <I>L</I>ine BM
is dimini$hed by B C; $o that in the Plane contingent to the Circle
in the point <I>L,</I> as for in$tance, according to the <I>L</I>ine N <I>L</I> O, the
Moment of De$cent dimini$heth in the Moveable with the $ame
proportion. If therefore ^{*} upon the Plane HG the Moment of the
<marg>* Or along</marg>
Moveable be dimini$hed by the total <I>Impetus</I> which it hath in its
Perpendicular D C E, according to the proportion of the <I>L</I>ine K B
to the <I>L</I>ine B C, and B F, being by the Solicitude of the Triangles
K B F and K F H the $ame proportion betwixt the <I>L</I>ines K F and
F H, as betwixt the $aid K B and <I>B</I> F, we will conclude that the
proportion of the entire and ab$olute Moment, that the Moveable
hath in the Perpendicular to the Horizon to that which it hath up-
on the Inclined Plane H F, hath the $ame proportion that the
<I>L</I>ine H F hath to the <I>L</I>ine F K; that is, that the <I>L</I>ength of the
Inclined Plane hath to the Perpendicular which $hall fall from it
unto the Horizon. So that pa$$ing to a more di$tinct Figure, $uch
as this here pre$ent, the Moment of De$cending which the Move-
<foot>able</foot>
<p n=>296</p>
able hath upon the inclined Plane C A hath to its total Moment
wherewith it gravitates in the Perpendicular to the Horizon C P the
$ame proportion that the $aid Line P C hath to C A. And if thus it
be, it is manife$t, that like as the Force that $u$tai-
neth the Weight in the Perpendiculation P C ought
<fig>
to be equal to the $ame, $o for $u$taining it in the
inclined Plane C A, it will $uffice that it be $o much
le$$er, by how much the $aid Perpendicular C P wan-
teth of the Line C A: and becau$e, as $ometimes we
$ce, it $ufficeth, that the Force for moving of the
Weight do in$en$ibly $uperate that which $u$taineth it, therefore
we will infer this univer$al Propo$ition, [That upon an Elevated
Plane the Force hath to the Weight the $ame proportion, as the
Perpendicular let fall from the Plane unto the Horizon hath to the
Length of the $aid Plane.]</P>
<P>Returning now to our fir$t Intention, which was to inve$tigate
the Nature of the Screw, we will con$ider the Triangle A B C, of
which the Line A B is Horizontal, B C perpendicular to the $aid
Horizon, and A C a Plane elevated; upon which the Moveable D
$hall be drawn by a Force $o much le$s than it, by how much the
Line B C is $horter than C A: But to elevate or rai$e the $aid
Weight along the $aid Plane A C, is as much as if the Triangle
C A B $tanding $till, the Weight
<fig>
D be moved towards C, which is
the $ame, as if the $ame Weight
never removing from the Perpen-
dicular A E, the Triangle did
pre$s forwards towards H. For if
it were in the Site F H G, the
Moveable would be found to
have mounted the height A I.
Now, in fine, the primary Form and E$$ence of the Screw is no-
thing el$e but $uch a Triangle A C B, which being forced for-
wards, $hall work it $elf under the Grave Body to be rai$ed, and
lifteth it up, as we $ay, by the ^{*} head and $houlders. And this was
<marg><I>Levar in cape</I>
<*> $ieth to lift
<*> igh by force</marg>
its fir$t Original: For its fir$t Inventor (whoever he was) con$i-
dering how that the Triangle A B C going forwards rai$eth the
Weight D, he might have framed an In$trument like to the $aid
Triangle, of a very $olid Matter, which being thru$t forwards did
rai$e up the propo$ed Weight: But afterwards con$idering better,
how that that $ame Machine might be reduced into a much le$$er
and more commodious Form, taking the $ame Triangle he twined
and wound it about the Cylinder A B C D in $uch a fa$hion, that
the height of the $aid Triangle, that is the Line C B, did make the
Height of the Cylinder, and the A$cending Plane did beget upon
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>297</p>
the $aid Cylinder the Helical Line de$cribed by the Line AEFGH,
which we vulgarly call the Wale of the Screw, which was produ-
ced by the Line A C. And in this manner is the In$trument made,
which is by the Greeks called <G>*ko/xlos,</G> and by us a Screw; which
<marg>* <G>*ko/xlos,</G> in La-
tine <I>Cocblea,</I> any
Screw winding
like the Shell of
a Snail.</marg>
winding about
cometh to work
<fig>
and in$inu-
ate with its
Wales under
the Weight, and
with facility rai-
$eth it. And we
having demon-
$trated, That up-
on [<I>or along</I>]
the elevated Plane the Force hath the $ame proportion to the
Weight, that the perpendicular Altitude of the $aid Plane hath to
its Length; $o, $uppo$ing that the Force in the Screw A B C D is
multiplied according to the proportion by which the Length of the
whole Wale exceedeth the Altitude C B, from hence we come
to know that making the Screw with its Helix's more thick or clo$e
together, it becometh $o much the more forceable, as being begot
by a Plane le$s elevated, and who$e Length regards its own Per-
pendicular Altitude with greater proportion. But we will not
omit to adverti$e you, that de$iring to find the Force of a propo-
$ed Screw, it will not be needful that we mea$ure the Length of
all its Wales, and the Altitude of the whole Cylinder, but it
will be enough if we $hall but examine how many times the Di-
$tance betwixt two $ingle and Contiguous terms do enter into one
$ole Turn of the $ame Wale, as for example, how many times
the Di$tance AF is contained in the Length of the Turn AEF:
For this is the $ame proportion that the Altitude CB hath to all
the Wale.</P>
<P>If all that be under$tood which we have hitherto $poken touch-
ing the Nature of this In$trument, I do not doubt in the lea$t but
that all the other circum$tances may without difficulty be compre-
hended: as for in$tance, that in$teed of making the Weight to
mount upon the Screw if one accommodates its Nut with
the Helix incavated or made hollow, into which the Male Screw
that is the Wale entring, &amp; then being turned round it rai$eth and
lifteth up the Nut or Male Screw together with the Weight which
was hanged thereat. La$tly, we are not to pa$s over that Con$idera-
tion with $ilence which at the beginning hath been $aid to be nece$-
$ary for us to have in all Mechanick In$truments, to wit, That
what is gained in Force by their a$$i$tance, is lo$t again in Time,
<foot>Qq and</foot>
<p n=>298</p>
and in the Velocity: which peradventure, might not have $eemed
to $ome $o true and manife$t in the pre$ent Contemplation; nay,
rather it $eems, that in this ca$e the Force is multiplied without the
Movers moving a longer way than the Moveable: In regard, that
if we $hall in the Triangle A B C $uppo$e the Line A B to be the
Plane of the Horizon, A C the elevated Plane, who$e Altitude is
mea$ured by the Perpendicular C B, a Moveable placed upon the
Plane A C, and the Cord E D <I>F</I> tyed to it, and a <I>F</I>orce or Weight
applyed in <I>F</I> that hath to the
Gravity of the Weight E the
<fig>
$ame proportion that the Line
B C hath to C A; by what
hath been demon$trated, the
Weight <I>F</I> $hall de$cend
downwards, drawing the
Moveable E along the eleva-
ted Plane; nor $hall the Move-
able E mea$ure a greater Space
when it $hall have pa$$ed the
whole Line A <I>C,</I> than that which the $aid Grave <I>F</I> mea$ureth in its
de$cent downwards. But here yet it mu$t be adverti$ed, that al-
though the Moveable E $hall have pa$$ed the whole Line A C, in
the $ame Time that the other Grave <I>F</I> $hall have been aba$ed the
like Space, neverthele$s the Grave E $hall not have retired from the
common Center of things Grave more than the Space of the Per-
pendicular <I>C</I> B. but yet the Grave <I>F</I> de$cending Perpendicularly $hall
be aba$ed a Space equal to the whole Line A <I>C.</I> And becau$e Grave
Bodies make no Re$i$tance to Tran$ver$al Motions, but only $o
far as they happen to recede from the <I>C</I>enter of the Earth; There-
fore the Moveable E in all the Motion A <I>C</I> being rai$ed no more
than the length of the Line <I>C</I>B, but the other <I>F</I> being aba$ed per-
pendicularly the quantity of all the Line A <I>C</I>: Therefore we may

<head><I>Of the SCREW of</I> ARCHIMEDES
<I>to draw Waier.</I></head>
<P>I Do not think it $it in this place to pa$s over with Silence the
Invention of <I>Archimedes</I> to rai$e Wa er with the Screw, which
is not only marvellous, but miraculous: for we $hall find that
the Water a$cendeth in the Screw continually de$cending; and in
a given Time, with a given Force doth rai$e an un$peakable quan-
tity therof. But before we proceed any farther, let us declare the u$e
of the Screw in making Water to ri$e: And in the en$uing Figure,
let us con$ider the Line I L O P Q
<fig>
R S H being wrapped or twined
about the Collumn M I K H,
which Line you are to $uppo$e to
be a Chanel thorow which the
Water may run: If we $hall put
the end I into the Water, making
the Screw to $tand leaning, $o as
the point L may be lower than
the fir$t I, as the Diagram $hew-
eth, and $hall turn it round about
on the two Axes, T and V, the Water $hall run thorow the Cha-
nel, till that in the end it $hall di$charge $orth at the mouth H.
Now I $ay, that the Water, in its conveyance from the point I to
the point H, doth go all the way de$cending, although the point H
be higher than the point I. Which that it is $o, we will declare
in this manner. We will de$cribe the Triangle A C B, which is
that of which the Screw H I is generated, in $uch $ort that the
Chanel of the Screw is repre$ented by the Line A C, who$e
A$cent and Elevation is determined by the Angle C A B; that is
to $ay, if $o be, that that Angle $hall be the third or fourth part of a
Right Angle, then the Elevation of the Chanel A C $hall be ac-
cording to 1/3, or 1/4 of a Right Angle. And it is manife$t; that the
Ri$e of that $ame Chanel A C will be taken away deba$ing the
point C as far as to B: for then the Chanel A C $hall have no
Elevation. And deba$ing the point C a little below B, the Water
will naturally run along the Chanel A C downwards from the
point A towards C. Let us therefore conclude, that the Angle A
being 1/3 of a Right Angle, the Chanel A C $hall no longer have any
Ri$e, deba$ing it on the part <I>C</I> for 1/3 of a Right Angle.</P>
<P>The$e things under$tood, let us infold the Triangle about the
Column, and let us make the Screw B A E F G, &amp;c. which if it
$hall be placed at Right Angles with the end B in the Water, turn-
ing it about, it $hall not this way draw up the Water, the Chanel
about the Column being elevated, as may be $een by the part B A<*>
<foot>Qq 2 But</foot>
<p n=>300</p>
But although the Column $tand erect at Right-Angles, yet for all
that, the Ri$e along the Screw, folded about the Column, is not of
a greater Elevation than of 1/3 of a Right Angle, it being generated
by the Elevation of the Chanel A C: Therefore if we incline the
Column but 1/3 of the
<fig>
$aid Right Angle, and
a little more, as we $ee
I K H M, there is a
Tran$ition and Moti-
on along the Chanel
I L: Therefore the
Water from the point
I to the point L $hall
move de$cending, and
the Screw being turned
about, the other parts
of it $hall $ucce$$ively
di$po$e or pre$ent
them$elves to the Wa-
ter in the $ame Po$ition as the part I L: Whereupon the Water
$hall go $ucce$$ively de$cending, and in the end $hall be found to
be a$cended from the point I to the point H. Which how admira-
ble a thing it is, I leave $uch to judge who $hall perfectly have un-
der$tood it. And by what hath been $aid, we come to know, That
the Screw for rai$ing of Water ought to be inclined a little more
than the quantity of the Angle of the Triangle by which the $aid
Screw is de$cribed.</P>
<head><I>Of the Force of the
HAMMER, MALLET, or BEETLE.</I></head>
<P>The Inve$tigation of the cau$e of the Force of the$e Percuti-
ents is nece$$ary for many Rea$ons: and fir$t, becau$e that
there appeareth in it much more matter of admiration than
is ob$erved in any other Mechanick In$trument what$oever. For
$triking with the Hammer upon a Nail, which is to be driven into
a very tough Po$t, or with the Beetle upon a Stake that is to pene-
trate into very $tiffe ground, we $ee, that by the $ole vertue of the
blow of the Percutient both the one and the other is thru$t for-
wards: $o that without that, only laying the Beetle upon the
Nail or Stake it will not move then, nay, more, although you
$hould lay upon them a Weight very much heavier than the $aid
Beetle. An effect truly admirable, and $o much the more worthy
of Contemplation, in that, as I conceive, none of tho$e who have
<foot>hitherto</foot>
<p n=>301</p>
hitherto di$cour$ed upon it, have $aid any thing that hits the mark;
which we may take for a certain Sign and Argument of the Ob$cu-
rity and difficulty of this <I>S</I>peculation. For <I>Ari$totle,</I> or others,
who would reduce the cau$e of this admirable Effect unto the
length of the <I>Manubrium,</I> or Handle, may, in my judgement, be
made to $ee their mi$take in the effect of tho$e In$truments, which
having no Handle, yet percu$s, either in falling from on high
downwards, or by being thrown with Velocity $idewaies. There-
fore it is requi$ite, that we have recour$e to $ome other Principle, if
we would find out the truth of this bu$ine$s; the cau$e of which,
although it be of its own nature $omewhat ob$cure, and of diffi-
cult con$ideration, yet neverthele$s we will attempt with the grea-
te$t per$picuity po$$ible to render it clear and obvious, $hewing, for
a clo$e of all, that the Principle and Original of this Effect is deri-
ved from no other Fountain than this, from which the rea$ons of all
other Mechanick Effects do proceed: and this we will do, by $etting
before your eyes that very thing which is $een to befall in every
other Mechanick Operation, <I>$cilicet,</I> That the Force, the Re$i$tance,
and the Space by which the Motion is made, do go alternately
with $uch proportion operating, and with $uch a rate an$wering to
each other, that a Re$i$tance, equal to the Force, $hall be moved by
the $aid Force along an equal Space, with Velocity equal to that
with which it is moved. Likewi$e, That a Force that is le$s by half
than a Re$i$tance $hall be able to move it, $o that it be moved
with double Velocity, or, if you will, for a Di$tance twice as great
as that which the moved Re$i$tance $hall pa$s: and, in a word, it
hath been $een in all the other In$truments, that any, never $o great,
Re$i$tance may be moved by every $mall Force given, provided,
that the Space, along which the Re$i$tance $hall move, have the
$ame proportion that is found to be betwixt the $aid great Re$i-
$tance and the Force: and that this is according to the nece$$ary
Order and Con$titution of Nature: So that inverting the Di$cour$e,
and Arguing the contrary way, what wonder $hall it be, if that
Power that $hall move a $mall Re$i$tance a great way, $hall carry
one an hundred times bigger an hundredth part of that Di$tance?
Certainly none at all: nay, it would be ab$urd, yea, impo$$ible
that it $hould be otherwi$e. Let us therefore con$ider, what the
Re$i$tance of the Beetle unto Motion may be in that point where
it is to $trike, and how far, if it do not $trike, it would be carryed
by the received Force beyond that point: and again, what Re$i-
$tance to Motion there is in him who $triketh, and how much by
that $ame Percu$$ion he is moved: and, having found that this
great Re$i$tance goeth forwards by a percu$$ion $o much le$s than
the Beetle driven by the <I>Impetus</I> of him that moveth it would do,
by how much that $ame great Re$i$tance is greater than that of
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>302</p>
the Beetle; we $hall cea$e to wonder at the Effect, which doth not
in the lea$t exceed the terms of Natural Con$titutions, and of
what hath been $poken. Let us, for better under$tanding, give an
example thereof in particular Terms. There is a Beetle, which ha-
ving four degrees of Re$i$tance, is moved by $uch a Force, that
being freed from it in that term where it maketh the Percu$$ion, it
would, meeting with no $top, go ten Paces beyond it, and in that
term a great po$t being oppo$ed to it, who$e Re$i$tance to Moti-
on is as four thou$and, that is, a thou$and times greater than that of
the Beetle, (but yet is not immoveable) $o that it without mea-
$ure or proportion exceeds the Re$i$tance of the Beetle, yet the
Percu$$ion being made on it, it $hall be driven forwards, though in-
deed no more but the thou$andth part of the ten Paces which the
Beetle $hall be moved: and thus in an inverted method, changing
that which hath been $poken touching the other Mechanical Effects,
we may inve$tigate the rea$on of the Force of the Percutient. I
know that here ari$e difficulties and objections unto $ome, which
they will not ea$ily be removed from, but we will freely remit them

<head>THE

<head>In which, in immitation of <I>Archimedes</I> in the
Problem of the Crown, he $heweth how to
find the proportion of the Alloy of
Mixt-Metals; and how to make
the $aid In$trument.</head>
<P>As it is well known, by $uch who take the pains to read
old Authors, that <I>Archimedes</I> detected the Cheat of

<marg>* King of <I>Sicily,</I>

to it $uch another Ma$s of pure Gold, and another of Silver $eve-
rally, and that from the differences in their making the Water
more or le$s ri$e and run over, he came to know the Mixture or
Alloy of the Gold with the Silver, of which that Crown was
compounded; $eems a thing (if I may $peak it) very gro$s, and
far from exactne$s. And it will $eem $o much the more dull to
$uch who have read and under$tood the exqui$ite Inventions of $o
Divine a Man among$t the Memorials that are extant of him; by
which it is very manife$t that all other Wits are inferiour to that
of <I>Archimedes.</I> Indeed I believe, that Fame divulging it abroad,
that <I>Archimedes</I> had di$covered that $ame Fraud by means of the
Water, $ome Writer of tho$e Times committed the memory there-
of to P<*>$terity, and that this per$on, that he might add $omething
to that little which he had heard by common Fame, did relate that
<I>Archimedes</I> had made u$e of the Water in that manner, as $ince
hath been by the generality of men believed.</P>
<P>But in regard I know, that that method is altogether fallacious,
and falls $hort of that exactne$s which is required in Mathematical
Matters, I have often thought in what manner, by help of the
Water, one might exactly find the Mixture of two Metals, and
in the end, after I had diligently peru$ed that which <I>Archimedes</I>
demon$trateth in his Books <I>De in$iden<*>bus aqu&aelig;,</I> and tho$e others
<foot><I>De</I></foot>
<p n=>304</p>
<I>De &aelig;quiponder antium,</I> there came into my thoughts a Rule which
exqui$itely re$olveth our Que$tion; which Rule I believe to be
the $ame that <I>Archimedes</I> made u$e of, $eeing that be$ides the
u$e that is to be made of the Water, the exactne$s of the Work
dependeth al$o upon certain Demon$trations found by the $aid
<I>Archimedes.</I></P>
<P>The way is by help of a Ballance, who$e Con$truction and U$e
$hall be $hewn by and by, after we $hall have declared what is
nece$$ary for the knowledge thereof. You mu$t know there-
fore, that the Solid Bodies that $ink in the Water weigh $o much
le$s in the Water than in the Air, as a Ma$s of Water equal to
the $aid Solid doth weigh in the Air: which hath been demon-
$trated by <I>Archimedes.</I> But, in regard his Demon$tration is very
mediate, becau$e I would not be over long, laying it a$ide, I $hall
declare the $ame another way. Let us con$ider, therefore, that
putting into the Water <I>v. g.</I> a Ma$s of Gold, if that Ma$s were
of Water it would have no weight at all: For the Water moveth
neither upwards, nor downwards in the Water: It remains,
therefore, that the Ma$s of Gold weigheth in the Water only $o
much as the Gravity of the Gold exceeds the Gravity of the Wa-
ter. And the like is to be under$tood of other Metals. And be-
cau$e the Metals are different from each other in Gravity, their
Gravity in the Water $hall dimini$h according to $everal proporti-
ons. As for example: Let us $uppo$e that Gold weigheth twenty
times more than Water, it is manife$t by that which hath been
$poken, that the Gold will weigh le$s in the Water than in the
Air by a twentieth part of its whole weight. Now, let us $uppo$e
that Silver, as being le$s Grave than Gold, weigheth 12 times more
than Water: this then, being weighed in the Water, $hall di-
mini$h in Gravity the twelfth part of its whole weight. Therefore
the Gravity of Gold in the Water decrea$eth le$s than that of
Silver; for that dimini$heth a twentieth part, and this a twelfth.
If therefore in an exqui$ite Ballance we $hall hang a Metal at the
one Arm, and at the other a Counterpoi$e that weigheth equally
with the $aid Metal in the Water, leaving the Counterpoi$e in the
Air, to the end that it may equivalate and compen$ate the Me-
tal, it will be nece$$ary to hang it nearer the Perpendicular or
Cook. As for example, Let the Ballance be A B, its Perpendicu-
<fig>
lar C, and let a
Ma$s of $ome
Metal be $u-
$pended at B,
counterpoi$edby
the Weight D: putting the Weight B into the Water, the
Weight D in A would weigh more: therefore that they may
<foot>weigh</foot>
<p n=>305</p>
weigh equally it would be nece$$ary to hang it nearer to the
Perpendicular C, as <I>v. gr.</I> in E: and look how many times the Di-
$tance C A $hall contain A E, $o many times $hall the Metal
weigh more than the Water. Let us therefore $uppo$e that the
Weight in B be Gold, and that weighed in the Water it with-
draws the Counterpoi$e D into E; and then doing the $ame with
pure Silver, let us $uppo$e that its Counterpoi$e, when afterwards
it is weighed in the Water, returneth to F: which point $hall be
nearer to the point C, as Experience $heweth, becau$e the Silver
is le$s grave than the Gold: And the Di$tance that is between
A and F $hall have the $ame Difference with the Di$tance A E,
that the Gravity of the Gold hath with that of the Silver. But if
we have a Mixture of Gold and Silver, it is clear, that by rea$on it
participates of Silver, it $hall weigh le$s than the pure Gold, and
by rea$on it participates of Gold, it $hall weigh more than the
pure Silver: and therefore being weighed in the Air, and de$iring
that the $ame Counterpoi$e $hould counterpoi$e it, when that
Mixture $hall be put into the Water it will be nece$$ary to draw
the $aid Counterpoi$e more towards the Perpendicular C, than the
point E is, which is the term of the Gold; and more from C
than F is, which is the term of the pure Silver; Therefore it $hall
fall between the points E and F: And the proportion into which
the Di$tance EF $hall be divided, $hall exactly give the proportion
of the two Metals which compound that Mixture. As for exam-
ple: Let us $uppo$e the Mixture of Gold and Silver to be in B,
<fig>
counterpoi$ed in
the Air by D,
which Counter-
poi$e when the
Compound Me-
tal is put into the Water returneth into G: I $ay now, that the
Gold and the Silver which compound this Mixture are to one ano-
ther in the $ame proportion, as the Di$tance F G is to the Di$tance
G E. But you mu$t know that the Di$tance G F terminated in
the mark of the Silver, $hall denote unto us the quantity of the
Gold, and the Di$tance G E, terminated in the mark of the Gold,
$hall $hew us the quantity of the Silver: in$omuch that if F G
$hall prove double to G E, then that Mixture $hall be two parts
Gold, and one part Silver: and in the $ame method proceeding i<*>
the examination of other Mixtures, one $hall exactly find the
quantity of the $imple Metals.</P>
<P>To compo$e the Ballance, therefore, take a Rod at lea$t a yard
long, (and the longer it is, the exacter the In$trument $hall be)
and divide it in the mid$t, where place the Perpendicular: then
adju$t the Arms that they may $tand in <I>Equilibrium,</I> by filing or
<foot>Rr $having</foot>
<p n=>306</p>
$having that le$s which weigheth mo$t; and upon one of the Arms
note the terms to which the Counterpoi$es of $imple Metals return
when they $hall be weighed in the Water: taking care to weigh the
pure$t Metals that can be found. This being done, it remaineth
that we find out a way, how we may with facility di$cover the
proportion, according to which, the Di$tances between the terms
of the $imple and pure Metals are divided by the Marks of the
Mixt Metals: Which $hall be effected in this manner.</P>
<P>We are to have two very $mall Wires drawn thorow the $ame
drawing-Iron, one of Steel, the other of Bra$s, and above the
terms of the $imple Metals we mu$t wind the Steel Wyer; as for
example: above the point E, the term of the pure Gold, we are
to wind the Steel Wyer, and under it the other Bra$s Wyre, and
having made ten folds of the Steel Wyer, we mu$t make ten
more with that of Bra$s, and thus we are to continue to do with
ten of Steel, and ten of Bra$s, until that the whole Space be-
tween the points E and F, the terms of the pure Metals, be full;
cau$ing tho$e two terms to be alwaies vi$ible and per$picuous:
and thus the Di$tance E F $hall be divided into many equal parts,
and numbred by ten and ten. And if at any time we would know
the proportion that is between F G and G E, we mu$t count the
Wyers F G, and the Wyers G E: and finding the Wyers F G
to be, for example, 40, and the Wyers G E, 21: we will $ay that
there is in the mixt Metal 40 parts of Gold, and 21 of Silver. But
here you mu$t note, that there is $ome difficulty in the counting,
for tho$e Wyers being very $mall, as it is requi$ite for exactne$s
$ake, it is not po$$ible with the eye to tell them, becau$e the
$malne$s of the Spaces dazleth &amp; confoundeth the Sight. Therefore
to number them with facility, take a Bodkin as $harp as a Needle
and $et it into an handle, or a very fine pointed Pen-knife, with
which we may ea$ily run over all the $aid Wyers, and this way
partly by help of hearing, partly by the impediments the hand
$hall feel at every Wyer, tho$e Wyers $hall be counted;
the number of which, as I $aid before, $hall give us the exact
quantity of the $unple Metals, of which the Mixt-Metal is com-
pounded: taking notice that the Simple an$wer alternately to the
Di$tances. As for example, in a Mixture of Gold and Silver,
the Wyers that $hall be towards the term of Gold $hall $hew us
the quantity of the Silver: And the $ame is to be under$tood of
other Metals.</P>
<foot>Annotations</foot>
<p n=>307</p>
<head>Annotations of <I>Dominico Mantovani</I> upon the Bal-
lance of <I>Signore Galileo Galilei.</I></head>
<P>Fir$t, I conceive that the difficulty of Numbring the Wyres
is removed by wrapping about the Ballance ten of Steel,
and then ten of Bra$s, which being divided by tens, there
only remains that tenth part to be numbred, in which the term
of the Mixt Metal falleth. For although <I>Signore Galileo,</I> who is
Author of this Invention, makes mention of two Wyres, one of
Steel, the other of Bra$s, yet he doth not $ay, that we are to
take ^{*} ten of the one, and ten of the other: which it may be
<marg>* <I>Galileus</I> $aith it
expre$ly in this
Copy which I fol-
low, but might
omit it in the Co-
py which came to
the hands of <I>Man-
tovani.</I></marg>
hapneth by the negligence of him that hath tran$cribed it; al-
though I mu$t confe$s that the Copy which came to my hands was
of his own writing.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is $uppo$ed in this Problem that the Compo$ition
of two Metals do retain the $ame proportion of Ma$s in the
Mixture as the two Simple Metals, of which it is compounded,
had at fir$t. I mean, that the Simple Metals retain and keep in
the Compo$ition (after that they are incorporated and commix-
ed) the $ame proportion in Ma$s that the Simple Metals had
when they were $eparated: Which in the Ca$e of <I>Signore Gali-
leo,</I> touching the Commixtion of Gold and Silver, I do neither
deny, nor particularly confe$s. But if one would, for example,
unite 101 pounds of Copper with 21 pounds of Tin, to make
thereof 120 pounds of Bell-Metal, (I abate two pounds,
$uppo$ed to be wa$ted in the Melting) I do think that 120
pounds of Compound Metal will have a le$s Bulk than the 100
pounds of pure Copper, and the 20 pounds of Tin unmixt, that
is, before they were incorporated and melted into one Ma$s, and
that the Compo$ition is more grave <I>in Specie</I> than the $ingle Cop-
per, and the $ingle Bra$s: and in the Ca$e of <I>Signore Galileo</I> the
Compo$ition of Gold and Silver is $uppo$ed to be lighter <I>in Specie</I>
than the pure Gold, and heavier <I>in Specie</I> than the pure Silver. Of
which it would be ea$ie to make $ome $uch like experiment, melt-
ing together, <I>v. gr.</I> 10 pounds of Lead with 5 pounds of Tin,
and ob$erving whether tho$e 15 pounds, or whatever the Mixture
maketh, do give the difference betwixt the weight in the Water
to the weight in the Air, in the proportion that the 15 pounds of
the two Metals di$-united gave before: I do not $ay, the $ame diffe-
rence, becau$e I pre $uppo$e that they will wa$te in melting down,
and that the Compound will be le$s than 15 pounds, therefore I
$ay in proportion.</P>
<P>Thirdly, He doth al$o $uppo$e, that one ought to take the
<foot>Rr 2 Simple</foot>
<p n=>308</p>
Simple Metals, that is, the Gold and the Silver, each of the $ame
weight as the Mixture, although he doth not $ay $o; which may
be collected in that he marketh the ballance only betwixt the
Terms of the Gold and the Silver, which is the cau$e of the great
facility in re$olving the Problem by only counting the
Wyers.</P>
<P>One might take the pure Gold, and pure Silver of the $ame
weight, in re$pect of one another, but yet different from the
weight of the Mixture, that is, either more or le$s grave than the
Mixt Metal: and being equal in weight to one another they
might $hew the proportion of the Ma$s of the Gold to that of the
Silver; but yet with this difference, that the more grave will $hew
the $aid proportion more exactly than the $mall and le$s grave.
But the Simple and pure Metals not being of the $ame weight as
the Compound, it will be nece$$ary, having found the proportion
of the Ma$s of the Gold to that of the Silver; to find by numbers
proportionally the exact quantity of each of the two Metals com-
pounding the Mixture.</P>
<P>A man may likewi$e u$e the quantity of the $imple Metals ac-
cording to nece$$ity and convenience, although of different
Weights, both as to each other, and to the Mixture, provided that
each of them be pure in its kind: but then we mu$t after-
wards by numbers find the proportion of the Ma$$es of the two
Simple ones of equal weight (which is $oon done, taking them of
equal weight as was $aid before) and then according to this pro-
portion to find, by means of the Weight, and of the Ma$s of the
Compound Metal, the di$tinct quantity of each of the two Sim-
ple ones that make the Compo$ition: of each of which Ca$es
examples might be given. But to conclude, if the pure Gold,
and pure Silver, and the Mixt Metal $hould be of equal Ma$s,
they would be unequal in Weight, and it would not need to
weigh them in the Water, for being of equal Bulk, the differen-
ces of their Weights in the Air and in the Water would be al$o
equal: for the difference of the weight of any Body in the Air
to its weight in the Water, is alwaies equal to the Weight of $o
much Water as equalleth the $ame Body in Ma$s, by <I>Archimedes</I>
his fifth Propo$ition, <I>De ijs qu&aelig; vehuntur in aqua.</I></P>
<P>And la$t of all, the Simple and pure Metals may have the $ame
proportion in Gravity, mutually or reciprocally, as their Bodies
have in Bulk: In which ca$e, as well the Ma$s, found by help of
the weight in Water, or by any other meanes, as their Weight in
the Air $hall $hew the proportion of their Specifical Gravities; as
their Weights in the Water do when their Weights in the Air
are equal; but yet alternately weighed: that is to $ay, the Spe-
cifical Gravity of the Gold $hall have $uch proportion to the
<foot>Specifical</foot>
<p n=>309</p>
Specifical Gravity of the Silver, as the Ma$s of the Silver hath to
the Ma$s of the Gold; that is, as the difference betwixt the
Weight in Water and Weight in Air of the Silver, hath to the
difference betwixt the Weight in Water and Weight in Air of
the Gold.</P>
<P>With this $ame Ballance one may with facility mea$ure the
Ma$s or Magnitude of any Body, in any manner what$oever Irre-
gular in manner following, namely:</P>
<P>We will have at hand a Solid Body of a $ub$tance more grave
<I>in Specie</I> than the Water; as for in$tance of Lead; or if it were
of Wood, or other matter more light <I>in Specie</I> than the Water,
it may be made heavier by fa$tning unto it Lead, or $ome other
thing that makes it $ink in the Water, and let us take $ome
known Mea$ure, and with it mea$ure the Irregular Solid; as for
in$tance, the Roman Palm, the Geometrical Foot, or any other
known mea$ure, or part of the $ame, as the half Foot, the quar-
ter of a Foot, or any $uch like part known; then let it be weighed
in the Air, and $uppo$e that it weigh 10 pounds; let the $ame
Mea$ure be weighed in the Air, and $uppo$e that it weigh 8
pounds: and $ub$tract 8 pounds, the Weight in the Water, from
10 pounds, the Weight in the Air, and there remaineth 2 pounds
for the Weight of a Body of Water equal in Magnitude to the
Mea$ure known. Now, if we would mea$ure a Statue of Mar-
ble, let it be weighed fir$t in the Air, and then in the Water, and
$ub$tract the Weight in the <I>W</I>ater from the <I>W</I>eight in the Air, and
the remainder $hall be the weight of $o much <I>W</I>ater as equalleth
the Statue in Ma$s; which being divided by the difference betwixt
the <I>W</I>eight in <I>W</I>ater and the <I>W</I>eight in Air of the Mea$ure known,
the Quotient will give how many times the Statue containeth the
$ame given Mea$ure. As for example; if the Statue in Air weigh
100 pounds, and in the <I>W</I>ater 80 pounds, 80 pounds being $ub-
$tracted from 100 there re$teth 20 pounds for the <I>W</I>eight of $o
much <I>W</I>ater in Ma$s as equalleth the Statue. But becau$e the
difference betwixt the <I>W</I>eight in <I>W</I>ater, and the <I>W</I>eight in Air
equal in Magnitude to the Mea$ure known, was $uppo$ed to be
2 pounds; divide 18 pounds by two pounds, and the Quotient
is 9, for the number of times that the propo$ed Statue containeth
the given Mea$ure. The $ame Method may be ob$erved, if it
were required, to mea$ure a Statue, or other Ma$s of any kind of
Metal: only it mu$t be adverti$ed, that all the holes mu$t be
$topt, that the <I>W</I>ater may not enter into the Body of the Statue:
but he that de$ireth only the Solid content of the Metal of the
$aid Statue mu$t open the holes, and with Tunnels fill the whole
cavity of the Statue with <I>W</I>ater. And if the Statue were of a
Sub$tance lighter <I>in Specie</I> than the <I>W</I>ater; as, for example, of
<foot><I>W</I>ax,</foot>
<p n=>310</p>
Wax, it will be requi$ite to add unto the Statue $ome Counter-
poi$e, that maketh it $ink in the <I>W</I>ater, and then to mea$ure the
Counterpoi$e, as above, and to $ub$tract its mea$ure from the
Compound Body, and there will remain the Mea$ure of the
Statue of <I>W</I>ax. And la$tly, to make u$e of the $aid Ballance,
in$tead of $eeking the numbers of the pounds of the Differences
of the <I>W</I>eights of the Mea$ure known, and of the Solid
to be mea$ured in <I>W</I>ater, and in Air, we may count the
<I>W</I>yers of the Arm of the Ballance, which
being very $mall will give the
Mea$ure exactly.</P>

<head>DISCOURSES
OF THE
MECHANICKS:
A MANVSCRIPT of
Mon$ieur Des-Cartes.</head>
<head>The Explication.</head>
<P><I>Of Engines, by help of which we may rai$e a very great
weight with $mall $trength.</I></P>
<P>The Invention of all the$e Engines de-
pends upon one $ole Principle, which is,
That the $ame Force that can lift up a
Weight, for example, of 100 pounds to
the height of one foot, can life up one of
200 pounds to the height of half a foot,
or one of 400 pounds to the height of a
fourth part of a foot, and $o of the re$t,
be there never $o much applyed to it: and
this Principle cannot be denied if we con$ider, that the Effect
ought to be proportioned to the Action that is nece$$ary for the
production of it; $o that, if it be nece$$ary to employ an Action by
which we may rai$e a Weight of 100 pounds to the height of two
foot, for to rai$e one $uch to the height of one foot only this $ame
ought to weigh 200 pounds: for its the $ame thing to rai$e 100
pounds to the height of one foot, and again yet another 100
pounds to the height of one foot, as to rai$e one of 200 pounds to
the height of one foot, and the $ame, al$o, as to rai$e 100 pounds
to the height of two feet.</P>
<P>Now, the Engines which $erve to make this Application of a
Force which acteth at a great Space upon a <I>W</I>eight which it cau-
<foot>$eth</foot>
<p n=>312</p>
$eth to be rai$ed by a le$$er, are the Pulley, the Inclined Plane, the
Wedg, the Cap$ten, or Wheel, the Screw, the Leaver, and $ome
others, for if we will not apply or compare them one to another,
we cannot well number more, and if we will apply them we need
not in$tance in $o many.</P>
<head>The PVLLEY, <I>Trochlea.</I></head>
<P>Let A B C be a Chord put about the Pulley D, to which let
the Weight E be fa$tned; and fir$t, $uppo$ing that two
men $u$tain or pull up equally each of them one of the
<fig>
ends of the $aid Chord:
it is manife$t, that if the
Weight weigheth 200
pounds, each of tho$e
men $hal employ but the
half thereof, that is to $ay,
the Force that is requi$ite
for $u$taining or rai$ing
of 100 pounds, for each
of them $hal bear but the
half of it.</P>
<P>Afterwards, let us $up-
po$e that A, one of the
ends of this Chord, being
made fa$t to $ome Nail,
the other C be again $u-
$tained by a Man; and it
is manife$t, that this Man in C, needs not (no more than before)
for the $u$taining the Weight E, more Force than is requi$ite for
the $u$taining of 100 pounds: becau$e the Nail at A doth the
$ame Office as the Man which we $uppo$ed there before. In fine,
let us $uppo$e that this Man in C do pull the Chord to make the
Weight E to ri$e, and it is manife$t, that if he there employeth
the Force which is requi$ite for the rai$ing of 100 pounds to the
height of two feet, he $hall rai$e this Weight E of 200 pounds to
the height of one foot: for the Chord A B C being doubled, as it
is, it mu$t be pull'd two feet by the end C, to make the Weight E
ri$e as much, as if two men did draw it, the one by the end A,
and the other by the end C, each of them the length of one foot
only.</P>
<P>There is alwaies one thing that hinders the exactne$s of the Cal-
culation, that is the pondero$ity of the Chord or Pulley, and the
difficulty that we meet with in making the Chord to $lip, and in
bearing it: but this is very $mall in compari$on of that which
<foot>rai$eth</foot>
<p n=>313</p>
rai$eth it, and cannot be e$timated $ave wthin a $mall matter.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is nece$$ary to ob$erve, that it is nothing but the
redoubling of the Chord, and not the Pulley, that cau$eth this
Force: for if we fa$ten yet another Pulley towards A, about
which we pa$s the Chord A B C H, there will be required no le$s
Force to draw H towards K, and $o to lift up the Weight E, than
there was before to draw C towards G. But if to the$e two Pul-
leys we add yet another towards D, to which we fa$ten the Weight,
and in which we make the Chord to run or $lip, ju$t as we did in
the fir$t, then we $hall need no more Force to lift up this Weight
of 200 pounds than to lift up 50 pounds without the Pulley: be-
cau$e that in drawing four feet of Chord we lift it up but one
foot. And $o in multiplying of the Pulleys one may rai$e the great-
e$t Weights with the lea$t Forces. It is requi$ite al$o to ob$erve,
that a little more Force is alwaies nece$$ary for the rai$ing of a
Weight than for the $u$taining of it: which is the rea$on why I
have $poken here di$tinctly of the one and of the other.</P>
<head><I>The Inclined</I> PLANE.</head>
<P>If not having more Force than $ufficeth to rai$e 100 pounds, one
would neverthele$s rai$e this Body F, that weigheth 200 pounds,
to the height of the Line B A, there needs no more but to draw
or rowl it along the Inclined Plane C A, which I $uppo$e to be
twice as long as the Line
<fig>
A B, for by this means,
for to make it arrive at
the point A, we mu$t
there employ the Force
that is nece$$ary for the
rai$ing 100 pounds twice
as high, and the more inclined this Plane $hall be made, $o much
the le$s Force $hall there need to rai$e the Weight F. But yet there
is to be rebated from this Calculation the difficulty that there is
in moving the Body F, along the Plane A C, if that Plane were
laid down upon the Line B C, all the parts of which I $uppo$e to
be equidi$tant from the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>It is true, that this impediment being $o much le$s as the Plane is
more united, more hard, more even, and more polite; it cannot
likewi$e be e$timated but by gue$s, and it is not very con$ide-
rable.</P>
<P>We need not neither much to regard that the Line B C being a
part of a Circle that hath the $ame Center with the Earth, the
Plane A C ought to be (though but very little) curved, and to
have the Figure of part of a Spiral, de$cribed between two Circles,
<foot>S$ which</foot>
<p n=>314</p>
which likewi$e have for their Center that of the Earth, for that it
is not any way $en$ible.</P>
<head><I>The</I> WEDGE, <I>Cuneus.</I></head>
<P>The Force of the Wedge A B C D is ea$ily under$tood after
that which hath been $poken above of the Inclined Plane,
for the Force wherewith we $trike downwards acts as if it
were to make it move according to the Line B D; and the Wood,
or other thing and Body that it cleaveth, openeth not, or the
Weight that it rai$eth doth not ri$e, $ave only according to the
<fig>
Line A C, in$omuch that the Force,
wherewith one driveth or $triketh this
Wedge, ought to have the $ame Pro-
portion to the Re$i$tance of this
Wood or Weight, that A C hath to
A B. Or el$e again, to be exact, it
would be convenient that B D were
a part of a Circle, and A D and
C D two portions of Spirals that had the $ame Center with the
Earth, and that the Wedge were of a Matter $o perfectly hard
and polite, and of $o $mall weight, as that any little Force would
$uffice to move it.</P>
<head><I>The</I> CRANE, <I>or the</I> CAPSTEN,
<I>Axis in Peritrochio.</I></head>
<P>We $ee al$o very ea$ily, that the Force wherewith the Wheel
A or Cogg B is turned, which make the Axis or Cylinder C
to move, about which a Chord is rolled, to which the
Weight D, which we would rai$e, is fa$tned, ought to have the
<fig>
$ame proportion to the $aid
Weight, as the Circumference of
the Cylinder hath to the Cir-
cumference of a Circle which
that Force de$cribeth, or that the
Diameter of the one hath unto
the Diameter of the other; for
that the Circumferences have the
$ame proportion as the Diame-
ters: in$omuch that the Cylinder C, having no more but one foot
in Diameter, if the Wheel AB be $ix feet in its Diameter, and the
Weight D do weigh 600 pounds, it $hall $uffice that the Force in
B $hall be capable to rai$e 100 pounds, and $o of others. One may
<foot>al$o</foot>
<p n=>315</p>
al$o in$tead of the Chord that rolleth about the Cylinder C, place
there a $mall Wheel with teeth or Coggs, that may turn another
greater, and by that means multiply the power of the Force as
much as one $hall plea$e, without having any thing to deduct of
the $ame, $ave only the difficulty of moving the Machine, as in the
others.</P>
<head><I>The</I> SCREW, <I>Cochlea.</I></head>
<P>When once the Force of the Cap$ten and of the In-
clined Plane is under$tood, that of the Screw is ea$ie
to be computed, for it is compo$ed only of a Plane
much inclined, which windeth about a Cylinder: and if this Plane
be in $uch manner Inclined, as that the Cylinder ought to make
<I>v. gr.</I> ten turns to advance forwards the length of a foot in the
Screw, and that the bigne$s of the Circumference of the Circle
<fig>
which the Force that turneth it
about doth de$cribe be of ten
feet; fora$much as ten times ten
are one hundred, one Man alone
$hall be able to pre$s as $trongly
with this In$trument, or Screw, as
one hundred without it, provided
alwaies, that we rebate the Force
that is required to the turning
of it.</P>
<P>Now I $peak here of Pre$$ing rather than of Rai$ing, or Remo-
ving, in regard that it is about this mo$t commonly that the Screw
is employed, but when we would make u$e of it for the rai$ing of
Weights, in$tead of making it to advance into a Female Screw, we
joyn or apply unto it a Wheel of many Coggs, in $uch $ort
made, that if <I>v. gr.</I> this <I>W</I>heel have thirty Coggs, whil$t the Screw
maketh one entire turn, it $hall not cau$e the <I>W</I>heel to make more
than the thirtieth part of a turn, and if the <I>W</I>eight be fa$tned to
a Chord that rowling about the Axis of this <I>W</I>heel $hall rai$e it but
one foot in the time that the <I>W</I>heel makes one entire revolution,
and that the greatne$s of the Circumference of the Circle that is
de$cribed by the Force that turneth the Screw about be al$o of ten
$eet, by rea$on that 10 times 30 make 300, one $ingle Man $hall be
able to rai$e a <I>W</I>eight of that bigne$s with this In$trument, which
is called the Perpetual Screw, as would require 300 men with-
out it.</P>
<P>Provided, as before, that we thence deduct the difficulty that
we meet with in turning of it, which is not properly cau$ed by the
Pondero$ity of the <I>W</I>eight, but by the Force or Matter of the In-
<foot>S$ <*> $trument</foot>
<p n=>316</p>
$trument: which difficulty is more $en$ible in it than in tho$e afore-
going, fora$much as it hath greater Force.</P>
<head>The LEAVER, <I>Vectis.</I></head>
<P>I Have deferred to $peak of the Leaver until the la$t, in regard
that it is of all Engines for rai$ing of Weights, the mo$t diffi-
cult to be explained.</P>
<P>Let us $uppo$e that C H is a Leaver, in $uch manner $upported
at the point O, (by means of an Iron Pin that pa$$eth thorow it
acro$s, or otherwi$e) that it may turn about on this point O, its
part C de$cribing the Semicircle A B C D E, and its part H the
<fig>
Semicircle F G H I K; and that
the Weight which we would
rai$e by help of it were in H,
and the Force in C, the Line
C O being $uppo$ed triple of
O H. Then let us con$ider that
in the Time whil$t the Force
that moveth this Leaver de$cri-
beth the whole Semicircle
A B C D E, and acteth accord-
ing to the Line A B C D E, al-
though that the Weight de$cri-
beth likewi$e the Semicircle
F G H I K, yet it is not rai$ed to
the length of this curved Line
F G H I K, but only to that of the Line F O K; in$omuch that the
Proportion that the Force which moveth this Weight ought to
have to its Pondero$ity ought not to be mea$ured by that which is
between the two Diameters of the$e Circles, or between their two
Circumferences, as it hath been $aid above of the Wheel, but ra-
ther by that which is betwixt the Circumference of the greater,
and the Diameter of the le$$er. Furthermore let us con$ider, that
there is a nece$$ity that this Force needeth not to be $o great, at
$uch time as it is near to A, or near to E, for the turning of the
Leaver, as then when it is near to B, or to D; nor $o great when
it is near to B or D, as then when it is near to C: of which the rea-
$on is, that the Weights do there mount le$s: as it is ea$ie to un-
der$tand, if having $uppo$ed that the Line C O H is parallel to the
Horizon, and that A O F cutteth it at Right Angles, we take the
point G equidi$tant from the points F and H, and the point B equi-
di$tant from A and C; and that having drawn G S perpendicular
to F O, we ob$erve that the Line F S (which $heweth how much
the Weight mounteth in the Time that the Force operates along
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>317</p>
the Line A B) is much le$$er than the Line S O, which $heweth
how much it mounteth in the Time that the Force opperates along
the Line B C.</P>
<P>And to mea$ure exactly what his Force ought to be in each Point
of the curved Line A B C D E, it is requi$ite to know that it ope-
rates there ju$t in the $ame manner as if it drew the Weight along
a Plane Circularly Inclined, and that the Inclination of each of the
Points of this circular Plane were to be mea$ured by that of the
right Line that toucheth the Circle in this Point. As for example,
when the Force is at the Point B, for to find the proportion that it
ought to have with the pondero$ity of the Weight which is at that
time at the Point G, it is nece$$ary to draw the Contingent Line
G M, and to account that the pondero$ity of the Weight is to the
Force which is required to draw it along this Plane, and con$e-
quently to rai$e it, according to the Circle F G H, as the Line G M
is to SM Again, for as much as B O is triple of O G, the Force
in B needs to be to the Weight in G but as the third part of the
Line SM is unto the whole Line G M. In the $elf $ame manner,
when the Force is at the Point D, to know how much the Weight
weigheth at I, it is nece$$ary to draw the Contingent Line betwixt
I and P, and the right Line I N perpendicular upon the Horizon,
and from the Point P taken at di$cretion in the Line I P, provided
that it be below the Point I, you mu$t draw P N parallel to the
$ame Horizon, to the end you may have the proportion that is be-
twixt the Line I P and the third part of the Line I N, for that which
betwixt the pondero$ity of the Weight, and the Force that ought to
be at the Point D for the moving of it: and $o of others. Where,
neverthele$s, you mu$t except the Point H, at which the Contin-
gent Line being perpendicular upon the Horizon, the Weight can
be no other than triple the Force which ought to be in C for the
moving of it: in the Points F and K, at which the Contingent
Line being parallel unto the Horizon it $elf, the lea$t Force that
one can a$$ign is $ufficient to move the Weight. Moreover, that you
may be perfectly exact, you mu$t ob$erve that the Lines S G and
P N ought to be parts of a Circle that have for their Center that
of the Earth; and GM and I P parts of Spirals drawn between two
$uch Circles; and, la$tly, that the right Lines S M and I N both
tending towards the Center of the Earth are not exactly Paral-
lels: and furthermore, that the Point H where I $uppo$e the
Contingent Line to be perpendicular unto the Horizon ought
to be $ome $mall matter nearer to the Point F than to K, at the
which F and K the Contingent Lines are Parallels unto the $aid
Horizon.</P>
<P>This done, we may ea$ily re$olve all the difficulties of the Ba-
lance, and $hew, That then when it is mo$t exact, and for in$tance,
<foot>$uppo$ing</foot>
<p n=>318</p>
$uppo$ing it's Centre at O by which it is $u$tained to be no more
but an indivi$ible Point, like as I have $uppo$ed here for the Leaver,
if the Armes be declined one way or the other, that which $hall be
the lowermo$t ought evermore to be adjudged the heavier; $o that
the Centre of Gravity is not $ixed and immoveable in each $everal
Body, as the Ancients have $uppo$ed, which no per$on, that I
know of, hath hitherto ob$erved.</P>
<P>But the$e la$t Con$iderations are of no moment in Practice, and
it would be good for tho$e who $et them$elves to invent new
Machines, that they knew nothing more of this bu$i-
ne$$e than this little which I have now writ thereof,
for then they would not be in danger of decei-
ving them$elves in their Computation,
as they frequently do in $uppo$ing
other Principles.</P>

<head>A
LETTER
OF
Mon$ieur Des-Cartes
TO THE
REVEREND FATHER
<I>MARIN MERSENNE.</I></head>
<P><I>Reverend Father,</I></P>
<P>I Did think to have deferred writing unto you
yet eight or fifteen dayes, to the end I might
not trouble you too often with my Letters,
but I have received yours of the fir$t of <I>Sept.</I>
which giveth me to under$tand that it is an
hard matter to admit the Principle which I
have $uppo$ed in my Examination of the
Geo$tatick Que$tion, and in regard that if it
be not true, all the re$t that I have inferred from it would be yet
le$$e true: I would not one onely day defer $ending you a more
particular Explication. It is requi$ite above all things to con$ider
that I did $peak of the Force that $erveth to rai$e a Weight to $ome
heighth, the which Force hath evermore two Dimen$ions, and not
of that which $erveth in each point to $u$tain it, which hath never
more than one Dimen$ion, in$omuch that the$e two Forces differ
as much the one from the other, as a Superficies differs from a Line:
for the $ame Force which a Nail ought to have for the $u$taining of
a Weight of 100 pound one moment of time, doth al$o $uffice for
to $u$tain it the $pace of a year, provided that it do not dimini$h,
but the $ame Quantity of this Force which $erveth to rai$e the
Weight to the heighth of one foot, $ufficeth not <I>(eadem numero)</I>
to rai$e it two feet; and it is not more manife$t that two and two
make four, than it's manife$t that we are to employ double as much
therein.</P>
<P>Now, fora$much as that this is nothing but the $ame thing that
I have $uppo$ed for a Principle, I cannot gue$$e on what the Scruple
$hould be grounded that men make of receiving it; but I $hall in
<foot>this</foot>
<p n=>320</p>
this place $peak of all $uch as I $u$pect, which for the mo$t part
ari$e onely from this, that men are before-hand over-knowing in
the Mechanicks; that is to $ay, that they are pre-occupied with
Principles that others prove touching the$e matters, which not being
ab$olutely true, they deceive the more, the more true they $eem to
be.</P>
<P>The fir$t thing wherewith a man may be pre-occupied in this
bu$ine$$e, is, that they many times confound the Con$ideration of
<fig>
Space, with that of Time, or of the Ve-
locity, $o that, for Example, in the
<I>L</I>eaver, or (which is the $ame) the Ba-
llance A B C D having $uppo$ed that
the Arm A B is double to B C, and the
Weight in C double to the Weight
in A, and al$o that they are in <I>Equilibrium,</I> in$tead of $aying, that
that which cau$eth this <I>Equilibrium</I> is, that if the Weight C did
$u$tain, or was rai$ed up by the Weight A, it did not pa$$e more
than half $o much Space as it, they $ay that it did move $lower by
the half: which is a fault $o much the more prejudicial, in that it is
very difficult to be known: for it is not the difference of
<fig>
the Velocity that is the cau$e why the$e Weights are to be
one double to the other, but the difference of the Space, as
appeareth by this, that to rai$e, for Example, the Weight F
with the hand unto G, it is not nece$$ary to employ a Force
that is preci$ely double to that which one $hould have
therein employed the fir$t bout, to rai$e it twice as quick-
ly, but it is requi$ite to employ therein either more or le$s
than the double, according to the different proportion that
this Velocity may have unto the Cau$es that re$i$t it.</P>
<P>In$tead of requiring a Force ju$t double for the rai$ing of it with
the $ame Velocity twice as high, unto H, I $ay that it is ju$t dou-
ble in counting (as two and two make four) that one and one make
two, for it is requi$ite to employ a certain quantity of this Force
to rai$e the Weight from F to G, and again al$o, as much more of
the $ame Force to rai$e it from G to H.</P>
<P>For if I had had a mind to have joyned the Con$ideration of the
Velocity with that of the Space, it had been nece$$ary to have
a$$igned three Dimen$ions to the Force, whereas I have a$$igned it
no more but two, on purpo$e to exclude it. And if I have te$tified
that there is $o little of worth in any part of this $mall Tract of the
Staticks, yet I de $ire that men $hould know, that there is more in
this alone than in all the re$t: for it's impo$$ible to $ay any thing
that is good and $olid touching Velocity, without having rightly
explained what we are to under$tand by Gravity, as al$o the whole
Sy$teme of the World. Now becau$e I would not under take it,
<foot>I have</foot>
<p n=>321</p>
I have thought good to omit this Con$ideration, and in this manner
to $ingle out the$e others that I could explain without it: for
though there be no Motion but hath $ome Velocity, neverthele$s
it is onely the Augmentations and Diminutions of this Velocity
that are con$iderable. And now that $peaking of the Motion of a
Body, we $uppo$e that it is made according to the Velocity which
is mo$t naturall to it, which is the $ame as if we did not con$ider it
at all.</P>
<P>The other rea$on that may have hindred men from rightly un-
der$tanding my Principle is, that they have thought that they could
demon$trate without it $ome of tho$e things which I demon$trate
not without it: As, for example, touching the Pulley A B C, they
have thought that it was enough to know that the Nail in A did
<fig>
$u$tain the half of the Weight B; to conclude
that the Hand in C had need but of half $o much
Force to $u$tain or rai$e the Weight, thus wound
about the Pulley, as it would need for to $u$tain
or rai$e it without it. But howbeit that this ex-
plaineth very well, how the application of the
Force at C is made unto a Weight double to that
which it could rai$e without a Pulley, and that I
my $elf did make u$e thereof, yet I deny that
this is $imply, becau$e that that the Nail A $u-
$taineth one part of the Weight B, that the Force
in C, which $u$taineth it, might be le$s than if it
had been $o $u$tained. For if that had been true, the Rope C E be-
ing wound about the Pulley D, the Force in E might by the $ame
rea$on be le$s than the Force in C: for that the Nail A doth not
$u$tain the Weight le$s than it did before, and that there is al$o
another Nail that $u$tains it, to wit, that to wich the Pulley D is
fa$tned. Thus therefore, that we may not be mi$taken in this, that
the Nail A $u$taineth the half of the Weight B, we ought to con-
clude no more but this, that by this application the one of the Di-
men$ions of the Force that ought to be in C
<fig>
to rai$e up this Weight is dimini$hed the one
half; and that the other, of con$equence, be-
cometh double, in $uch $ort that if the Line
F G repre$ent the Force that is required for
the $u$taining the Weight B in a point, with-
out the help of any Machine, and the
Quadrangle G H that which is required for
the rai$ing of it to the height of a foot, the
$upport of the Nail A dimini$heth the Di-
men$ion which is repre$ented by the Line F G the one half, and the
redoubling of the Rope A B C maketh the other Dimen$ion to
<foot>Tt double</foot>
<p n=>322</p>
double, which is repre$ented by the Line FH; and $o the Force
that ought to be in C for the rai$ing of the Weight B to the height
of one foot is repre$ented by the Quadrangle IK; and, as we know
in Geometry, that a Line being added to, or taken from a Superfi-
cies, neither augmenteth, nor dimini$heth it in the lea$t, $o the
Force where with the Nail A $u$tains the Weight B, having but one
$ole Dimen$ion, cannot cau$e that the Force in C, con$idered ac-
cording to its two Dimen$ions, ought to be le$s for the rai$ing in
like manner the Weight E, than for the rai$ing it without any
Pulley.</P>
<P>The third thing which may make men imagine $ome Ob$curity
in my Principle is, that they, it may be, have not had regard to all
the words by which I explain it; for I do not $ay $imply that the
Force that can rai$e a Weight of 50 pounds to the height of four
feet can rai$e one of 200 pounds to the height of one foot; but I
$ay that it may do it, if $o be that it be applyed to it: now it is
impo$$ible to apply the $ame thereto, but by the means of $ome Ma-
chine, or other Invention that $hall cau$e this Weight to a$cend
but one, in the time whil$t the Force pa$$eth the whole length
of four feet, and $o that it do transform the Quandrangle, by
which the Force is repre$ented that is required to rai$e this
Weight of 400 pounds to the height of one foot into another
that is equall and like to that which repre$ents the Force that is
required for to rai$e a Weight of 50 pounds to the height of four
feet.</P>
<P>In fine, it may be that men may have thought the wor$e of my
Principle, becau$e they have imagined that I have alledged the Ex-
amples of the Pulley, of the Inclined Plane, and of the Leaver, to
the end that I might better per$warde the truth thereof, as if it had
been dubious, or el$e that I had $o ill di$cour$ed as to offer to a$$ume
from thence a Principle, which ought of it felf to be $o clear, as not
to need any proof by things that are $o difficult to comprehend as
that; it may be, they have never been well demon$trated by any
man: but neither have I made u$e of them, $ave only with a de$ign
to $hew that this Principle extends it $elf to all matters of which
one treateth in the Staticks: or, rather, I have made u$e of this oc-
ca$ion for to in$ert them into my Treati$e, for that I conceived
that it would have been too dry and barren if I had therein $po-
ken of nothing el$e but of this Que$tion, that is of no u$e, as of
that of the Geo$taticks, which I purpo$ed to examine.</P>
<P>Now one may perceive, by what hath already been $aid, how
the Forces of the Leaver and Pulley are demon$trated by my
Principle $o well, that there only remains the Inclined Plane, of
which you $hall clearly $ee the Demon$tration by this Figure; in
which G F repre$ents the fir$t Dimen$ion of the Force that the
<foot>Rectangle</foot>
<p n=>323</p>
Rectangle F H de$cribeth whil$t it draweth the Weight D along
the Plane B A, by the means of a Chord parallel to this Plane, and
pa$$ing about the Pulley E, in $uch $ort, that H G, that is the height
of this Rectangle, is equal to B A, along which the Weight D is to
move, whil$t it mounteth to the height of the Line C A. And N O
repre$ents the fir$t Dimen$ion of $uch another Force, that is de-
$cribed by the Rectan-
gle N P, in the time that
<fig>
it is rai$ing the Weight
L to M. And I $uppo$e
that L M is equal to B A,
or double to C A; and
that N O is to F G, as
O P is to G H. This
done, I con$ider that at
$uch time as the Weight
D is moved from B to-
wards A, one may ima-
gine its Motion to be
compo$ed of two others, of which the one carrieth it from B R to-
wards C A, (to which operation there is no Force required, as all
tho$e $uppo$e who treat of the Mechanicks) and the other rai$eth
it from B C towards R A, for which alone the Force is required:
in$omuch that it needs neither more nor le$s Force to move it
along the Inclined Plane B A, than along the Perpendicular C A.
For I $uppo$e that the unevenne$$es, <I>&amp;c.</I> of the Plane do not
at all hinder it, like as it is alwaies $uppo$ed in treating of this
matter.</P>
<P>So then the whole Force F H is employed only about the rai$ing
of D to the height of C A: and fora$much as it is exactly equal to
the Force N P, that is required for the rai$ing of L to the Height
of L M, double to C A, I conclude by my Principle that the
Weight D is double to the Weight L. For in regard that it is
nece$$ary to employ as much Force for the one as for the other,
there is as much to be rai$ed in the one as in the other; and no
more knowledge is required than to count unto two for the
knowing that it is alike facile to rai$e 200 pounds from C to A,
as to rai$e 100 pounds from L to M: $ince that L M is double
to C A.</P>
<P>You tell me, moreover, that I ought more particularly to ex-
plain the nature of the Spiral Line that repre$enteth the Plane
equally enclined, which hath many qualities that render it $uffi-
ciently knowable.</P>
<foot>Tt 2 For</foot>
<p n=>324</p>
<P>For if A be the Center of the Earth,
<fig>
and A N B C D the Spiral Line, having
drawn the Right Lines A B, A D, and the
like, there is the $ame proportion betwixt
the Curved Line A N B and the Right Line
AB, as is betwixt the Curved Line A N B C,
and the Right Line A C; or betwixt
A N B C D and A D: and $o of the
re$t.</P>
<P>And if one draw the Tangents D E, C F,
and B G, the Angles A D E, A C F, A B G, &amp;c.
$hall be equal. As for the re$t I will, &amp;c.----</P>

LETTER
OF
Mon$ieur de Robberval
TO
Mon$ieur de Fermates,
Coun$ellour of <I>THOULOUSE,</I>
Containing certain Propo$itions in the
MECHANICKS.</head>
<P>MONSIEUR,</P>
<P>I have, according to my promi$e, $ent you the
Demon$tration of the Fundamental Propo$i-
tion of our Mechanicks, in which I follow the
common method of explaining, in the fir$t
place, the Definitions and Principles of which
we make u$e.</P>
<P>We in general call that Quality a Force or
Power, by means of which any thing whatever
doth tend or a$pire into another place than that in which it is, be it
downwards, upwards, or $ide waies, whether this Quality naturally
belongeth to the Body, or be communicated to it from without.
From which definition it followeth, that all Weights are a $pecies
of Force, in regard that it is a Quality, by means whereof Bodies
do tend downwards. We often al$o a$$ign the name of Force to
that very thing to which the Force belongeth, as a ponderous Bo-
dy is called a Weight, but with this pre-caution, that this is in re-
ference to the true Force, the which augmenting or dimini$hing
$hall be called a greater or le$$er Force, albeit that the thing to
which it belongeth do remain alwaies the $ame.</P>
<P>If a Force be $u$pended or fa$tned to a Flexible Line that is
without Gravity, and that is made fa$t by one end unto $ome <I>Ful-
ciment</I> or $tay, in $uch $ort as that it $u$tain the Force, drawing
<foot>without</foot>
<p n=>326</p>
without impediment by this Line, the Force and the Line $hall
take $ome certain po$ition in which they $hall re$t, and the Line
$hall of nece$$ity be $treight, let that Line be termed <I>the Pendant,</I>
or <I>Line of Direction of the Force.</I> And let the Point by which it is
fa$tned to the Fulciment be called <I>the Point of Su$pen$ion</I>: which
may $ometimes be the Arm of a Leaver or Ballance; and then let
the Line drawn from the Center of the Fulciment of the Leaver
or Ballance to the Point of Su$pen$ion be named <I>the Di$tance</I> or
<I>the Arm of the Force</I>: which we $uppo$e to be a Line fixed, and
con$idered without Gravity. Moreover, let the Angle comprehen-
ded betwixt the Arm of the Force and the Line of Direction be
termed <I>the Angle of the Direction of the Force.</I></P>
<head>AXIOM I.</head>
<P>After the$e Definitions we lay down for a Principle, that in the
Leaver, and in the Ballance, Equal Forces drawing by Arms
that are equal, and at equall Angles of Direction, do draw equal-
ly. And if in this Po$ition they draw one again$t the other they
$hall make an <I>Equilibrium</I>: but if they draw together, or towards
the $ame part, the Effect $hall be double.</P>
<P>If the Forces being equal, and the Augles of Direction al$o
equal, the Arms be unequal, the Force that $hall be $u$pended at
the greater Arm $hall work the greater Effect.</P>
<P>As in this Figure, the Center of the Ballance or Leaver being A,
<fig>
if the Arms A B and A C are equal,
as al$o the Angles A B D, and A C E,
the equal Forces D and E $hall
draw equally, and make an <I>Equili-
brium.</I> So likewi$e the Arm A F be-
ing equal to A B, the Angle A F G
to the Angle A B D, and the Force
G to D, the$e two Forces ^{*} G and D
<marg>* In the M. S.
Copy it is <I>C and
D.</I></marg>
draw equally; and in regard that
they draw both one way, the Effect
$hall be double.</P>
<P>In the $ame manner the Forces G and E $hall make an <I>Equilibri-
um</I>; as al$o I and L $hall counterpoi$e, if (being equal) the Arms
A K and A H, and the Angles A H T, and A K L be equal.</P>
<P>The $ame $hall befall in the Forces P and R, if all things be
di$po$ed as before. And in this ca$e we make no other di$tinction
betwixt Weights and other Forces $ave only this, that Weights all
tend towards the Center of Grave Bodies, and Forces may be un-
der$tood to tend all towards all parts of the Univer$e, with $o
much greater or le$$er <I>Impetus</I> than Weights. So that Weights and
<foot>their</foot>
<p n=>327</p>
their parts do draw by Lines of Direction, which all concur in one
and the $ame Point; and Forces and their parts may be under$tood
to draw in $uch $ort that all the Lines of Direction are parallel to
each other.</P>
<head>AXIOM II.</head>
<P>In the $econd place, we $uppo$e that a Force and its Line of Di-
rection abiding alwaies in the $ame po$ition, as al$o the Center
of the Ballance or Leaver, be the Arm what it will that is drawn
from the Center of the Ballance to the Line of Direction, the
Force drawing alwaies in the $ame fa$hion, will alwaies produce
the $ame Effect.</P>
<P>As, in this $econd Figure, the Center of the Ballance being A,
the Force B, and the Line of Direction
<fig>
B <I>F</I> prolonged, as occa$ion $hall re-
quire, in which the Arms A G, A C, and
A <I>F</I> do determine, in this po$ition let
the Line B <I>F</I> be fa$tned to the Arm
A <I>F,</I> or A C, or to another Arm drawn
from the Center A to the Line of Di-
rection ^{*} B <I>F</I>: we $uppo$e that this
<marg>* In the Original
it is writ, but by
the mi$take of
the Tran$criber,
<I>a la ligue de</I> di-
rection A F.</marg>
<I>F</I>orce B $hall alwaies work the $ame
Effect upon the Ballance. And if
drawing by the Arm A C it make an
<I>Equilibrium</I> with the <I>F</I>orce <I>D</I> drawing by the <I>A</I>rm <I>A</I> E, when
ever it $hall draw by the <I>A</I>rms <I>A F</I> or <I>A</I> G, it $hall likewi$e make
an <I>Equilibrium</I> with the <I>F</I>orce D drawing by the <I>A</I>rm <I>A E.</I> This
Principle although it be not expre$ly found in <I>A</I>uthors, yet it is
tacitly $uppo$ed by all tho$e that have writ on this <I>A</I>rgument, and
Experience con$tantly confirmeth it.</P>
<head>AXIOM III.</head>
<P>I<I>f</I> the Arms of a Ballance or Leaver are directly placed the one to
the other, and that being equal they $u$tain equal <I>F</I>orces, of which
the Angles of Direction are Right An-
<fig>
gles, the$e <I>F</I>orces do alwaies weigh
equally upon the Center of the Bal-
lance, whether that they be near to the
$ame Center, or far di$tant, or both
conjoyned in the Center it $elf; as in
this <I>F</I>igure the Ballance being E D,
the Center A, the equal Arms A D
and <I>A</I> E, let us $u$tain equal <I>F</I>orces H and I, of which the <I>A</I>ngles
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>328</p>
of Direction <I>A</I> D H and <I>A</I> E I are Right <I>A</I>ngles, we $uppo$e that
the$e two <I>F</I>orces I and H weigh alike upon the Center <I>A</I> as if they
were nearer to the Center, at the equal Di$tances <I>A</I> B and A C,
and we al$o $uppo$e the $ame if the$e very <I>F</I>orces were $u$pended
both together in <I>A,</I> the <I>A</I>ngles of Directions being $till Right
<I>A</I>ngles.</P>
<head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
<P>The$e Principles agreed upon, we will ea$ily demon$trate,
in Imitation of <I>Archimedes,</I> that upon a $traight Balance
the <I>F</I>orces, of which and of all their parts the Lines of Dire-
ction are parallel to one another, and perpendicular to the Balance,
$hall couuterpoi$e and make an <I>Equilibrium,</I> when the $aid <I>F</I>orces
$hall be to one another in Reciprocal proportion of their Arms,
which we think to be $o manife$t to you, that we thence $hall de-
rive the Demon$tration of this Univer$al Propo$ition to which we
ha$ten.</P>
<head>PROPOS. II.</head>
<P>In every Balance or Leaver, if the proportion of the <I>F</I>orces is
reciprocal to that of the Perpendicular Lines drawn from the
Center or Point of the <I>F</I>ulciment unto the Lines of Direction
of the <I>F</I>orces, drawing the one again$t the other, they $hall make
an <I>Equilibrium,</I> and drawing on one and the $ame $ide, they $hall
have a like Effect, that is to $ay, that they $hall have as much <I>F</I>orce
the one as the other, to move the Balance.</P>
<P>In this <I>F</I>igure let the Center of the Balance be <I>A,</I> the <I>A</I>rm <I>A</I> B,
bigger than <I>A</I> C, and fir$t let the <I>L</I>ines of Direction B D, and E C
be perpendicular to the <I>A</I>rms <I>A</I> B and <I>A</I> C, by which Lines the
<I>F</I>orces D and E (which may be made of Weights if one will) do
draw; and that there is the $ame rate
<fig>
of the <I>F</I>orce D to the Force E as there
is betwixt the <I>A</I>rm <I>A</I> C to the Arm
<I>A</I> B: the Forces drawing one again$t
the other, I $ay, that they will make an
<I>Equilibrium</I> upon the Balance <I>C</I> A B.
For let the <I>A</I>rm C <I>A</I> be prolonged
unto F, $o as that <I>A</I>F may be equal to
<I>A</I> B: and let C <I>A</I> F be con$idered as a
$treight Balance, of which let the Center be <I>A</I>: and let there be
$uppo$ed two Forces G and H, of which and of all their parts the
Lines of Direction are parallel to the Line C E, and that the
Force G be equal to the Force D, and H to E, the one, to wit G,
<foot>drawing</foot>
<p n=>329</p>
drawing upon the Arm A <I>F,</I> and the other, to wit H, upon the Arm
A C: now, by the fir$t Propo$ition, G and H $hall make an <I>Equili-
brium</I> upon the Balance C A F: But, by the fir$t Principle, the Force
D upon the Arm A B worketh the $ame effect as the Force G on
the Arm A F: Therefore the Force D upon the Arm A B maketh
an <I>Equilibrium</I> with the Force H upon A C: And the Force H
drawing in the $ame manner upon the Arm <I>A</I> C as the Force E, by
the $ame fir$t <I>A</I>xiom, the Force D upon the Arm <I>A</I> B $hall make an
<I>Equilibrium</I> with the Force E upon the Arm <I>A</I> C.</P>
<P>Now, in the following Figure, let the Center of the Balance be
<I>A,</I> the Arms A B and A C, the Lines of Direction B D and C E
which are not Perpendicular to the Arms, and the Forces D and E
drawing likewi$e by the Lines of Direction, upon which Perpen-
diculars are erected unto the Center A, that is A F upon B D, and
A G upon E C, and that as A F is to A G, $o is the Force E to the
Force D: which Forces draw one
<fig>
again$t the other: I $ay, that they will
make an <I>Equilibrium</I> upon the Balance
C A B: For let the Lines A F and A G
be under$tood to be the two Arms of
a Balance G A F, upon which the For-
ces D and E do draw by the Lines of
Direction F D and G E: The$e Forces
$hall make an <I>Equilibrium,</I> by the fir$t
part of this $econd Propo$ition; but, by the $econd Axiom, the Force
D upon the Arm A F hath the $ame Effect as upon the Arm A B:
Therefore the Force D upon the Arm A B maketh an <I>Equilibrium</I>
with the Force E upon the Arm A C.</P>
<P>There are many Ca$es, according to the Series of Perpendicu-
lars, but it will be ea$ie for you to $ee that they have all but one
and the $ame Demon$tration.</P>
<P>It is al$o ea$ie to demon$trate, that if the Forces draw both on
one $ide they $hall make the $ame Effect one as another, and that
the Effect of two together $hall be double to that of one alone.</P>
<head>OF THE
GEOSTATICKS.</head>
<P>The Principle which you demand for the <I>Geo$taticks</I> is,
That if two equal Weights are conjoyned by a right
Line fixed and void of Gravity, and that being $o di-
$po$ed they may de$cend freely, they will never re$t till
that the middle of the Line, that is the Center of Gravitation of
the Ancients, unites it $elf to the common Center of Grave Bodies.</P>
<foot>Uu This</foot>
<p n=>330</p>
<P>This Principle $eems at the fir$t very plau$ible, but when
the Que$tion concerneth a Principle, you know what Conditions
are required to it, that it may be received, the principal of which are
wanting in the Principle now in controver$ie<I>: $cil.</I> that we do not
know what is the radical Cau$e why Grave Bodies de$cend; and
whence the Original of this Gravity ari$eth: as al$o that we are to-
tally ignorant of that which would arrive at the Center whither
Grave Bodies do tend, nor to other places without the Surface of the
Earth, of which, in regard we inhabit upon it, we have $ome Expe-
riments upon which we ground our Principles.</P>
<P>For it may be, that Gravity is a Quality that re$ides in the Body
it $elf that falleth; it may be that it is in another that attracteth
that which de$cends, as in the Earth: It may be, and it is very likely
that it is a Natural Attraction, or a Natural De$ire of two Bodies to
unite together, as in the Iron and Load$tone, which are $uch, that
if the Load$tone be $taid, the Iron, if nothing hinder it, will go find
it out; and if the Iron be $taid the Load$tone will go towards it;
and if they be both at liberty, they will reciprocally approach one
another, yet after $uch a fa$hion, that the $tronge$t of the two
will move the lea$t way.</P>
<P>If the fir$t be true, according to the common opinion, we $ee not
how your Principle can $ub$i$t, for Common Sen$e tells us, that in
whatever place a Weight is, it alwaies weigheth alike, having ever-
more the $ame Quality that maketh it to weigh, and that then a Bo-
dy will repo$e at the Common Center of things Grave when the
parts of the Body which $hall be on each part of the $aid Center
$hall be of equal Pondero$ity to counterpoi$e one another, without
having any regard whether they be little or much removed from the
Center. Since therefore that of the$e three po$$ible Cau$es of Gra-
vitation, we know not which is the right, nay, that we are not cer-
tain that it is any of them, it being po$$ibly that there is a fourth
from which one may draw Conclu$ions very different, it $eemeth to
me impo$$ible for us to lay down other Principles in this bufine$s
than tho$e of which we are a$$ured by a continual Experience, and
a $ound Judgment. As for our parts, we call tho$e Bodies equally
or unequally Grave which have an equal or unequal Force of mo-
ving towards the Common Center: and a Body is $aid to have the
$ame Weight when it alwaies hath this $ame Force: but if this
Force augmenteth or dimini$heth, then, although it be the $ame Bo-
dy, we con$ider it no longer as the $ame Weight: Now $ince that
this hapneth to Bodies that recede or approach to the Common
Center, this is it which we de$ire to know, but finding nothing that
giveth me content upon this Subject, I will leave the Que$tion un-
determined and unde$cribed.</P>

of which I under$tand uot the Cau$e, and therefore, if it

<head>SVPPOSITION I.</head>
<P><I>It is $uppo$ed that the Liquid is of $uch a nature, that
its parts being equi-jacent and contiguous, the le$s
pre$$ed are repul$ed by the more pre$$ed. And
that each of its parts is pre$$ed or repul$ed by the
Liquor that lyeth over it, perpendicularly, if the
Liquid be de$cending into any place, or pre$$ed any
whither by another.</I></P>
<P>NIC. Every Science, Art, or Doctrine (as you know, <I>Honoured Companion,</I>)
hath its fir$t undemon$trable Principles, by which (they being
granted or $uppo$ed) the $aid Science is proved, maintained, or de-
mon$trated. And of the$e Principles, $ome are called <I>Petitions,</I>
and others <I>Demands,</I> or <I>Suppo$itions.</I> I $ay, therefore, that the Science or Doctrine
of tho$e Material Solids that Swim or Sink in Liquids, hath only two undemon-
$trable <I>Suppo$itions,</I> one of which is that above alledged, the which in compliance
with your de$ire I have $et down in our Vulgar Tongue.</P>
<P>RIC. Before you proceed any farther tell me, how we are to under$tand the
parts of a Liquid to be <I>Equijacent.</I></P>
<P>NIC. When they are equidi$tant from the Center of the World, or of the
Earth (which is the $ame, although ^{*} $ome hold that the Centers of the Earth
and Worldare different.)</P>
<P>RIC. I under$tand you not unle$s you give me $ome Example thereof in
Figure.</P>
<marg>* The Coperni-
cans.</marg>
<P>NIC. To exemplifie this particular, Let us $uppo$e a quantity of Liquor (as
for in$tance of Water) to be upon the Earth; then let us with the Imagination
cut the whole Earth together with that Water into two equal parts, in $uch a
manner as that the $aid Section may pa$s ^{*} by the Center of the Earth: And let
us $uppo$e that one part of the Superficies of that Section, as well of the Water
as of the Earth, be the Superficies A B, and that the Center of the Earth be the
point K. This being done, let us in our Imagination de$cribe a Circle upon the
<marg>* Or through.</marg>
$aid Center K, of $uch a bigne$s as that the Circumference may pa$s by the Super-
ficies of the Section of the Water: Now let this Circumference be E F G: and
let many Lines be drawn from the point K to the $aid Circumference, cutting the
$ame, as KE, KHO, KFQ KLP, KM. Now I $ay, that all the$e parts of
the $aid Water, terminated in that Circumference, are Equijacent, as being all
<foot>equi-</foot>
<p n=>335</p>
equidi$tant from the point K, the Center of the World, which parts are G M,
M L, L F, F H, H E.</P>
<P>RIC. I under$tand you very well, as to this particular: But tell me a little; he
$aith that each of the parts of the Liquid is pre$$ed or repul$ed by the Liquid that
is above it, according to the Perpendicular: I know not what that Liquid is that
lieth upon a part of another Perpendicularly.</P>
<P>NIC. Imagining a Line that cometh from the Center of the Earth penetrating
thorow $ome Water, each part of the Water that is in that Line he $uppo$eth to
be pre$$ed or repul$ed by the Water that lieth above it in that $ame Line, and that
that repul$e is made according to the $ame Line, (that is, directly towards the
Center of the World) which Line is called a Perpendicular; becau$e every
Right-Line that departeth from any point, and goeth directly towards the Worlds
Center is called a Perpendicular. And that you may the better under$tand me, let
<fig>
us imagine
the Line KHO,
and in that
let us imagine
$everal parts,
as $uppo$e RS,
S T, T V, V H,
H O. I $ay,
that he $up-
po$eth that
the part V H
is pre$$ed by
that placed a-
bove it, H O,
according to
the Line OK;
the which
O K, as hath been $aid above, is called the Perpendicular pa$$ing thorow tho$e two
parts. In like manner, I $ay that the part T V is expul$ed by the part V H, ac-
cording to the $aid Line O K: and $o the part S T to be pre$$ed by T V, according
to the $aid Perpendicular O K, and R S by S T. And this you are to under$tand
in all the other Lines that were protracted from the $aid Point K, penetrating the
$aid Water, As for Example, in <I>K</I> G, <I>K</I> M, <I>K</I> L, <I>K</I> F, <I>K</I> E, and infinite others of the
like kind.</P>
<P>RIC. Indeed, <I>Dear Companion,</I> this your Explanation hath given megreat $a-
tisfaction; for, in my Judgment, it $eemeth that all the difficulty of this Suppo$ition
con$i$ts in the$e two particulars which you have declared to me.</P>
<P>NIC. It doth $o; for having under$tood that the parts E H, H F, F L, L M, and
MG, determining in the Circumference of the $aid Circle are equijacent, it is an
ea$ie matter to under$tand the fore$aid <I>Suppo$ition</I> in Order, which $aith, <I>That it is
$uppo$ed that the Liquid is of $uch a nature, that the part thereof le$s pre$$ed or thrust is re-
pul$ed by the more thru$t or pre$$ed.</I> As for example, if the part E H were by chance
more thru$t, crowded, or pre$$ed from above downwards by the Liquid, or $ome
other matter that was over it, than the part H F, contiguous to it, it is $uppo$ed
that the $aid part H F, le$s pre$$ed, would be repul$ed by the $aid part E H. And
thus we ought to under$tand of the other parts equijacent, in ca$e that they be
contiguous, and not $evered. That each of the parts thereof is pre$$ed and repul.
$ed by the <I>L</I>iquid that lieth over it Perpendicularly, is manife$t by that which was
$aid above, to wit, that it $hould be repul$ed, in ca$e the <I>L</I>iquid be de$cending into
any place, and thru$t, or driven any whither by another.</P>
<P>RIC. I under$tand this Suppo$ition very well, but yet me thinks that before
the Suppo$ition, the Author ought to have defined tho$e two particulars, which
you fir$t declared to me, that is, how we are to under$tand the parts of the <I>L</I>iquid
equijacent, and likewi$e the Perpendicular.</P>
<foot>NIC. You</foot>
<p n=>336</p>
<P>NIC. You $ay truth.</P>
<P>RIC. I have another que$tion to aske you, which is this, Why the Author
u$eth the word <I>L</I>iquid, or Humid, in$tead of Water.</P>
<P>NIC. It may be for two of the$e two Cau$es; the one is, that Water being the
principal of all <I>L</I>iquids, therefore $aying <I>Humidum</I> he is to be under$tood to mean
the chief Liquid, that is Water: The other, becau$e that all the Propo$itions of
this Book of his, do not only hold true in Water, but al$o in every other <I>L</I>iquid,
as in Wine, Oyl, and the like: and therefore the Author might have u$ed the word
<I>Humidum,</I> as being a word more general than <I>Aqua.</I></P>
<P>RIC. This I under$tand, therefore let us come to the fir$t <I>Propo$ition,</I> which, as
you know, in the Original $peaks in this manner.</P>
<head>PROP. I. THEOR. I.</head>
<P><I>If any Superficies $hall be cut by a Plane thorough any
Point, and the Section be alwaies the Circumference
of a Circle, who$e Center is the $aid Point: that Su-
perficies $hall be Spherical.</I></P>
<P>Let any Superficies be cut at plea$ure by a Plane thorow the
Point K; and let the Section alwaies de$cribe the Circumfe-
rence of a Circle that hath for its Center the Point K: I $ay,
that that $ame Superficies is Sph&aelig;rical. For were it po$$ible that the
$aid Superficies were not Sph&aelig;rical, then all the Lines drawn
through the $aid Point K unto that Superficies would not be equal,
Let therefore A and B be two
Points in the $aid Superficies, $o that
<fig>
drawing the two Lines K A and
K B, let them, if po$$ible, be une-
qual: Then by the$e two Lines let
a Plane be drawn cutting the $aid
Superficies, and let the Section in
the Superficies make the Line
D A B G: Now this Line D A B G
is, by our pre-$uppo$al, a Circle, and
the Center thereof is the Point K, for $uch the $aid Superficies was
$uppo$ed to be. Therefore the two Lines K A and K B are equal:
But they were al$o $uppo$ed to be unequal; which is impo$$ible:
It followeth therefore, of nece$$ity, that the $aid Superficies be
Sph&aelig;rical, that is, the Superficies of a Sph&aelig;re.</P>
<P>RIC. I under$tand you very well; now let us proceed to the $econd <I>Propo$ition,</I>
which, you know, runs thus.</P>
<foot>PROP.</foot>
<p n=>337</p>
<head>PROP. II. THEOR. II.</head>
<P><I>The Superficies of every Liquid that is con$i$tant and
$etled $hall be of a Sph&aelig;rical Figure, which Figure
$hall have the $ame Center with the Earth.</I></P>
<P>Let us $uppo$e a Liquid that is of $uch a con$i$tance as that it
is not moved, and that its Superficies be cut by a Plane along
by the Center of the Earth, and let the Center of the Earth
be the Point K: and let the Section of the Superficies be the Line
A B G D. I $ay that the Line A B G D is the Circumference of a
<fig>
Circle, and that the Center
thereof is the Point K And
if it be po$$ible that it may
not be the Circumference
of a Circle, the Right-
<marg>* O: through.</marg>
Lines drawn ^{*} by the Point
K to the $aid Line A B G D
$hall not be equal. There-
fore let a Right-Line be
taken greater than $ome of tho$e produced from the Point K unto
the $aid Line A B G D, and le$$er than $ome other; and upon the
Point K let a Circle be de$cribed at the length of that Line,
Now the Circumference of this Circle $hall fall part without the
$aid Line A B G D, and part within: it having been pre$uppo$ed
that its Semidiameter is greater than $ome of tho$e Lines that may
be drawn from the $aid Point K unto the $aid Line A B G D, and
le$$er than $ome other. Let the Circumference of the de$cribed
Circle be R B G H, and from B to K draw the Right-Line B K: and
drawn al$o the two Lines K R, and K E L which make a Right-
Angle in the Point K: and upon the Center K de$cribe the Circum-
ference X O P in the Plane and in the Liquid. The parts, there-
fore, of the Liquid that are ^{*} according to the Circumference
<marg>* <I>i.e.</I> Parallel.</marg>
X O P, for the rea$ons alledged upon the fir$t <I>Suppo$ition,</I> are equi-
jacent, or equipo$ited, and contiguous to each other; and both
the$e parts are pre$t or thru$t, according to the $econd part of the
<I>Suppo$ition,</I> by the Liquor which is above them. And becau$e the
two Angles E K B and B K R are $uppo$ed equal [<I>by the</I> 26. <I>of</I> 3.
<I>of Euclid,</I>] the two Circumferences or Arches B E and B R $hall
be equal (fora$much as R B G H was a Circle de$cribed for $atis-
faction of the Oponent, and K its Center:) And in like manner
the whole Triangle B E K $hall be equal to the whole Triangle
B R K. And becau$e al$o the Triangle O P K for the $ame rea$on
<foot>Xx $hall</foot>
<p n=>338</p>
$hall be equal to the Triangle O X K; Therefore (by common
Notion) $ub$tracting tho$e two $mall Triangles O P K and O X K
from the two others B E K and B R K, the two Remainders $hall
be equal: one of which Remainders $hall be the Quadrangle
B E O P, and the other B R X O. And becau$e the whole Quadran-
gle B E O P is full of Liquor, and of the Quadrangle B R X O,
the part B A X O only is full, and the re$idue B R A is wholly void
of Water: It followeth, therefore, that the Quadrangle B E O P
is more ponderous than the Quadrangle B R X O. And if the $aid
Quadrangle B E O P be more Grave than the Quadrangle
B R X O, much more $hall the Quadrangle B L O P exceed in Gra-
vity the $aid Quadrangle B R X O: whence it followeth, that the
part O P is more pre$$ed than the part O X. But, by the fir$t part
of the Suppo$ition, the part le$s pre$$ed $hould be repul$ed by the
part more pre$$ed: Therefore the part O X mu$t be repul$ed by
the part O P: But it was pre$uppo$ed that the Liquid did not
move: Wherefore it would follow that the le$s pre$$ed would not
be repul$ed by the more pre$$ed: And therefore it followeth of
nece$$ity that the Line A <I>B</I> G D is the Circumference of a Circle,
and that the Center of it is the point K. And in like manner $hall
it be demon$trated, if the Surface of the Liquid be cut by a Plane
thorow the Center of the Earth, that the Section $hall be the Cir-
cumference of a Circle, and that the Center of the $ame $hall be
that very Point which is Center of the Earth. It is therefore mani-
fe$t that the Superficies of a Liquid that is con$i$tant and $etled
$hall have the Figure of a Sph&aelig;re, the Center of which $hall be
the $ame with that of the Earth, by the fir$t <I>Propo$ition</I>; for it is
$uch that being ever cut thorow the $ame Point, the Section or Di-
vi$ion de$cribes the Circumference of a Circle which hath for Cen-
ter the $elf-$ame Point that is Center of the Earth: Which was to
be demon$trated.</P>

no umbrage of Doubting, let us proceed to his third <I>Propo$ition.</I></P>

<P>For $uppo$ing, on the contrary, that it were po$$ible for one of
tho$e Solids being placed in the Liquid to lie in part without the
Liquid, that is above its Surface, (alwaies provided that the $aid
Liquid be $etled and undi$turbed,) let us imagine any Plane pro-
duced thorow the Center of the Earth, thorow the Liquid, and
thorow that Solid Body: and let us imagine that the Section of the
Liquid is the Superficies A B G D, and the Section of the Solid
Body that is within it the Super$icies E Z H T, and let us $uppo$e
the Center of the Earth to be the Point K: and let the part of the
$aid Solid $ubmerged in the Liquid be B G H T, and let that above
be B E Z G: and let the Solid Body be $uppo$ed to be comprized in
a Pyramid that hath its Parallelogram Ba$e in the upper Surface of
the Liquid, and its Summity or Vertex in the Center of the Earth:
which Pyramid let us al$o $uppo$e to be cut or divided by the $ame
Plane in which is the Circumference A B G D, and let the Sections
<fig>
of the Planes of the $aid
Pyramid be K L and
K M: and in the Liquid
about the Center K let
there be de$cribed a Su-
perficies of another
Sph&aelig;re below E Z H T,
which let be X O P;
and let this be cut by
the Superficies of the Plane: And let there be another Pyramid ta-
ken or $uppo$ed equal and like to that which compri$eth the $aid
Solid Body, and contiguous and conjunct with the $ame; and let
the Sections of its Superficies be K M and K N: and let us $uppo$e
another Solid to be taken or imagined, of Liquor, contained in that
$ame Pyramid, which let be R S C Y, equal and like to the partial
Solid B H G T, which is immerged in the $aid Liquid: But the
part of the Liquid which in the fir$t Pyramid is under the Super-
ficies X O, and that, which in the other Pyramid is under the Su-
perficies O P, are equijacent or equipo$ited and contiguous, but
are not pre$$ed equally; for that which is under the Superficies
X O is pre$$ed by the Solid T H E Z, and by the Liquor that is
contained between the two Spherical Superficies X O and L M
and the Planes of the Pyramid, but that which proceeds accord-
ing to F O is pre$$ed by the Solid R S C Y, and by the Liquid
<foot>Xx 2 contained</foot>
<p n=>340</p>
contained between the Sph&aelig;rical Superficies that proceed accord-
ing to P O and M N and the Planes of the Pyramid; and the Gra-
vity of the Liquid, which is according to M N O P, $hall be le$$er
than that which is according to L M X O; becau$e that Solid of
Liquor which proceeds according to R S C Y is le$s than the Solid
E Z H T (having been $uppo$ed to be equal in quantity to only
the part H B G T of that:) And the $aid Solid E Z H T hath been
$uppo$ed to be equally grave with the Liquid: Therefore the Gra-
vity of the <I>L</I>iquid compri$ed betwixt the two Sph&aelig;rical Superfi-
cies L M and <I>X</I> O, and betwixt the $ides L <I>X</I> and M O of the

the Sides M O and N P
of the Pyramid, toge-
ther with the Solid of Liquor R S C Y by the quantity of the Gra-
vity of the part E B Z G, $uppo$ed to remain above the Surface of
the Liquid: And therefore it is manife$t that the part which pro-
ceedeth according to the Circumference O P is pre$$ed, driven, and
repul$ed, according to the <I>Suppo$ition,</I> by that which proceeds ac-
cording to the Circumference X O, by which means the Liquid
would not be $etled and $till: But we did pre$uppo$e that it was
$etled, namely $o, as to be without motion: It followeth, therefore,
that the $aid Solid cannot in any part of it exceed or lie above the
Superficies of the Liquid: And al$o that being dimerged in the Li-

Liquid equijacent, or di$po$ed equally, are equally pre$$ed, becau$e
the Solid is equally grave with the Liquid, by what we pre$uppo$ed.</P>
<P>RIC. I do under$tand your Argumentation, but I under$tand not that Phra$e
<I>Solid Magnitudes.</I></P>
<P>NIC. I will declare this Term unto you. <I>Magnitude</I> is a general Word that
re$pecteth all the Species of Continual Quantity; and the Species of Continual

is al$o called a Solid, as having in it $elf <I>L</I>ength, Breadth, and Thickne$s, or Depth:

meant of <I>L</I>ines, or Superficies, but only of Solid <I>Magnitudes,</I> that is, Bodies, he
did $pecifie it by that manner of expre$$ion, as was $aid. The truth is, that he

<P>NIC. In this fourth <I>Propo$ition</I> it is concluded, that every Body or Solid that is
lighter (as to Specifical Gravity) than the <I>L</I>iquid, being put into the

<P>For $uppo$ing, on the contrary, that it were po$$ible for a Solid
more light than the Liquid, being demitted in the Liquid to $ub-
merge totally in the $ame, that is, $o as that no part thereof re-
maineth above, or without the $aid Liquid, (evermore $uppo$ing
that the Liquid be $o con$tituted as that it be not moved,) let us
imagine any Plane produced thorow the Center of the Earth, tho-
row the Liquid, and thorow that Solid Body: and that the Surface
of the Liquid is cut by this Plane according to the Circumference
A <I>B</I> G, and the Solid <I>B</I>ody according to the Figure R; and let the
Center of the Earth be K. And let there be imagined a Pyramid
<fig>
that compri$eth the Figure

cedent, that hath its Ver-
tex in the Point K, and let
the Superficies of that
Pyramid be cut by the
Superficies of the Plane
A <I>B</I> G, according to A K

gine another Pyramid equal and like to this, and let its Superficies
be cut by the Superficies A <I>B</I> G according to K <I>B</I> and K <I>G</I>; and let
the Superficies of another Sph&aelig;re be de$cribed in the Liquid, upon

ramid, and that which is under the Spherical Superficies that pro-
ceeds according to the Circumference O P, in the $econd Pyramid,
are equijacent, and contiguous, but are not pre$$ed equally; for
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>342</p>
that of the fir$t Pyramid is pre$$ed by the Solid R, and by the Liquid
which that containeth, that is, that which is in the place of the Py-

is in the place of the $aid Pyramid according to P O B G: and the
Gravity of the Solid R is le$s than the Gravity of the Liquid
H, for that the$e two Magnitudes were $uppo$ed to be equal in

and the Ma$$es of the two Pyramids of Liquor that containeth the$e
<marg>* For that the Py-

two Solids R and H are equal ^{*} by what was pre$uppo$ed: There-

pre$$ed, whereby the $aid Liquid will not be $etled: But it was be-
fore $uppo$ed that it was $etled: Therefore that Solid R $hall not
totally $ubmerge, but $ome part thereof will remain without the

<head>PROP. V. THEOR. V.</head>
<P><I>Solid Magnitudes that are lighter than the Liquid,
being demitted in the ($etled) Liquid, will $o far
$ubmerge, till that a Ma$s of Liquor, equal to the
Part $ubmerged, doth in Gravity equalize the
whole Magnitude.</I></P>
<P>NIC. It having, in the precedent, been demon$trared that Solids lighter than
the Liquid, being demitted in the <I>L</I>iquid, alwaies a part of them remains
without the <I>L</I>iquid, that is above its Surface; In this fifth <I>Propo$ition</I> it is
a$$erted, that $o much of $uch a Solid $hall $ubmerge, as that a Ma$s of the
<I>L</I>iquid equal to the part $ubmerged, $hall have equal Gravity with the whole
Solid.</P>
<P>And to demon$trate this, let us a$$ume all the $ame Schemes
as before, in <I>Propo$ition</I> 3. and likewi$e let the Liquid be $et-
led, and let the Solid E Z H T be lighter than the Liquid.
Now if the $aid Liquid be $etled, the parts of it that are equija-
cent are equally pre$$ed: Therefore the Liquid that is beneath
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>343</p>
the Superficies that proceed according to the Circumferences X O
and P O are equally pre$$ed; whereby the Gravity pre$$ed is equal.
<fig>
But the Gravity of the
Liquid which is in the

being deducted.</marg>
fir$t Pyramid ^{*} without
the Solid B H T G, is
equal to the Gravity of
the Liquid which is in
the other Pyramid with-
out the Liquid R S C Y:
It is manife$t, therefore,
that the Gravity of the Solid E Z H T, is equal to the Gravity of
the Liquid R S C Y: Therefore it is manife$t that a Ma$s of Liquor
equal in Ma$s to the part of the Solid $ubmerged is equal in Gra-
vity to the whole Solid.</P>
<P>RIC. This was a pretty Demon$tration, and becau$e I very well under$tand
it, let us lo$e no time, but proceed to the $ixth <I>Propo$ition,</I> $peaking thus.</P>
<head>PROP. VI. THEOR. VI.</head>
<P><I>Solid Magnitudes lighter than the Liquid being thru$t
into the Liquid, are repul$ed upwards with a Force
as great as is the exce$s of the Gravity of a Ma$s
of Liquor equal to the Magnitude above the Gra-
vity of the $aid Magnitude.</I></P>
<P>NIC. This $ixth <I>Propo$ition</I> $aith, that the Solids lighter than the Liquid
demitted, thru$t, or trodden by Force underneath the Liquids Sur-
face, are returned or driven upwards with $o much Force, by
how much a quantity of the Liquid equal to the. Solid $hall
exceed the $aid Solid in Gravity.</P>
<P>And to delucidate this <I>Propo$ition,</I> let the Solid A be lighter
than the <I>L</I>iquid, and let us $uppo$e that the Gravity of the $aid
Solid A is B: and let the Gravity of a <I>L</I>iquid, equal in Ma$s to A,
be B G. I $ay, that the Solid A depre$$ed or demitted with Force
into the $aid <I>L</I>iquid, $hall be returned and repul$ed upwards with
a Force equal to the Gravity G. And to demon$trate this <I>Propo-
$ition,</I> take the Solid D, equal in Gravity to the $aid G. Now
the Solid compounded of the two Solids A and D will be lighter
than the <I>L</I>iquid: for the Gravity of the Solid compounded of
them both is BG, and the Gravity of as much Liquor as equal-
leth in greatne$s the Solid A, is greater than the $aid Gravity BG,
<foot>for</foot>
<p n=>344</p>
for that B G is the Gravity of the Liquid equal in Ma$s unto it:
Therefore the Solid compounded of tho$e two Solids A and D
being dimerged, it $hall, by the precedent, $o much of it $ubmerge,
as that a quantity of the Liquid equal to the $aid $ubmerged part
$hall have equal Gravity with the $aid compounded Solid. And
<fig>
for an example of that <I>Propo$ition</I> let the Su-
perficies of any Liquid be that which pro-
ceedeth according to the Circumference
A B G D: Becau$e now a Ma$s or quantity
of Liquor as big as the Ma$s A hath equal
Gravity with the whole compounded Solid
A D: It is manife$t that the $ubmerged part
thereof $hall be the Ma$s A: and the remain-
der, namely, the part D, $hall be wholly a-
top, that is, above the Surface of the Liquid.
It is therefore evident, that the part A hath $o much virtue or
Force to return upwards, that is, to ri$e from below above the Li-
quid, as that which is upon it, to wit, the part D, hath to pre$s it
downwards, for that neither part is repul$ed by the other: But D
pre$$eth downwards with a Gravity equal to G, it having been $up-
po$ed that the Gravity of that part D was equal to G: Therefore
that is manife$t which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<P>RIC. This was a fine Demon$tration, and from this I perceive that you colle-
cted your <I>Indu$trious Invention</I>; and e$pecially that part of it which you in$ert in
the fir$t Book for the recovering of a Ship $unk: and, indeed, I have many Que-
$tions to ask you about that, but I will not now interrupt the Di$cour$e in hand, but
de$ire that we may go on to the $eventh <I>Propo$ition,</I> the purport whereof is this.</P>
<head>PROP. VII. THEOR. VII.</head>
<P><I>Solid Magnitudes beavier than the Liquid, being de-
mitted into the [$etled] Liquid, are boren down-
wards as far as they can de$cend: and $hall be lighter
in the Liquid by the Gravity of a Liquid Ma$s of
the $ame bigne$s with the Solid Magnitude.</I></P>
<P>NIC. This $eventh <I>Propo$ition</I> hath two parts to be demon$trated.</P>
<P>The fir$t is, That all Solids heavier than the Liquid, being demit-
ted into the <I>L</I>iquid, are boren by their Gravities downwards as far
as they can de$cend, that is untill they arrive at the Bottom. Which
fir$t part is manife$t, becau$e the Parts of the <I>L</I>iquid, which $till lie
under that Solid, are more pre$$ed than the others equijacent,
becau$e that that Solid is $uppo$ed more grave than the Liquid.
<foot>But</foot>
<p n=>345</p>
But now that that Solid is lighter in the Liquid than out of it, as
is affirmed in the $econd part, $hall be demon$trated in this man-
ner. Take a Solid, as $uppo$e A, that is more grave than the Li-
quid, and $uppo$e the Gravity of that $ame Solid A to be BG.
And of a Ma$s of <I>L</I>iquor of the $ame bigne$s with the Solid A, $up-
po$e the Gravity to be B: It is to be demon$trated that the Solid
A, immerged in the Liquid, $hall have a Gravity equal to G. And
to demon$trate this, let us imagine another Solid, as $uppo$e D,
more light than the Liquid, but of $uch a quality as that its Gravi-
ty is equal to B: and let this D be of $uch a Magnitude, that a
Ma$s of <I>L</I>iquor equal to it hath its Gravity equal to the Gravity
B G. Now the$e two Solids D and A being compounded toge-
ther, all that Solid compounded of the$e two $hall be equally
Grave with the Water: becau$e the Gravity of the$e two Solids
together $hall be equal to the$e two Gravities, that is, to B G, and
<fig>
to B; and the Gravity of a Liquid that hath its
Ma$s equal to the$e two Solids A and D, $hall be
equal to the$e two Gravities B G and B. <I>L</I>et
the$e two Solids, therefore, be put in the <I>L</I>iquid,
<marg>* Or, according to
<I>Commandine,</I> $hall
be equall in Gravi-
ty to the Liquid,
neither moving up-
wards or down-
wards.</marg>
and they $hall ^{*} remain in the Surface of that <I>L</I>i-
quid, (that is, they $hall not be drawn or driven
upwards, nor yet downwards:) For if the Solid
A be more grave than the Liquid, it $hall be
drawn or born by its Gravity downwards to-
wards the Bottom, with as much Force as by the Solid D it is thru$t
upwards: And becau$e the Solid D is lighter than the <I>L</I>iquid, it
$hall rai$e it upward with a Force as great as the Gravity G: Be-
cau$e it hath been demon$trated, in the $ixth <I>Propo$ition,</I> That So-
lid Magnitudes that are lighter than the Water, being demitted in
the $ame, are repul$ed or driven upwards with a Force $o much the
greater by how much a <I>L</I>iquid of equal Ma$s with the Solid is more
Grave than the $aid Solid: But the <I>L</I>iquid which is equal in Ma$s
with the Solid D, is more grave than the $aid Solid D, by the Gra-
vity G: Therefore it is manife$t, that the Solid A is pre$$ed or
born downwards towards the Centre of the World, with a Force
as great as the Gravity G: Which was to be demon$trated.</P>
<P>RIC. This hath been an ingenuous Demon$tration; and in regard I do $uffici-
ently under$tand it, that we may lo$e no time, we will proceed to the $econd <I>Suppo-

from the Centre of the World, or of the Earth, unto the Centre of Gravity of
that Body, or Solid.</P>

<foot>For</foot>
<p n=>347</p>
<P>For the declaration of this <I>Propo$ition,</I> let a Solid Magnitude
that hath the Figure of a portion of a Sph&aelig;re, as hath been $aid,
be imagined to be de-

mitted into the Liquid; and
al$o, let a Plain be $uppo$ed
to be produced thorow the

thorow the Center of the

of the Surface of the Liquid
be the Circumference A B

Circumference E F H, &amp; let
E H be a right line, and F T
the Axis of the Portion. If now

in all other places,

drawn thorow the

pendicular; we are then to demon$trate, that the Figure will not
continue as it was con$tituted by the Adver$ary, but that it will re-
turn, as hath been $aid, unto its former po$ition, that is, that the
Axis F T $hall be according to the Perpendicular. It is manife$t, by
the <I>Corollary</I> of the 1. of 3. <I>Euclide,</I> that the Center of the Sph&aelig;re
is in the Line F T, fora$much as that is the Axis of that Figure.
And in regard that the Por-
<fig>
tion of a Sph&aelig;re, may be
greater or le$$er than an He-
mi$ph&aelig;re, and may al$o be
an Hemi$ph&aelig;re, let the Cen-
tre of the Sph&aelig;re, in the He-
mi$ph&aelig;re, be the Point T,
and in the le$$er Portion the
Point P, and in the greater,
the Point K, and let the Cen-
tre of the Earth be the Point
L. And $peaking, fir$t, of
that greater Portion which
hath its Ba$e out of, or a-
bove, the Liquid, thorew the Points K and L, draw the Line KL
cutting the Circumference E F H in the Point N, Now, becau$e
<marg>C</marg>
every Portion of a Sph&aelig;re, hath its Axis in the Line, that from the
Centre of the Sph&aelig;re is drawn perpendicular unto its Ba$e, and hath
its Centre of Gravity in the Axis; therefore that Portion of the Fi-
gure which is within the Liquid, which is compounded of two Por-
<foot>Y y 2 tions</foot>
<p n=>348</p>
tions of a Sph&aelig;re, $hall have its Axis in the Perpendicular, that is
drawn through the point K; and its Centre of Gravity, for the $ame
rea$on, $hall be in the Line N K: let us $uppo$e it to be the Point R:
<marg>D</marg>
But the Centre of Gravity of the whole Portion is in the Line F T,
betwixt the Point R and
<fig>
the Point F; let us $uppo$e
it to be the Point <I>X</I>: The re-
mainder, therefore, of that
<marg>E</marg>
Figure elivated above the
Surface of the Liquid, hath
its Centre of Gravity in
the Line R X produced or
continued right out in the
Part towards X, taken $o,
that the part prolonged may
have the $ame proportion to
X R, that the Gravity of
that Portion that is demer-
ged in the Liquid hath to
the Gravity of that Figure which is above the Liquid; let us $uppo$e
<marg>* <I>i. e,</I> The Center
of Gravity.</marg>
that ^{*} that Centre of the $aid Figure be the Point S: and thorow that
<marg>F</marg>
$ame Centre S draw the Perpendicular L S. Now the Gravity of the Fi-
gure that is above the Liquid $hall pre$$e from above downwards ac-
cording to the Perpendicular S L; &amp; the Gravity of the Portion that
is $ubmerged in the Liquid, $hall pre$$e from below upwards, accor-
ding to the Perpendicular R L. Therefore that Figure will not conti-
nue according to our Adver$aries Propo$all, but tho$e parts of the
$aid Figure which are towards E, $hall be born or drawn downwards,
&amp; tho$e which are towards H $hall be born or driven upwards, and
this $hall be $o long untill that the Axis F T comes to be according
to the Perpendicular.</P>
<P>And this $ame Demon$tration is in the $ame manner verified in
the other <I>P</I>ortions. As, fir$t, in the H&aelig;mi$phere that lieth with its
whole Ba$e above or without the <I>L</I>iquid, the Centre of the Sph&aelig;re
hath been $uppo$ed to be the <I>P</I>oint T; and therefore, imagining T
to be in the place, in which, in the other above mentioned, the
<I>P</I>oint R was, arguing in all things el$e as you did in that, you $hall
find that the Figure which is above the <I>L</I>iquid $hall pre$s from
above downwards according to the <I>P</I>erpendicular S <I>L</I>; and the
<I>P</I>ortion that is $ubmerged in the <I>L</I>iquid $hall pre$s from below up-
wards according to the <I>P</I>erpendicular R <I>L.</I> And therefore it $hall
follow, as in the other, namely, that the parts of the whole Figure
which are towards E, $hall be born or pre$$ed downwards, and tho$e
<marg>* Or according
to the Perpendi-
cular.</marg>
that are towards H, $hall be born or driven upwards: and this $hall
be $o long untill that the Axis F T come to $tand ^{*} <I>P</I>erpendicular-

Right Angles; as in our Commentaries

of the Sph&aelig;re B N C is N M; and the
Axis of the Portion B G C is M G:
from whence it followeth that the Axis of
the Portion demerged in the Liquid is
in the Line K L, namely N G. And $ince the Center of Gravity of any Portion of a Sph&aelig;re is
in the Axis, as we have demonstrated in our Book</I> De Centro Gravitatis Solidorum, <I>the
Centre of Gravity of the Magnitude compounded of both the Portions B N C &amp; B G C, that is,
of the Portion demerged in the Water, is in the Line N G that doth conjoyn the Centers of Gra-

may be $hewn by Propo$ition 6. of this. And becau$e they are moved along $everall other Line <*>
neither cau$eth the others being le$s moved; the which it continually doth when the Porti<*>

more famous Author, to di$cern the truth of the Doctrine affirmed, namely, That Solids of the
Figure of Portions of Sph&aelig;res demitted into the Liquid with their Ba$es upwards $hall $tand
erectly, that is, with their Axis according to the Perpendicular drawn from the Centre of the
Earth unto its Circumference: And that if the $aid Portions be demitted with their Ba$es
oblique and touching the Liquid in one Point, they $hall not rest in that Obliquity, but $hall
return to Rectitude: And that la$tly, if the$e Portions be demitted with their Ba$es downwards,
they $hall continue erect with their Axis according to the Perpendicular afore$aid: $o that no
more remains to be done, but that we$et before you the 2 Books of this our Admirable Author.</I></P>

<P>For let any Solid Magnitude, as for in-

A F is to A E, $o $hall A K be to K H. It is in the $ame manner

<P>The $ame things a$$umed again, and M Q being drawn from the

<P><I>For make H R equall to G F; and $eeing that</I>

<I>the Triangles A F C and O P N are alike, and

mon$trate P O and F A to be equall to each other:
Wherefore P O $hall be double to F B: But H O
is double to G B: Therefore the Remainder P H
is al$o double to the Remainder F G; that is, to
R H: And therefore is followeth that P R, R H
and F G are equall to one another; as al$o that
R G and P F are equall: For P G is common to
both R P and G F. Since therefore, that H B is
to B G, as G B is to B F, by Conver$ion of Pro-
portion, B H $hall be to H G, as B G is to G F:
But Q H is to H B, as H O to B G. For by 35
of our fir$t Book of</I> Conicks, <I>in regard that Q
M toucheth the Section in the Point M, H B and
B Q $hall be equall, and Q H double to H B:
Therefore,</I> ex &aelig;quali, <I>Q H $hall be to H G, as
H O to G F; that is, to H R: and,</I> Permu-

<P>The$e things therefore being explained, we come now to that

<P><I>For $ince that H Q is to Q O, as H G to C N</I>;
<fig>
<I>that is, to A O, equall to the $aid C N: The Re-

H Q to Q O: and, for the $ame cau$e, the Lines
A C and G L prolonged, by the things that wee
have above demonstrated, $hall inter$ect or meet
in the Line Q M. Again, G Q is to Q A,
as H Q to Q O: that is, as H G to F P; as</I>
<marg>(a) <I>By</I> 2. Lemma.</marg>
(a) <I>was bnt now demonstrated, But unto</I> (b) <I>G</I>
<marg>(b) <I>By</I> 4. Lemma.</marg>
<I>Q two Lines taken together, Q B that is H B, and
B G are equall: and to Q A H F is equall; for
if from the equall Magnitudes H B and B Q there
be taken the equall Magnitudes F B and B A, the
Re mainder $hall be equall; Therefore taking H
G from the two Lines H B and B G, there $hall re-
main a Magnitude double to B G; that is, O H:
and P F taken from F H, the Remainder is H P:
Wherefore</I> (c) <I>O H is to H P, as G Q to Q A:</I>
<marg>(b) <I>By 19. of the

<I>But as G Q is to Q A, $o is H Q to Q O;</I>
<foot><I>that</I></foot>

<I>that is, H G to N C: and as</I> (d) <I>O H is to H P, $o is G B to C K; For O H is double

that H G hath to G B.</I></P>
<P>Then take $ome other Point at plea$ure in the Section, which

moreover, let B R be equall to O <G>w,</G> and R K to T <G>w;</G> and let <G>w</G> H

<marg>D</marg>
that the Axis of the Portion doth make an Angle with the Surface

greater than the Angle B: Therefore the Square P I hath greater

<G>*y</G> B, $o is half of the Line K R unto the Line <G>*y</G> B: Wherefore
<I>(a)</I> K R hath greater proportion to I Y, than the half of K R hath

to <G>*y</G> B: And, con$equently, I Y isle$$e than the double of <G>*y</G> B,

<marg>H</marg>
greater than <G>*y</G> R: but <G>*y</G> R is equall to F: Therefore I <G>w</G> is greater
<marg>K</marg>
than F. And becau$e that the Portion is $uppo$ed to be in Gra-
vity unto the Liquid, as the Square F Q is to the Square B D; and
$ince that as the Portion is to the Liquid in Gravity, $o is the part
thereof $ubmerged unto the whole Portion; and in regard that as
the part thereof $ubmerged is to the whole, $o is the Square P M to
the Square O N; It followeth, that the Square P M is to the Square
N O, as the Square F Q is to the Square B D: And therefore F
<marg>L</marg>

which is within the Liquid, the Point Z; and of the remaining

part the Centre $hall be in the Line Z T prolonged unto G. In
<foot>Bbb 2 the</foot>
<p n=>372</p>
the $ame manner we might demon-

$trate the <I>L</I>ine T H to be perpendi-
cular unto the Surface of the Liquid:
and that the Portion demerged with-
in the <I>L</I>iquid moveth or a$cend-
eth out of the <I>L</I>iquid according to
the Perpendicular that $hall be
drawn thorow Z unto the Surface
of the Liquid; and that the part
that is above the Liquid de$cendeth
into the Liquid according to that
drawn thorow G: therefore the Portion will not continue $o inclined
as was $uppo$ed: But neither $hall it return to Rectitude or Per-
pendicularity; For that of the Perpendiculars drawn thorow Z and
G, that pa$$ing thorow Z doth fall on tho$e parts which are to-
wards L; and that that pa$$eth thorow G on tho$e towards A:
Wherefore it followeth that the Centre Z do move upwards,
and G downwards: Therefore the parts of the whole Solid which
are towards A $hall move downwards, and tho$e towards L up-
wards. Again let the Propo$ition run in other termes; and let
the Axis of the Portion make an Angle with the Surface of the
<marg>O</marg>
Liquid le$$e than that which is at B. Therefore the Square P I
hath le$$er Proportion unto the Square
<fig>
I Y, than the Square E <G>*y</G> hath to the
Square <G>*y</G> B: Wherefore K R hath
le$$er proportion to I Y, than the half
of K R hath to <G>*y</G> B: And, for the
$ame rea$on, I Y is greater than dou-
ble of <G>*y</G> B: but it is double of O I:
Therefore O I $hall be greater than
<G>*y</G> B: But the Totall O <G>w</G> is equall
to R B, and the Remainder <G>w</G> I le$$e
than <G>y</G> R: Wherefore P H $hall al$o
be le$$e than F. And, in regard that
M P is equall to F Q, it is manife$t that P M is greater than $e$qui-
alter of P H; and that P H is le$$e than double of <I>H</I> M. <I>L</I>et P Z
be double to Z M. The Centre of Gravity of the whole Solid $hall
again be T; that of the part which is within the Liquid Z; and
drawing a Line from Z to T, the Centre of Gravity of that which
is above the Liquid $hall be found in that Line portracted, that is
in G: Therefore, Perpendiculars being drawn thorow Z and G
<marg>P</marg>
unto the Surface of the Liquid that are parallel to T H, it followeth
that the $aid Portion $hall not $tay, but $hall turn about till
that its Axis do make an Angle with the Waters Surface greater than
that which it now maketh. And becau$e that when before we
<foot>did</foot>
<p n=>373</p>
did $uppo$e that it made an Angle greater than the Angle B, the
Poriton did not re$t then neither; It is manife$t that it $hall $tay
<marg>Q</marg>
or re$t when it $hall make an Angle eqnall to B. For $o $hall I O
be equall to <G>*y</G> <I>B</I>; and <G>w</G> I equall to

of that part of it which is within the

Square B D is greater than the

to the Square B D, than the Exce$s
by which the Square B D is greater
than the Square F Q hath to the

by which the Axis of the Portion is
greater than Se$quialter of the

<marg>A</marg>
the Square B D doth more exceed
the Square F Q, than doth the
Square B C: And, con$equently, the Line F Q is le$s than B C;
<foot>and</foot>

and F le$s than B R. Let R <G>*y</G> be equall to F; and draw <G>*y</G> E
perpendicular to B D; which let be in power the half of that
which the Lines K R and <G>*y</G> B containeth; and draw a Line from
B to E: I $ay that the Portion demitted into the Liquid, $o as that
its Ba$e be wholly within the Liquid, $hall $o $tand, as that its Axis
do make an Angle with the Liquids Surface, equall to the Angle B.
For let the <I>P</I>ortion be demitted into the Liquid, as hath been $aid;
and let the Axis not make an Angle with the Liquids Surface, equall
to B, but fir$t a greater: and the $ame being cut thorow the Axis
by a Plane erect unto the Surface of the Liquid, let the Section of
the Portion be A P O L, the Section of a Rightangled Cone; the
Section of the Surface of the Liquid <G>*g</G> I; and the Axis of the

the Points <G>w</G> and T, as before: and draw Y P, parallelto <G>*g</G> I, and
touching the Section in P, and MP parallel to N O, and P S perpen-
dicular to the Axis. And becau$e now that the Axis of the Portion
maketh an <I>A</I>ngle with the Liquids Surface greater than the Angle
B, the Angle S Y P $hall al$o be greater than the Angle B: And,
therefore, the Square P S hath greater proportion to the Square
<marg>B</marg>
S Y, than the Square <G>*y</G> E hath to the Square <G>*y</G> B: And, for that
cau$e, K R hath greater proportion to S Y, than the half of K R

which the Square B D, is greater than the Square F Q, hath unto
the Square B D; and that as the Portion is in proportion to the
Liquid in Gravity, $o is the part thereof $ubmerged unto the whole
Portion; It followeth that the part $ubmerged, hath the $ame
proportion to the whole <I>P</I>ortion, that the Exce$s by which the

Portion is to that part which is above
the Liquid, $o is the Square N O unto
the Square P M: Therefore, P M
$hall be equall to F Q: But it
hath been demon$trated, that P H is
greater than F. And, therefore,

greater than double of H M. Let
therefore, P Z be double to Z M:

Gravity of the whole Portion $hall

demon$trated, as before, that T H
is perpendicular to the Surface of
the Liquid, and that the Lines
drawn thorow Z and G parallel to the $aid T H, are al$o perpen-
diculars unto the $ame: Therefore, the Part which is above the
Liquid $hall move downwards, along that which pa$seth thorow Z;
and that which is within it, $hall move upwards, along that which
pa$seth thorow G: And, therefore, the Portion $hall not remain
$o inclined, nor $hall $o turn about, as that its Axis be perpendicular

downwards, and tho$e towards <I>A</I> upwards; as may appear by

(g) <I>as the Line B K is to the Line K H, $o is the Line F L to L M: And,</I> Permutando,
<I>as B K is to F L, $o is K H to L M: But B K was to F L, as K C to C L: Therefore,
K H is to L M, as K C to C L: And, therefore, by the preceding Lemma, it is manife$t that
the Line H C al$o $hall pa$s thorow the Point M: As K C, therefore, is to C L, that is,
as A C to C E, $o is H C to C M; that is, to the $ame part of it $elf, that lyeth betwixt C and
the Section E F C. And, in like manner might we demon$trate, that the $ame happeneth
in other Lines, that are produced from the Point C, and the Sections E B C. And, that
B C hath the $ame proportion to C F, plainly appeareth; for B C is to C F, as D C to C G;
that is, as their Duplicates A C to C E.</I></P>
<P>From whence it is manife$t, that all Lines $o drawn, $hall be cut by the
$aid Section in the $ame proportion. For, by Divi$ion and Conver$ion,
C M is to M H, and C F to F B, as C E to E A.</P>
<head>LEMMA. III.</head>
<P>And, hence it may al$o be proved, that the Lines which are
drawn in like Portions, $o, as that with the Ba$es, they con-
tain equall Angles, $hall al$o cut off like Portions; that is,
as in the foregoing Figure, the Portions H B C and M F C,
which the Lines C H and C M do cut off, are al$o alike to
each other.</P>
<P><I>For let C H and C M be divided in the midst in the Points P and Q; and thorow tho$e
Points draw the Lines R P S and T Q V parallel to the Diameters. Of the Portion
H S C the Diameter $hall be P S, and of the Portion M V C the Diameter $hall be</I>

<I>Q V. And, $uppo$e that as the Square C R is to the Square C P, $o is the Line B N unto
another Line; which let be S X: And, as the Square C T is to the Square C Q $o let F O
be to V Y. Now it is manife$t, by the things which we have demon$trated, in our Commentaries,
upon the fourth Propo$ition of</I> Archimedes, De Conoidibus &amp; Sphe&aelig;roidibus, <I>that the
Square C P is equall to the Rectangle P S X; and al$o, that the Square C Q is equall to
the Rectangle Q V Y; that is, the Lines S X and V Y, are the Parameters of the Sections H S C
and M V C: But $ince the Triangles C P R and C Q T are alike; C R $hall have to C P, the
$ame Proportion that C T hath to C Q: And, therefore, the</I> (a) <I>Square C R $hall have</I>
<marg>(a) <I>By 22. of the
$ixth.</I></marg>
<I>to the Square C P, the $ame proportion that the</I>
<fig>
<I>Square C T hath to the Square C Q: There-
fore, al$o, the Line B N $hall be to the Line
S X, as the Line F O is to V Y: But H C was
to C M, as A C to C E: And, therefore, al$o,
their halves C P and C Q, are al$o to one
another, as A D and E G: And.</I> Permu-
tando, <I>C P is to A D, as C Q is to E G:
But it hath been proved, that A D is to B N,
as E G to F O; and B N to S X, as F O to
V Y: Therefore,</I> ex&aelig;quali, <I>C P $hall be
to S X, as C Q is to V Y. And, $ince the
Square C P is equall to the Rectangle P S X, and the Square C Q to the Rectangle Q V Y,
the three Lines S P, PC and S X $hall be proportionalls, and V Q, Q C and V Y $hal be
Proportionalls al$o: And therefore al$o S P $hall be to P C as V Q to Q C And as P C
is to C H, $o $hall Q C. be to C M: Therefore,</I> ex &aelig;quali, <I>as S P the Diameter of the
Portion H S C is to its Ba$e C H, $o is V Q the Diameter of the portion M V S the
Ba$e C M; and the Angles which the Diameter with the Ba$es do contain, are equall; and the
Lines S P and V Q are parallel: Therefore the Portions, al$o, H S C and M V C $hall be alike:

<P>Again, let there be two like Portions, contained betwixt Right

who$e Diameter is F G; and from the Point E, draw the

touching the Section A B C in C, and meeting with the Line

<I>And by 33 of the $ame, the Line C H touch-

Becau$e, now, that the Line C H toucheth the

whole is to the whole, $o is the part to the part: The remainder, therefore, D E is to the

<I>And it haveing been demon$trated, that C M is to M P, as C E to E A; L B $hall be to B M<*>

<head>LEMMA. VI.</head>
<P>And, therefore, let the things $tand as above; and de$cribe
yet another like Portion, contained betwixt a Right Line, and

is R S, that it may cut the Line F G in T; and prolong S R
unto the <I>L</I>ine C H in V, which meeteth the Section A B C in
X, and E F C in Y. I $ay, that B M hath to M D, a propor-

and of that which C D hath to D E.</P>
<P><I>For, we $hall fir$t demon$trate, that the Line C H toucheth the Section D R C in the
Point C; and that L M is to M D, as al$o N F to F T, and V Y to Y R, as C D is to E D.
And, becau$e now that L B is to B M, as C E is to E A; therefore, Compounding and Conver-

D E: The proportion, therefore, of B M to M D, is compounded of the proportion that
B M hath to L M, and of the proportion that L M hath to M D: Therefore, the proportion
of B M to M D, $hall al$o be compounded of the proportion that E A hath to A C, and of
that which C D hath to D E. In the $ame manner it $hal be demon$trated, that O F hath to

<P>Therfore repeating the fir$t figure, let the Portion have unto

It is to be demon$trated that the Portion being demitted into the

$hall continue inclined $o as that its Ba$e $hall not in the lea$t touch
the Surface of the Liquid, and its Axis $hall make an Angle with

Now, fora$much as the Portion is unto the Liquid in Gravity, as
the Square made of the Line <G>y</G> is to the Square B D; and $ince that
as the portion is unto the Liquid in Gravitie, $o is the part thereof
$ubmerged unto the whole Portion; and that as the part $ubmerged
is to the whole, $o is the Square T P to the Square B D; It follow-
eth that the Line <G>y</G> $hall be equall to T P: And therefore the Lines
M N and P T, as al$o the Portions A M Q and A P O $hall like-
wi$e be equall to each other. And $eeing that in the Equall and
Like Portions A P O L and A M Q L the Lines A O and A Q

Since therefore M V is Le$$er than double of V N, it is manife$t that

equall; as al$o their halves B S and B C: From
whence it followeth, that the Remainders S R and C R
are al$o equall: And, con$equently, that P Z and
M V, and V N and Z T, are lkiewi$e equall to one
another.</I></P>
<P>Since, therefore, that N V is le$$er
<marg>K</marg>

H N, and M V is le$$er than M H: Therefore, M V
is le$$er than double of H N, and much le$$er than
double of V N.</I></P>
<P>Therefore, the Portion $hall not abide, but $hall turn about,
<marg>L</marg>
$o, as that its Ba$e do not in the lea$t touch the Surface of
the Liquid; in regard that now when it toucheth in but one Point
only, it moveth upwards on the part towards A.] Tartaglia's <I>his Tran$la-
tion hath it thus,</I> Non ergo manet Portio $ed inclinabitur ut Ba$is ip$ius, nec $ecundum
unum tangat Superficiem Humidi, quon am nunc $ecundum unum tacta ip$a reclina-
tur<I>: Which we have thought fit in this manner to correct, from other Places of</I>
Archimedes, <I>that the $en$e might be the more per$picuous. For in the $ixth Propo$ition of this,
he thus writeth (as we al$o have it in the Tran$lation,)</I> The Solid A P O L, therefore, $hall
turn about, and its Ba$e $hall not in the lea$t touch the Surface of the Liquid. <I>Again,
in the $eventh Propo$ition</I>; From whence it is manife$t, that its Ba$e $hall turn about in
$uch manner, a that its Ba$e doth in no wi$e touch the Surface of the Liquid; For
that now when it toucheth but in one Point only, it moveth downwards on the part
towards L. <I>And that the Portion moveth upwards, on the part towards A, doth plainly ap-
pear: For $ince that the Perpendiculars unto the Surface of the Liquid, that pa$s thorow <*>, de
fall on the part towards A, and tho$e that pa$s thorow E, on the part towards L; it is nece$$ary
that the Centre</I> <G>w</G> <I>do move upwards, and the Centre E downwards.</I></P>
<P>It is therefore per$picuous, that the Portion $hall con$i$t, $o, as that
its Axis $hall make an Angle with the Liquids Surface greater than
the Angle <I>X.] For dr&aelig;wing a Line from A to X, prolong it nntill it do cut the Diamter</I>

turneth about, $o, as that the Ba$e doth not touch
the Liquid, the Axis $hall make an Angle with its
Surface greater than the Angle G; that is, than the
Angle Y: And, for that rea$on, much greater than
the Angle X.</I></P>

<P><I>If the Portion have the $ame proportion in Gravity to the

<P>Let the Portion have the $ame proportion in Gravity to tho
Liquid that the Square <I>X</I>O hath to the Square B D; and let
it be demitted into the Liquid $o inclined, as that its Ba$e touch
<fig>

a Plane thorow the Axis, erect unto
the Surface of the Liquid, let the
Section of the Solid, be the Section
of a Right-angled Cone, A P M L;
let the Section of the Surface of the
Liquid be I M; and the Axis of the
Portion and Diameter of the Section
B D; and let B D be divided as be-
fore; and draw PN parallel to IM
<p n=>391</p>
and touching the Section in P, and T P parallel to B D; and P S perpen-
dicular unto B D. It is to be demon$trated that the Portion $hall
<fig>
not $tand $o, but $hall encline until
that the Ba$e touch the Surface of
the Liquid, in one Point only, for let
the $uperior figure $tand as it was,
and draw O C, Perpendicular to B D;
and drawing a <I>L</I>ine from A to <I>X,</I>
prolong it to Q: A X $halbe equall
to <I>X</I> Q. Then draw O X parallel
to A Q. And becau$e the Portion
is $uppo$ed to have the $ame pro-
portion in Gravity to the Liquid
that the $quare X O hath to the
Square B D; the part thereof $ubmerged $hall al$o have the $ame
proportion to the whole; that is, the Square T P to the Square
<marg>A</marg>
B D; and $o T P $hall be equal to <I>X</I> O: And $ince that of the <I>P</I>ortions

and AP ML the Lines A Q and I M, which cut off equall <I>P</I>or-

not from the Extremity; it appeareth that that which is drawn from
the end or Extremity of the <I>B</I>a$e, $hall make the Acute Angle with
the Diameter of the whole <I>P</I>ortion le$set. <I>A</I>nd the Angle at <I>X</I>
<marg>D</marg>
being le$$e than the Angle at N, B C $hall be greater than B S; and
C R le$$er than S R: <I>A</I>nd, therfore O G $hall be le$$er than P Z;
and G <I>X</I> greater than Z T: Therfore P Z is greater than double of
Z T; being that O G is double of G X. Let P H be double to H T;
and drawing a Line from H to K, prolong it to <G>w.</G> The Center of
Gravity of the whole Portion $hall be K; the Center of the part
which is within the Liquid H, and that of the part which is above

$hall be demon$trated, both, that K H is perpendicular to the Surface
of the Liquid, and tho$e Lines al$o that are drawn thorow the Points
Hand <G>w</G> parallel to K H: And therfore the Portion $hall not re$t, but
$hall encline untill that its Ba$e do touch the Surface of the Liquid
in one Point; and $o it $hall continue. For in the Equall Portions
A O Q L and A P M L, the

equall Portions, $hall be dawn
from the Ends or Terms of the Ba$es;
and A O Q and A P M $hall be

the Angles at X and N are equall. And, therefore, if drawing HK,

along the $ame Right Lines $hall the

and its Axis $hall make with the

to be demon$trated in the $ame

that the Section may be A M O L, the Section

$hall be equall to the Square P F; and, by the

portions A P Q Land A M O L, the Lines A Q and I O which cut off equall Portions, the
fir$t from the Extreme term of the Ba$e, the la$t not from the Extremity; it followeth, that
A Q drawn from the Extremity, containeth a le$$er Acute Angle with the Diameter of the

<P><I>If the Portion have greater proportion in Gravity

<P>Again, let the Portion have greater proportion in

the right Line I V to fall betwixt the Portions A V Q L and A X D;
and let it be equall to <G>y,</G> and parallel to B D; and let it meet

A V Q L in V; and drawing a Line from A to I, prolong it unto

to I Q; and that A Q is parallel to V <G>w.</G> It is to be demon$trated,
that the Portion being demitted into the Liquid, and $o inclined,
as that its Ba$e touch not the Liquid, $hall $tand, $o, that its Ba$e
$hall be more $ubmerged in the Liquid, than to touch it Surface in
<foot>but</foot>
<p n=>399</p>
but one Point only. For let it be de-
<fig>
mitted into the Liquid, as hath been
$aid; and let it fir$t be $o inclined, as
that its Ba$e do not in the lea$t
touch the Surface of the Liquid. And
then it being cut thorow the Axis,
by a Plane erect unto the Surface of
the Liquid, let the Section of the
Portion be A N Z G; that of the
Liquids Surface E Z; the Axis of
the Portion and Diameter of the
Section B D; and let B D be cut in
the Points K and R, as before; and
draw N L parallel to E Z, and touching the Section A N Z G
in N, and N S perpendicular to
<fig>
B D. Now, $eeing that the Por-
tion is in Gravity unto the Liquid,
as the Square made of the Line
is to the Square B D; <G>y</G> $hall
be equall to N T: Which is to
be demon$trated as above: And,
therefore, N T is al$o equall to
V I: The Portions, therefore,
A V Q and E N Z are equall to
one another. And, $ince that in
the Equall and like Portions A V
Q L and A N Z G, there are drawn A Q and E Z, cutting off
equall Portions, that from the
<fig>
Extremity of the Ba$e, this not
from the Extreme, that which is
drawn from the Extremity of the
Ba$e, $hall make the Acute Angle
with the Diameter of the Portion
le$$er: and in the Triangles N L S
and V <G>w</G> C, the Angle at L is
greater than the Angle at <G>w</G>:
Therefore, B S $hall be le$$er
than B C; and S R le$$er than
C R: and, con$equently, N X
greater than V H; and X T le$$er than H I. Seeing, therefore,
that V Y is double to Y I; It is manife$t, that N X is greater than
double to X T. Let N M be double to M T: It is manife$t, from what
hath been $aid, that the Portion $hall not re$t, but will incline, untill
that its Bafe do touch the Surface of the Liquid: and it toucheth it in
one Point only, as appeareth in the Figure: And other things
<foot>Eee 2 $tanding</foot>
<p n=>400</p>
<fig>
$tanding as before, we will again
demon$trate, that N T is equall to
V I; and that the Portions A V Q
and A N Z are equall to each other.
Therefore, in regard, that in the
Equall and Like Portions A V Q L
and A N Z G, there are drawn
A Q and A Z cutting off equall Por-
tions, they $hall with the Diameters
of the Portions, contain equall
Angles. Therefore, in the Triangles
N L S and V <G>w</G> C, the Angles at
the Points <I>L</I> and <G>w</G> are equall; and the Right Line B S equall to
B C; S R to C R; N X to V H; and X T to H I: And, $ince
V Y is double to Y I, N X $hall be greater than double of X T.
Let therefore, N M be double to M T. It is hence again manife$t,
that the Portion will not remain, but $hall incline on the part
towards A: But it was $uppo$ed, that the $aid Portion did
touch the Surface of the Liquid in one $ole Point: Therefore,
its Ba$e mu$t of nece$$ity $ubmerge farther into the Liquid.</P>

<P>Finally, let the Portion have le$$er proportion to the Liquid

as the Portion is in Gravity to the Liquid, $o let the
Square made of the Line <G>y</G> be to the Square B D. <G>y</G> $hall be

<p n=>401</p>
the Right Line R Y in Y. We
<fig>
$hall demon$trate G H to be double
to H I, as it hathbeen demon$tra-
ted, that O G is double to G X.
Then draw G <G>w</G> touching the Section
A G Q L in G; and G C perpen di-
cular to B D; and drawing a Line
from A to I, prolong it to Q. Now
A I $hall be equall to I Q; and
A Q parallel to G <G>w.</G> It is to be
demon$trated, that the Portion being
demitted into the Liquid, and inclined, $o, as that its Ba$e touch
the Liquid, it $hall $tand $o incli-
<fig>
ned, as that its Axis $hall make
an Angle with the Surface of the
Liquid le$$e than the Angle <G>f;</G>
and its Ba$e $hall not in the lea$t
touch the Liquids Surface. For
let it be demitted into the Liquid,
and let it $tand, $o, as that its Ba$e
do touch the Surface of the Liquid
in one Point only: and the Portion
being cut thorow the Axis by a
Plane erect unto the Surface of the Liquid, let the Section of
<fig>
the Portion be A N Z L, the Section
of a Rightangled Cone; that of
the Surface of the Liquid A Z; and
the Axis of the Portion and Dia-
meter of the Section B D; and let
B D be cut in the Points K and R
as hath been $aid above; and draw
N F parallel to A Z, and touching
the Section of the Cone in the Point
N; and N T parallel to B D; and
N S perpendicular to the $ame. Be-
cau$e, now, that the Portion is in Gravity to the Liquid, as
the Square made of <G>y</G> is to the Square B D; and $ince that as the
Portion is to the Liquid in Gravity, $o is the Square N T to the
Square B D, by the things that have been $aid; it is plain, that
N T is equall to the Line <G>y</G>: And, therefore, al$o, the Portions
A N Z and A G Q are equall. And, $eeing that in the Equall and
Like Portions A G Q L and A N Z L; there are drawn from the
Extremities of their Ba$es, A Q and A Z which cut off equall Porti-
ons: It is obvious, that with the Diameters of the Portions they
<foot>make</foot>
<p n=>402</p>
make equall Angles; and that in the Triangles N F S and G <G>w</G> C
the Angles at F and <G>w</G> are equall; as al$o, that S B and B C, an<*>
S R and C R are equall to one another: And, therefore, N X an<*>
G Y are al$o equall; and X T and Y I. And $ince G H is doubl<*>
to H I, N X $hall be le$$er than double of X T. Let N M therefor<*>
be double to M T; and drawing a Line from M to K, prolong i<*>
unto E. Now the Centre of Gravity of the whole $hall be th<*>

that of the part which is above the Liquid in the Line prolonged
as $uppo$e in E. Therefore, by what was even now demon$trated
it is manife$t that the Portion $hall not $tay thus, but $hall incline, $o
as that its Ba$e do in no wi$e touch the Surface of the Liquid

GREATDUKE of <I>TUSC ANY:</I>
CONCERNING</head>
<head><I>The Natation of BODIES Upon, or Submer$ion
In, the WATER.</I></head>
<P>Con$idering (Mo$t Serene Prince) that the
publi$hing this pre$ent Treati$e, of $o
different an Argument from that which
<marg>His Nuncio Sl-
derio.</marg>
many expect, and which according to the
intentions I propo$ed in my ^{*} A$tronomi-
call <I>Advi$o,</I> I $hould before this time
have put forth, might peradventure make
$ome thinke, either that I had wholly
relinqui$hed my farther imployment
about the new Cele$tiall Ob$ervations,
or that, at lea$t, I handled them very
remi$$ely; I have judged fit to render an account, a$well of my
deferring that, as of my writing, and publi$hing this treati$e.</P>
<P>As to the fir$t, the la$t di$coveries of <I>Saturn</I> to be tricorporeall, and
of the mutations of Figure in <I>Venus,</I> like to tho$e that are $een in the
Moon, together with the Con$equents depending thereupon, have
not $o much occa$ioned the demur, as the inve$tigation of the times
of the Conver$ions of each of the Four Medicean Planets about <I>Ju-
piter,</I> which I lighted upon in <I>April</I> the year pa$t, 1611, at my being in
<I>Rome</I>; where, in the end, I a$$ertained my $elfe, that the fir$t and neere$t
to <I>Jupiter,</I> moved about 8 <I>gr.</I> &amp; 29 <I>m.</I> of its Sphere in an houre, make-
ing its whole revolution in one naturall day, and 18 hours, and almo$t
an halfe. The $econd moves in its Orbe 14 <I>gr. 13 min.</I> or very neer,
in an hour, and its compleat conver$ion is con$ummate in 3 dayes, 13
hours, and one third, or thereabouts. The third pa$$eth in an hour,
2 <I>gr. 6 min.</I> little more or le$s of its Circle, and mea$ures it all in 7
dayes, 4 hours, or very neer. The fourth, and more remote than the
re$t, goes in one houre, o <I>gr 54 min.</I> and almo$t an halfe of its Sphere,
and fini$heth it all in 16 dayes, and very neer 18 hours. But be-
cau$e the exce$$ive velocity of their returns or re$titutions, requires a
mo$t $crupulous preci$ene$$e to calculate their places, in times pa$t
<foot>Fff and</foot>
<p n=>402</p>
and future, e$pecially if the time be for many Moneths or Years; I
am therefore forced, with other Ob$ervations, and more exact than
the former, and in times more remote from one another, to correct
the Tables of $uch Motions, and limit them even to the $horte$t mo-
ment: for $uch exactne$$e my fir$t Ob$ervations $uffice not; not only
in regard of the $hort intervals of Time, but becau$e I had not as then
found out a way to mea$ure the di$tances between the $aid Planets
by any In$trument: I Ob$erved $uch Intervals with $imple relation
to the Diameter of the Body of <I>Jupiter</I>; taken, as we have $aid, by
the eye, the which, though they admit not errors of above a Minute,
yet they $uffice not for the determination of the exact greatne$s of the
Spheres of tho$e Stars. But now that I have hit upon a way of ta-
king $uch mea$ures without failing, $carce in a very few Seconds, I will
continue the ob$ervation to the very occultation of <I>JVPITER,</I>
which $hall $erve to bring us to the perfect knowledge of the Moti-
ons, and Magnitudes of the Orbes of the $aid Planets, together
<marg>The Authors
Ob$ervations of
the Solar Spots.</marg>
al$o with $ome other con$equences thence ari$ing. I adde to the$e
things the ob$ervation of $ome ob$cure Spots, which are di$cover-
ed in the Solar Body, which changing, po$ition in that, propounds
to our con$ideration a great argument either that the Sun revolves in
it $elfe, or that perhaps other Starts, in like manner as <I>Venus</I> and
<I>Mercury,</I> revolve about it, invi$ible in other times, by rea$on of their
$mall digre$$ions, le$$e than that of <I>Mercury,</I> and only vi$ible when
they interpo$e between the Sun and our eye, or el$e hint the truth
of both this and that; the certainty of which things ought not to be
contemned, nor omitted.</P>
<P><I>Continuall ob$ervation hath at la$t a$$ured me that the$e Spots are
matters contiguous to the Body of the Sun, there continually produced
in great number, and afterwards di$$olved, $ome in a $horter, $ome in a
longer time, and to be by the Conver$ion or Revolution of the Sun in it
$elfe, which in a Lunar Moneth, or thereabouts, fini$heth its Period,
caried about in a Circle, an accident great of it $elfe, and greater for
its Con$equences.</I></P>
<marg>The occa$ion in-
ducing the Au-
thor to write
this Treati$e.</marg>
<P>As to the other particular in the next place. ^{*} Many cau$es have
moved me to write the pre$ent Tract, the $ubject whereof, is the
Di$pute which I held $ome dayes $ince, with $ome learned men of
this City, about which, as your Highne$$e knows, have followed
many Di$cour$es: The principall of which Cau$es hath been the
Intimation of your Highne$$e, having commended to me Writing,
as a $ingular means to make true known from fal$e, reall from appa-
rent Rea$ons, farr better than by Di$puting vocally, where the
one or the other, or very often both the Di$putants, through too
<foot>great</foot>
<p n=>403</p>
greate heate, or exalting of the voyce, either are not under$tood,
or el$e being tran$ported by o$tentation of not yeilding to one ano-
ther, farr from the fir$t Propo$ition, with the novelty, of the
various Propo$als, confound both them$elves and their Auditors.</P>
<P>Moreover, it $eemed to me convenient to informe your High-
ne$$e of all the $equell, concerning the Controver$ie of which I
treat, as it hath been adverti$ed often already by others: and becau$e
the Doctrine which I follow, in the di$cu$$ion of the point in hand,
is different from that of <I>Ari$totle</I>; and interferes with his Principles,
I have con$idered that again$t the Authority of that mo$t famous
Man, which among$t many makes all $u$pected that comes not from
the Schooles of the Peripateticks, its farr better to give ones Rea$ons
by the Pen than by word of mouth and therfore I re$olved to write the
pre$ent di$cour$e: in which yet I hope to demon$trate that it was not
out of capritiou$ne$$e, or for that I had not read or under$tood
<I>Ari$totle,</I> that I $ometimes $werve from his opinion, but becau$e
$everall Rea$ons per$wade me to it, and the $ame <I>Ari$totle</I> hath
<marg><I>Ari$totle</I> prefers
Rea$on to the
Authority ofan
Author.</marg>
tought me to fix my judgment on that which is grounded upon
Rea$on, and not on the bare Authority of the Ma$ter; and it is
mo$t certaine according to the $entence of <I>Alcinoos,</I> that philo$opha-
<marg>The benefit of
this Argument.</marg>
ting $hould be free. Nor is the re$olution of our Que$tion in my
judgment without $ome benefit to the Univer$all, fora$much as
treating whether the figure of Solids operates, or not, in their going,
or not going to the bottome in Water, in occurrences of building
Bridges or other Fabricks on the Water, which happen commonly
in affairs of grand import, it may be of great availe to know the
truth.</P>
<P>I $ay therfore, that being the la$t Summer in company with certain
<marg>Conden$ation
the Propriety of
Cold, according
to the Peripate-
ticks.</marg>
Learned men, it was $aid in the argumentation; That Conden$ation
was the propriety of Cold, and there was alledged for in$tance, the
example of Ice: now I at that time $aid, that, in my judgment,
the Ice $hould be rather Water rarified than conden$ed, and my
<marg>Ice rather water
rarified, than
conden$ed, and
why:</marg>
rea$on was, becau$e Conden$ation begets diminution of Ma$s, and
augmentation of gravity, and Rarifaction cau$eth greater Lightne$s,
and augmentarion of Ma$$e: and Water in freezing, encrea$eth in
Ma$$e, and the Ice made thereby is lighter than the Water on which
it $wimmeth.</P>
<P><I>What I $ay, is manife$t, becau$e, the medium $ubtracting from the
whole Gravity of Sollids the weight of $uch another Ma$$e of the $aid</I>
<marg>In lib: 1. of Na-
tation of Bodies
Prop. 7.</marg>
<I>Medium; was</I> Archimedes <I>proves in his ^{*} Fir$t Booke</I> De In$identibus
Humido; <I>when ever the Ma$$e of the $aid Solid encrea$eth by Di$traction,
the more $hall the</I> Medium <I>detract from its entire Gravity; and le$$e,
when by Compre$$ion it $hall be conden$ed and reduced to a le$$e Ma$$e.</I></P>
<foot><I>Fff</I> 2 It</foot>
<p n=>404</p>
<marg>Figure operates
not in the Nata-
tion of Sollids.</marg>
<P>It was an$wered me, that that proceeded not from the greater Levity;
but from the Figure, large and flat, which not being able to pene-
trate the Re$i$tance of the Water, is the cau$e that it $ubmergeth not.
I replied, that any piece of Ice, of what$oever Figure, $wims upon
the Water, a manife$t $igne, that its being never $o flat and broad,
hath not any part in its floating: and added, that it was a manife$t
proofe hereof to $ee a piece of Ice of very broad Figure being thru$t
to the botome of the Water, $uddenly return to flote atoppe, which
had it been more grave, and had its $wimming proceeded from its
Forme, unable to penetrate the Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium,</I> that
would be altogether impo$$ible; I concluded therefore, that the Figure
was in $ort a Cau$e of the Natation or Submer$ion of Bodies,
but the greater or le$$e Gravity in re$pect of the Water: and there-
fore all Bodyes heavier than it of what Figure $oever they be, indiffe-
rently go to the bottome, and the lighter, though of any figure, float
indifferently on the top: and I $uppo$e that tho$e which hold other-
wi$e, were induced to that beliefe, by $eeing how that diver$ity
of Formes or Figures, greatly altereth the Velo$ity, and Tardity
of Motion; $o that Bodies of Figure broad and thin, de$cend
far more lea$urely into the Water, than tho$e of a more compacted
Figure, though both made of the $ame Matter: by which $ome
might be induced to believe that the Dilatation of the Figure might
reduce it to $uch amplene$$e that it $hould not only retard but wholly
impede and take away the Motion, which I hold to be fal$e. Upon
this Conclu$ion, in many dayes di$cour$e, was $poken much, and
many things, and divers Experiments produced, of which your
Highne$$e heard, and $aw $ome, and in this di$cour$e $hall have
all that which hath been produced again$t my A$$ertion, and what
hath been $ugge$ted to my thoughts on this matter, and for con-
firmation of my Conclu$ion: which if it $hall $uffice to remove that
(as I e$teem hitherto fal$e) Opinion, I $hall thinke I have not
unprofitably $pent my paynes and time. and although that come
not to pa$$e, yet ought I to promi$e another benefit to my $elfe,
namely, of attaining the knowledge of the truth, by hearing my
Fallacyes confuted, and true demon$trations produced by tho$e
of the contrary opinion.</P>
<P>And to proceed with the greate$t plainne$s and per$picuity that
I can po$$ible, it is, I conceive, nece$$ary, fir$t of all to declare
what is the true, intrin$ecall, and totall Cau$e, of the a$cending of
$ome Sollid Bodyes in the Water, and therein floating; or on the
contrary, of their $inking. and $o much the rather in a$much as I
cannot $atisfie my $elfe in that which <I>Ari$totle</I> hath left written on
this Subject.</P>
<marg>The cau$e of the
Natation &amp; $ub-</marg>
<P>I $ay then the Cau$e why $ome Sollid Bodyes de$cend to the
<foot>Bottom</foot>
<p n=>405</p>
Bottom of Water, is the exce$$e of their Gravity, above the
<marg>mer$ion of Sol-
ids in the Wa-
ter.</marg>
Gravity of the Water; and on the contrary, the exce$s of the
Waters Gravity above the Gravity of tho$e, is the Cau$e that others
do not de$cend, rather that they ri$e from the Bottom, and a$cend
to the Surface. This was $ubtilly demon$trated by <I>Archimedes</I> in
his Book Of the NATATION of BODIES: Conferred afterwards
by a very grave Author, but, if I erre not invi$ibly, as below for
defence of him, I $hall endeavour to prove.</P>
<P>I, with a different Method, and by other meanes, will endeavour
to demon$trate the $ame, reducing the Cau$es of $uch Effects to
more intrin$ecall and immediate Principles, in which al$o are di$co-
vered the Cau$es of $ome admirable and almo$t incredible Acci-
dents, as that would be, that a very little quantity of Water, $hould
be able, with its $mall weight, to rai$e and $u$tain a Solid Body, an
hundred or a thou$and times heavier than it.</P>
<P>And becau$e demon$trative Order $o requires, I $hall define cer-
tain Termes, and afterwards explain $ome Propo$itions, of which,
as of things true and obvious, I may make u$e of to my pre$ent pur-
po$e.</P>
<head>DEFINITION I.</head>
<P><I>I then call equally Grave</I> in $pecie, <I>tho$e Matters
of which equall Ma$$es weigh equally.</I></P>
<P>As if for example, two Balls, one of Wax, and the other of $ome
Wood of equall Ma$$e, were al$o equall in Weight, we $ay, that
$uch Wood, and the Wax are <I>in $pecie</I> equally grave.</P>
<head>DEFINITION II.</head>
<P><I>But equally grave in Ab$olute Gravity, we call two
Sollids, weighing equally, though of Ma$s they be
unequall.</I></P>
<P>As for example, a Ma$s of Lead, and another of Wood, that
weigh each ten pounds, I call equall in Ab$olute Gravity, though
the Ma$s of the Wood be much greater then that of the Lead.</P>
<P><I>And, con$equently, le$s Grave</I> in $pecie.</P>
<head>DEFINITION III.</head>
<P><I>I call a Matter more Grave</I> in $pecie <I>than another, of
which a Ma$s, equall to a Ma$s of the other, $hall
weigh more.</I></P>
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>406</p>
<P>And $o I $ay, that Lead is more grave <I>in $pecie</I> than Tinn, becau$e
if you take of them two equall Ma$$es, that of the Lead weigheth
more.</P>
<head>DEFINITION IV.</head>
<P><I>But I call that Body more grave ab$olutely than this, if
that weigh more than this, without any re$pect had to
the Ma$$es.</I></P>
<P>And thus a great piece of Wood is $aid to weigh more than a
little lump of Lead, though the Lead be <I>in $pecie</I> more heavy than
the Wood. And the $ame is to be under$tood of the le$s grave <I>in
$pecie,</I> and the le$s grave ab$olutely.</P>
<P>The$e Termes defined, I take from the Mechanicks two Princi-
ples: the fir$t is, that</P>
<head>AXIOME. I.</head>
<P><I>Weights ab$olutely equall, moved with equall Velocity,
are of equall Force and Moment in their operations.</I></P>
<head><I>DEFINITION V.</I></head>
<P>Moment, among$t Mechanicians, $igrifieth that
Vertue, that Force, or that Efficacy, with which
the Mover moves, and the Moveable re$i$ts.</P>
<P><I>Which Vertue dependes not only on the $imple Gravity, but on the
Velocity of the Motion, and on the diver$e Inclinations of the Spaces
along which the Motion is made: For a de$cending Weight makes a
greater</I> Impetus <I>in a Space much declining, than in one le$s declining;
and in $umme, what ever is the occa$ion of $uch Vertue, it ever retaines
the name of</I> Moment; <I>nor in my Judgement, is this $ence new in our
Idiome, for, if I mistake not, I think we often $ay; This is a weighty
bu$ine$$e, but the other is of $mall moment: and we con$ider lighter mat-
ters and let pa$s tho$e of Moment; a Metaphor, I $uppo$e, taken from
the Mechanicks.</I></P>
<P>As for example, two weights equall in ab$olute Gravity, being
put into a Ballance of equall Arms, they $tand in <I>Equilibrium,</I> nei-
ther one going down, nor the other up: becau$e the equality of the
Di$tances of both, from the Centre on which the Ballance is $uppor-
ted, and about which it moves, cau$eth that tho$e weights, the $aid
Ballance moving, $hall in the $ame Time move equall Spaces, that is,
$hall move with equall Velocity, $o that there is no rea$on for which
<foot>this</foot>
<p n=>407</p>
this Weight $hould de$cend more than that, or that more than this;
and therefore they make an <I>Equilibrium,</I> and their Moments continue
of $emblable and equall Vertue.</P>
<P>The $econd Principle is; That</P>
<head>AXIOME II.</head>
<P><I>The Moment and Force of the Gravity, is encrea$ed by
the Velocity of the Motion.</I></P>
<P>So that Weights ab$olutely equall, but conjoyned with Velocity
unequall, are of Force, Moment and Vertue unequall: and the
more potent, the more $wift, according to the proportion of the Ve-
locity of the one, to the Velocity of the other. Of this we have a
very pertinent example in the Balance or Stiliard of unequall Arms,
at which Weights ab$olutely equall being $u$pended, they do not
weigh down, and gravitate equally, but that which is at a greater
di$tance from the Centre, about which the Beam moves, de$cends,
rai$ing the other, and the Motion of this which a$cends is $low, and
the other $wift: and $uch is the Force and Vertue, which from the
Velocity of the Mover, is conferred on the Moveable, which receives
it, that it can exqui$itely compen$ate, as much more Weight added to
the other $lower Moveable: $o that if of the Arms of the Balance,
one were ten times as long as the other, whereupon in the Beames
moving about the Centre, the end of that would go ten times as far
as the end of this, a Weight $u$pended at the greater di$tance, may
$u$tain and poy$e another ten times more grave ab$olutely than it:
and that becau$e the Stiliard moving, the le$$er Weight $hall move
ten times fa$ter than the bigger. It ought alwayes therefore to be
under$tood, that Motions are according to the $ame Inclinations,
namely, that if one of the Moveables move perpendicularly to the
Horizon, then the other makes its Motion by the like Perpendicular;
and if the Motion of one were to be made Horizontally; that then
the other is made along the $ame Horizontall plain: and in $umme,
alwayes both in like Inclinations. This proportion between the
Gravity and Velocity is found in all Mechanicall In$truments: and
is con$idered by <I>Ari$totle,</I> as a Principle in his <I>Mechanicall Que$tions</I>;
whereupon we al$o may take it for a true A$$umption, That</P>
<head>AXIOME III.</head>
<P><I>Weights ab$olutely unequall, do alternately counterpoy$e
and become of equall Moments, as oft as their Gravi-
ties, with contrary proportion, an$wer to the Velocity of
their Motions.</I></P>
<foot>That</foot>
<p n=>408</p>
<P>That is to $ay, that by how much the one is le$s grave than the other,
by $o much is it in a con$titution of moving more $wiftly than that.</P>
<P>Having prefatically explicated the$e things, we may begin to en-
quire, what Bodyes tho$e are which totally $ubmerge in Water, and
go to the Bottom, and which tho$e that by con$traint float on the
top, $o that being thru$t by violence under Water, they return to
$wim, with one part of their Ma$s vi$ible above the Surface of the
Water: and this we will do by con$idering the re$pective operati-
on of the $aid Solids, and of Water: Which operation followes
the Submer$ion and $inking; and this it is, That in the Submer$ion
<marg>How the $ub-
mer$ion of So-
lids in the Wa-
ter, is effected.</marg>
that the Solid maketh, being depre$$ed downwards by its proper
Gravity, it comes to drive away the water from the place where it
$ucce$$ively $ubenters, and the water repul$ed ri$eth and a$cends
above its fir$t levell, to which A$cent on the other $ide it, as being a
grave Body of its own nature, re$i$ts: And becau$e the de$cending
Solid more and more immerging, greater and greater quantity of
Water a$cends, till the whole Sollid be $ubmerged; its nece$$ary to
compare the Moments of the Re$i$tance of the water to A$cen$ion,
with the Moments of the pre$$ive Gravity of the Solid: And if the
Moments of the Re$i$tance of the water, $hall equalize the Moments
<marg>What Solids
$hall float on the
Water.</marg>
of the Solid, before its totall Immer$ion; in this ca$e doubtle$s there
$hall be made an <I>Equilibrium,</I> nor $hall the Body $ink any farther.
But if the Moment of the Solid, $hall alwayes exceed the Moments
<marg>What Solids
$hall $inke to the
botome.</marg>
wherewith the repul$ed water $ucce$$ively makes Re$i$tance, that
Solid $hall not only wholly $ubmerge under water, but $hall de$cend
to the Bottom. But if, la$tly, in the in$tant of totall Submer$ion,
<marg>What Solids
$hall re$t in all
places of the Wa-
ter.</marg>
the equality $hall be made between the Moments of the prement
Solid, and the re$i$ting Water; then $hall re$t en$ue, and the $aid
Solid $hall be able to re$t indifferently, in what$oever part of the
water. By this time is manife$t the nece$$ity of comparing the
<marg>The Gravitie of
the Water and
<I>S</I>olid mu$t be
compared in all
Problems, of Na-
tation of Bodies.</marg>
Gravity of the water, and of the Solid; and this compari$on might
at fir$t $ight $eem $ufficient to conclude and determine which are the
Solids that float a-top, and which tho$e that $ink to the Bottom in the
water, a$$erting that tho$e $hall float which are le$$e grave <I>in $pecie</I>
than the water, and tho$e $ubmerge, which are <I>in $pecie</I> more grave.
For it $eems in appearance, that the Sollid in $inking continually,
rai$eth $o much Water in Ma$s, as an$wers to the parts of its own
Bulk $ubmerged: whereupon it is impo$$ible, that a Solid le$s grave
<I>in $pecie,</I> than water, $hould wholly $ink, as being unable to rai$e a
weight greater than its own, and $uch would a Ma$s of water equall
to its own Ma$s be. And likewi$e it $eems nece$$ary, that the graver
Solids do go to the Bottom, as being of a Force more than $ufficient
for the rai$ing a Ma$$e of water, equall to its own, though inferiour
in weight. Neverthele$s the bu$ine$s $ucceeds otherwi$e: and
<foot>though</foot>
<p n=>409</p>
though the Conclu$ions are true, yet are the Cau$es thus a$$igned
deficient, nor is it true, that the Solid in $ubmerging, rai$eth and
repul$eth Ma$$es of Water, equall to the parts of it $elf $ubmerged;
but the Water repul$ed, is alwayes le$s than the parts of the Solid
<marg>The water re-
pul$ed is ever le$s
than the parts of
the Sollid $ub-
merged.</marg>
$ubmerged: and $o much the more by how much the Ve$$ell in
which the Water is contained is narrower: in $uch manner that it
hinders not, but that a Solid may $ubmerge all under Water, with-
out rai$ing $o much Water in Ma$s, as would equall the tenth or
twentieth part of its own Bulk: like as on the contrary, a very
<marg><I>A</I> $mall quantity
of water, may
float a very
great Solid Ma$s.</marg>
$mall quantity of Water, may rai$e a very great Solid Ma$s, though
$uch Solid $hould weigh ab$olutely a hundred times as much, or

of the Solid $ubmerged H I K; as the Surface L M, namely, that of the

but comprehend of what Importance Velocity of Motion is, and how
it exactly compen$ates the defect and want of Gravity, will cea$e to
wonder, in con$idering that at the elevation of the Solid M, the great
Ma$s of water A B C D abateth very little, but the little Ma$s of

<P>In the ri$ing of the Solid M, its elevation hath the $ame proportion
to the circumfu$ed water E N S F, that the Surface of the $aid water,
hath to the Superficies or Ba$e of the $aid Solid M; which Ba$e hath

the aba$ement of the water E N S F, hath the $ame proportion, that the
Surface of the water E F, hath to the Surface of the water A D;
that is, that the whole Ma$s of the water E N S F, hath to the whole

$hall exceed in Velocity of <I>M</I>otion the water A B C D, a$much as it
on the other $ide is exceeded by that in quantity: whereupon their

which, in $umme, is as much as the water G D,

Re$i$tance is not made, but only by tho$e parts of the water, which
at the Motion of the $aid Solid do al$o move, and the$e are tho$e
only, which are comprehended by the two Superficies equidi$tant to
the Horizon, and their parallels, that comprehend the Altitude of the
Solid immerged in the water.</P>
<P>I conceive, I have by this time $ufficiently declared and opened
the way to the contemplation of the true, intrin$ecall and proper
Cau$es of diver$e Motions, and of the Re$t of many Solid Bodies i<*>
diver$e <I>Mediums,</I> and particularly in the water, $hewing how all i<*>
effect, depend on the mutuall exce$$es of the Gravity of the Movea-
bles and of the <I>Mediums</I>: and, that which did highly import, re-
moving the Objection, which peradventure would have begotter
much doubting, and $cruple in $ome, about the verity of my Con-
clu$ion, namely, how that notwith$tanding, that the exce$s of the
Gravity of the water, above the Gravity of the Solid, demitted into
it, be the cau$e of its floating and ri$ing from the Bottom to the Sur-
face, yet a quantity of water, that weighs not ten pounds, can rai$e
<foot>Solid</foot>
<p n=>419</p>
Solid that weighs above 100 pounds: in that we have demon$tra-
ted, That it $ufficeth, that $uch difference be found between the
Specificall Gravities of the <I>Mediums</I> and Moveables, let the particular
and ab$olute Gravities be what they will: in$omuch, that a Solid,
provided that it be Specifically le$s grave than the water, although
its ab$olute weight were 1000 pounds, yet may it be born up and
elevated by ten pounds of water, and le$s: and on the contrary, a-
nother Solid, $o that it be Specifically more grave than the water,
though in ab$olute Gravity it were not above a pound, yet all the
water in the Sea, cannot rai$e it from the Bottom, or float it. This
$ufficeth me, for my pre$ent occa$ion, to have, by the above declared
Examples, di$covered and demon$trated, without extending $uch
matters farther, and, as I might have done, into a long Treati$e:
yea, but that there was a nece$$ity of re$olving the above propo$ed
doubt, I $hould have contented my $elf with that only, which is
demon$trated by <I>Archimedes,</I> in his fir$t Book <I>De In$identibus hu-

jecteth the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes,</I> fir$t, as not con$entaneous with

that the Water $hould exceed the Earth in Gravity, $eeing on the
contrary, that the Gravity of water, increa$eth, by means of the parti-
<marg>His third Obje-
ction.</marg>
cipation of Earth. And he $ubjoyns pre$ently after, that he was
not $atisfied with the Rea$ons of <I>Archimedes,</I> as not being able with
that Doctrine, to a$$ign the cau$e whence it comes, that a Boat and
a Ve$$ell, which otherwi$e, floats above the water, doth $ink to the
Bottom, if once it be filled with water; that by rea$on of the e-
quality of Gravity, between the water within it, and the other water
without, it $hould $tay a top; but yet, neverthele$s, we $ee it to go to
the Bottom.</P>
<marg>His $ourth Ob-

<P>He farther addes, that <I>Ari$totle</I> had clearly confuted the Ancients,
who $aid, that light Bodies moved upwards, driven by the impul$e
<marg>The <I>Ancients</I>

of the more grave Ambient: which if it were $o, it $hould $eem of
nece$$ity to follow, that all naturall Bodies are by nature heavy,
<foot>Hhh2 and</foot>
<p n=>420</p>
and none light: For that the $ame would befall the Fire and Air,
if put in the Bottom of the water. And, howbeit, <I>Ari$totle</I> grants
a Pul$ion in the Elements, by which the Earth is reduced into a Sphe-
ricall Figure, yet neverthele$s, in his judgement, it is not $uch that it
can remove grave Bodies from their naturall places, but rather, that
it $end them toward the Centre, to which (as he $omewhat ob$curely
continues to $ay,) the water principally moves, if it in the interim
meet not with $omething that re$i$ts it, and, by its Gravity, thru$ts
it out of its place: in which ca$e, if it cannot directly, yet at lea$t
as well as it can, it tends to the Centre: but it happens, that light
Bodies by $uch Impul$ion, do all a$cend upward: but this properly
they have by nature, as al$o, that other of $wimming. He concludes,
<marg>The cau$es of
Natation &amp; Sub-
mer$ion, accord-
ing to the Peri-
pateticks.</marg>
la$tly, that he concurs with <I>Archimedes</I> in his Conclu$ions; but not
in the Cau$es, which he would referre to the facile and difficult Sepa-
ration of the <I>Medium,</I> and to the predominance of the Elements, $o
that when the Moveable $uperates the power of the <I>Medium</I>; as for
example, Lead doth the Continuity of water, it $hall move thorow it,
el$e not.</P>
<P>This is all that I have been able to collect, as produced again$t
<I>Archimedes</I> by <I>Signor Buonamico</I>: who hath not well ob$erved the
Principles and Suppo$itions of <I>Archimedes</I>; which yet mu$t be
fal$e, if the Doctrine be fal$e, which depends upon them; but is
contented to alledge therein $ome Inconveniences, and $ome Repug-
nances to the Doctrine and Opinion of <I>Ari$totle.</I> In an$wer to which
Objections, I $ay, fir$t, That the being of <I>Archimedes</I> Doctrine, $im-
<marg>The Authors an-
$wer to the fir$t
Objection.</marg>
ply different from the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle,</I> ought not to move any
to $u$pect it, there being no cau$e, why the Authority of this $hould
be preferred to the Authority of the other: but, becau$e, where the
decrees of Nature are indifferently expo$ed to the intellectuall eyes of
each, the Authority of the one and the other, lo$eth all anthentical-
ne$s of Per$wa$ion, the ab$olute power re$iding in Rea$on; therefore
I pa$s to that which he alledgeth in the $econd place, as an ab$urd con-
<marg>The Authors an-
$wer to the $e-
cond Objection.</marg>
$equent of the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes,</I> namely, That water $hould
be more grave than Earth. But I really find not, that ever <I>Archi-
medes</I> $aid $uch a thing, or that it can be rationally deduced from his
Conclu$ions: and if that were manife$t unto me, I verily believe, I
$hould renounce his Doctrine, as mo$t erroneous. Perhapsthis Dedu-
ction of <I>Buonamico,</I> is founded upon that which he citeth of the Ve-
$$el, which $wims as long as its voyd of water, but once full it $inks to
the Bottom, and under$tanding it of a Ve$$el of Earth, he infers again$t
<I>Archimedes</I> thus: Thou $ay$t that the Solids which $wim, are le$s grave
than water: this Ve$$ell $wimmeth: therefore, this Ve$$ell is le$$e grave
than water. If this be the Illation. I ea$ily an$wer, granting that this
Ve$$ell is le$$e grave than water, and denying the other con$equence,
<foot>namely,</foot>
<p n=>421</p>
namely, that Earth is le$s Grave than Water. The Ve$$el that $wims
occupieth in the water, not only a place equall to the Ma$s of the
Earth, of which it is formed; but equall to the Earth and to the Air
together, contained in its concavity. And, if $uch a Ma$s compoun-
ded of Earth and Air, $hall be le$s grave than $uch another quantity
of water, it $hall $wim, and $hall accord with the Doctrine of <I>Archi-
medes</I>; but if, again, removing the Air, the Ve$$ell $hall be filled
with water, $o that the Solid put in the water, be nothing but
Earth, nor occupieth other place, than that which is only po$$e$t by
Earth, it $hall then go to the Bottom, by rea$on that the Earth is
heavier than the water: and this corre$ponds well with the meaning
of <I>Archimedes.</I> See the $ame effect illu$trated, with $uch another
Experiment, In pre$$ing a Viall Gla$s to the Bottom of the water,
when it is full of Air, it will meet with great re$i$tance, becau$e it is
not the Gla$s alone, that is pre$$ed under water, but together with
the Gla$s a great Ma$s of Air, and $uch, that if you $hould take as
much water, as the Ma$s of the Gla$s, and of the Air contained in it,
you would have a weight much greater than that of the Viall, and of
its Air: and, therefore, it will not $ubmerge without great violence:
but if we demit only the Gla$s into the water, which $hall be when
you $hall fill the Gla$s with water, then $hall the Gla$s de$cend to
the Bottom; as $uperiour in Gravity to the water.</P>
<P>Returning, therefore, to our fir$t purpo$e; I $ay, that Earth is
more grave than water, and that therefore, a Solid of Earth goeth to
the bottom of it; but one may po$$ibly make a compo$ition of Earth
and Air, which $hall be le$s grave than a like Ma$s of Water; and
this $hall $wim: and yet both this and the other experiment $hall
very well accord with the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes.</I> But becau$e that
in my judgment it hath nothing of difficulty in it, I will not po$itive-
ly affirme that <I>Signor Buonamico,</I> would by $uch a di$cour$e object
unto <I>Archimedes</I> the ab$urdity of inferring by his doctrine, that Earth
was le$s grave than Water, though I know not how to conceive what
other accident he could have induced thence.</P>
<P>Perhaps $uch a Probleme (in my judgement fal$e) was read by
<I>Signor Buonamico</I> in $ome other Author, by whom peradventure it
was attributed as a $ingular propertie, of $ome particular Water, and
$o comes now to be u$ed with a double errour in confutation of <I>Ar-
chimedes,</I> $ince he $aith no $uch thing, nor by him that did $ay it was it
meant of the common Element of Water.</P>
<P>The third difficulty in the doctrine of <I>Archimedes</I> was, that he
<marg><I>T</I>he Authors an-
$wer to the third
Objection.</marg>
could not render a rea$on whence it aro$e, that a piece of Wood,
and a Ve$$ell of Wood, which otherwi$e floats, goeth to the bottom,
if filled with Water. <I>Signor Buonamico</I> hath $uppo$ed that a Ver$$ell
of Wood, and of Wood that by nature $wims, as before is $aid,
<foot>goes</foot>
<p n=>422</p>
goes to the bottom, if it be filled with water; of which he in the fol-
lowing Chapter, which is the 30 of the fifth Book copiou$ly di$cour$-
eth: but I ($peaking alwayes without diminution of his $ingular
Learning) dare in defence of <I>Archimedes</I> deny this experiment, being
certain that a piece of Wood which by its nature $inks not in Water,
$hall not $inke though it be turned and converted into the forme of a-
ny Ve$$ell what$oever, and then filled with Water: and he that would
readily $ee the Experiment in $ome other tractable Matter, and that is
ea$ily reduced into $everal Figures, may take pure Wax, and ma-
king it fir$t into a Ball or other $olid Figure, let him adde to it $o
much Lead as $hall ju$t carry it to the bottome, $o that being a graine
le$s it could not be able to $inke it, and making it afterwards into
the forme of a Di$h, and filling it with Water, he $hall finde that with-
out the $aid Lead it $hall not $inke, and that with the Lead it $hall de-
$cend with much $lowne$s: &amp; in $hort he $hall $atisfie him$elf, that the
Water included makes no alteration. I $ay not all this while, but that
its po$$ible of Wood to make Barkes, which being filled with water,
$inke; but that proceeds not through its Gravity, encrea$ed by the
Water, but rather from the Nailes and other Iron Workes, $o that
it no longer hath a Body le$s grave than Water, but one mixt of Iron
and Wood, more grave than a like Ma$$e of Water. Therefore let
<I>Signor Buonamico</I> de$i$t from de$iring a rea$on of an effect, that is
not in nature: yea if the $inking of the Woodden Ve$$ell when its full
of Water, may call in que$tion the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes,</I> which
he would not have you to follow, is on the contrary con$onant and a-
greeable to the Doctrine of the Peripateticks, $ince it aptly a$$ignes a
rea$on why $uch a Ve$$ell mu$t, when its full of Water, de$cend to the
bottom; converting the Argument the other way, we may with
$afety $ay that the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes</I> is true, $ince it aptly agre-
eth with true experiments, and que$tion the other, who$e Deducti-
ons are fa$tened upon etroneou$s Conclu$ions. As for the other point
hinted in this $ame In$tance, where it $eemes that <I>Benonamico</I> under-
$tands the $ame not only of a piece of wood, $haped in the forme of a
Ve$$ell, but al$o of ma$$ie Wood, which filled, <I>$cilicet,</I> as I believe, he
would $ay, $oaked and $teeped in Water, goes finally to the bottom
that happens in $ome poro$e Woods, which, while their Poro$ity is re-
pleni$hed with Air, or other Matter le$s grave than Water, are Ma$-
$es $pecificially le$s grave than the $aid Water, like as is that Viall of
Gla$s while$t it is full of Air: but when, $uch light Matter depart-
ing, there $ucceedeth Water into the $ame Poro$ities and Cavities,
there re$ults a compound of Water and Gla$s more grave than a like
Ma$s of Water: but the exce$s of its Gravity con$i$ts in the Matter
of the Gla$s, and not in the Water, which cannot be graver than it
$elf: $o that which remaines of the Wood, the Air of its Cavi-
<foot>tyes</foot>
<p n=>423</p>
ties departing, if it $hall be more grave <I>in $pecie</I> than Water, fil but its
Poro$ities with Water, and you $hal have a Compo$t of Water and
of Wood more grave than Water, but not by vertue of the Water re-
ceived into and imbibed by the Poro$ities, but of that Matter of the
Wood which remains when the Air is departed: and being $uch it
$hall, according to the Doctrine of <I>Archimedes,</I> goe to the bottom,
like as before, according to the $ame Doctrine it did $wim.</P>
<P>As to that finally which pre$ents it $elf in the fourth place, namely,
<marg>The Authors
an$wer to the
fourth Object-
ion.</marg>
that the <I>Ancients</I> have been heretofore confuted by <I>Ari$totle,</I> who
denying Po$itive and Ab$olute Levity, and truely e$teeming all Bo-
dies to be grave, $aid, that that which moved upward was driven by
the circumambient Air, and therefore that al$o the Doctrine of
<I>Archimedes,</I> as an adherent to $uch an Opinion was con-
victed and confuted: I an$wer fir$t, that <I>Signor Buonamico</I> in my
judgement hath impo$ed upon <I>Archimedes,</I> and deduced from his
words more than ever he intended by them, or may from his Propo-
$itions be collected, in regard that <I>Archimedes</I> neither denies, nor ad-
mitteth Po$itive Levity, nor doth he $o much as mention it: $o that
much le$s ought <I>Buonamico</I> to inferre, that he hath denyed that it
might be the Cau$e and Principle of the A$cen$ion of Fire, and other
Light Bodies: having but only demon$trated, that Solid Bodies
<marg>Of Natation,
Lib. 1. Prop. 7.</marg>
more grave than Water de$cend in it, according to the exce$s of their
Gravity above the Gravity of that, he demon$trates likewi$e, how the
<marg>Of Natation,
Lib. 1. Prop. 4.</marg>
le$s grave a$cend in the $ame Water, accordng to its exce$s of Gra-
ty, above the Gravity of them. So that the mo$t that can be gather-
ed from the Dem on$tration of <I>Archimedes</I> is, that like as the exce$s
of the Gravity of the Moveable above the Gravity of the Water, is
the Cau$e that it de$cends therein, $o the exce$s of the Gravity of
the water above that of the Moveable, is a $ufficient Cau$e why it de$-
cends not, but rather betakes it $elf to $wim: not enquiring whe-
ther of moving upwards there is, or is not any other Cau$e contrary
to Gravity: nor doth <I>Archimedes</I> di$cour$e le$s properly than if one
$hould $ay: If the South Winde $hall a$$ault the Barke with greater
<I>Impetus</I> than is the violence with which the Streame of the River car-
ries it towards the South, the motion of it $hall be towards the North:
but if the <I>Impetus</I> of the Water $hall overcome that of the Winde, its
motion $hall be towards the South. The di$cour$e is excellent and
would be unworthily contradicted by $uch as $hould oppo$e it, $aying:
Thou mi$-alledge$t as Cau$e of the motion of the Bark towards the
South, the <I>Impetus</I> of the Stream of the Water above that of the
South Winde; mi$-alledge$t I $ay, for it is the Force of the North
Winde oppo$ite to the South, that is able to drive the Bark towards
the South. Such an Objection would be $uperfluous, becau$e he which
alledgeth for Cau$e of the Motion the $tream of the Water, denies not
<foot>but</foot>
<p n=>424</p>
but that the Winde oppo$ite to the South may do the $ame, but only
affirmeth that the force of the Water prevailing over the Sout<*>
Wind, the Bark $hall move towards the South: and $aith no more
than is true. And ju$t thus when <I>Archimedes</I> $aith, that the Gravity
of the Water prevailing over that by which the moveable de$cends to
the Bottom, $uch moveable $hall be rai$ed from the Bottom to the Sur-
face alledgeth a very true Cau$e of $uch an Accident, nor doth he af-
firm or deny that there is, or is not, a vertue contrary to Gravity, called
by $ome Levity, that hath al$o a power of moving $ome Matters up
wards. Let therefore the Weapons of <I>Signor Buonamico</I> be directed a<*>

mentary Bodies an Intrin$ecall Principle and Naturall Inclination
to $hun the Centre of the Earth, and to move towards the Concave
of the Moon, $uch Bodies, without doubt, would more $wiftly a$cend
through tho$e <I>Mediums</I> that lea$t oppo$e the Velocity of the Moveable,
and the$e are the more tenuous and $ubtle; as is, for example, the

ence to a$cend more $wiftly through the Water, than the Fiery Exha-

that the $aid Exhalations do much more expeditiou$ly a$cend through
the Water, than through the Air; and that, con$equently, they are
moved by the Impul$e of the Ambient <I>Medium,</I> and not by an intrin-
$ick Principle that is in them, of avoiding the Centre of the Earth;
to which other grave Bodies tend.</P>

defect of Gravity, in relation to the <I>Medium</I>: for in that Action,
the Elements operate not, but only, $o far as they are grave or light:
therefore, to $ay that the Wood of the Firre $inks not, becau$e Air
predominateth in it, is no more than to $ay, becau$e it is le$s grave
than the Water. Yea, even the immediate Cau$e, is its being le$s

<marg><I>T</I>he immedi-

Moveable is le$s

Air, is the Cau$e of its le$s Gravity: Therefore, he that alledgeth the
predominancy of the Element for a Cau$e, brings the Cau$e of the
Cau$e, and not the neere$t and immediate Cau$e. Now, who knows
not that the true Cau$e is the immediate, and not the mediate?

than to ob$erve whether they $wim or $ink. So, that he who knows,
not whether $uch a Solid $wims, unle$s when he knows that Air pre-
dominates in it, knows not whether it $wim, unle$s he $ees it $wim,
for then he knows that it $wims, when he knows that it is Air that
predominates, but knows not that Air hath the predominance, unle$s
he $ees it $wim: therefore, he knows not if it $wims, till $uch time
as he hath $een it $wim.</P>

<P>The$e things explained and proved, I come to con$ider that which
offers it $elf, touching what the Diver$ity of figure given unto the
$aid Moveable hath to do with the$e Motions and Re$ts; and pro-
ceed to affirme, that,</P>
<head>THE OREME V.</head>
<P><I>The diver$ity of Figures given to this or that Solid</I>
<marg>Diver$ity of
Figure no Cau$e
of its ab$olute
Natation or Sub-
mer$ion.</marg>
<I>cannot any way be a Cau$e of its ab$olute Sinking o<*>
Swimming.</I></P>
<P>So that if a Solid being formed, for example, into a Spherical
Figure, doth $ink or $wim in the water, I $ay, that being formed
into any other Fi<*>ure, the $ame figure in the $ame water, $hal<*>
$ink or $wim: nor can $uch its Motion by the Expan$ion or by o<*>
ther mutation of Figure, be impeded or taken away.</P>
<marg>The Expan$i-
on of <I>F</I>igure, re-
tards the Veloci-
ty of the a$cent
or de$cent of the
Moveable in the
water; but doth
not deprive it of
all Motion.</marg>
<P>The Expan$ion of the Figure may indeed retard its Velocity, a$<*>
well of a$cent as de$cent, and more and more according as the $aid Fi-
gure is reduced to a greater breadth and thinne$s: but that it may bere
duced to $uch a form as that that $ame matter be wholly hindred from
moving in the $ame water, that I hold to be impo$$ible. In this I have
met with great contradictors, who producing $ome Experiments, and
in perticular a thin Board of Ebony, and a Ball of the $ame Wood
and $hewing how the Ball in Water de$cended to the bottom, and
the Board being put lightly upon the Water $ubmerged not, but re$t<*>
ed; have held, and with the Authority of <I>Ari$totle,</I> confirmed them
$elves in their Opinions, that the Cau$e of that Re$t was the breadt<*>
of the Figure, u able by its $mall weight to pierce and penetrate the
Re$i$tance of the Waters Cra$$itude, which Re$i$tance is readily o<*>
vercome by the other Sphericall Figure.</P>
<P>This is the Principal point in the pre$ent Que$tion, in which I per-
$wade my $elf to be on the right $ide.</P>
<P>Therefore, beginning to inve$tigate with the examination of ex-
qui$ite Experiments that really the Figure doth not a jot alter the de$-
cent or A$cent of the $ame Solids, and having already demon$tra-
ted that the greater or le$s Gravity of the Solid in relation to the Gra-
vity of the <I>Medium</I> is the cau$e of De$cent or A$cent: when ever we
<foot>would</foot>
<p n=>427</p>
would make proof of that, which about this Effect the diver$ity of Fi-
gure worketh, its nece$$ary to make the Experiment with Matter
wherein variety of Gravities hath no place. For making u$e of Mat-
ters which may be different in their Specifical Gravities, and meeting
with varieties of effects of A$cending and De$cending, we $hall al-
wayes be left un$atisfied whether that diver$ity derive it $elf really
from the $ole Figure, or el$e from the divers Gravity al$o. We may
remedy this by takeing one only Matter, that is tractable and ea$ily
reduceable into every $ort of Figure. Moreover, it wil be an excellent
expedient to take a kinde of Matter, exactly alike in Gravity unto the
Water: for that Matter, as far as pertaines to the Gravity, is in-
different either to A$cend or De$cend; $o that we may pre$ently ob-
$erve any the lea$t difference that derives it $elf from the diver$ity of
Figure.</P>
<P>Now to do this, Wax is mo$t apt, which, be$ides its incapacity of
<marg>An Experi-
ment in Wax,
that proveth Fi-
gute to have no
Operation in
Natation &amp; Sub-
mer$ion.</marg>
receiveing any $en$ible alteration from its imbibing of Water, is duct-
ile or pliant, and the $ame piece is ea$ily reduceable into all Figures:
and being <I>in $pecie</I> a very incon$iderable matter inferiour in Gravity
to the Water, by mixing therewith a little of the fileings of Lead it is
reduced to a Gravity exactly equall to that of the Water.</P>
<P>This Matter prepared, and, for example, a Ball being made there-
of as bigge as an Orange or biger, and that made $o grave as to
$ink to the bottom, but $o lightly, that takeing thence one only Grain
of Lead, it returnes to the top, and being added, it $ubmergeth to
the bottom, let the $ame Wax afterwards be made into a very broad
and thin Flake or Cake; and then, returning to make the $ame Ex-
periment, you $hall $ee that it being put to the bottom, it $hall, with the
Grain of Lead re$t below, and that Grain deducted, it $hall a$cend to
the very Surface, and added again it $hall dive to the bottom. And
this $ame effect $hall happen alwaies in all $ort of Figures, as wel re-
gular as irregular: nor $hall you ever finde any that will $wim with-
out the removall of the Grain of Lead, or $inke to the bottom unle$s
it be added: and, in $hort, about the going or not going to the Bot-
tom, you $hall di$cover no diver$ity, although, indeed, you $hall about
the quick and $low de$cent: for the more expatiated and di$tended
Figures move more $lowly a$wel in the diveing to the bottom as in
the ri$ing to the top; and the other more contracted and compact Fi-
gures, more $peedily. Now I know not what may be expected from
the diver$ity of Figures, if the mo$t contrary to one another operate
not $o much as doth a very $mall Grain of Lead, added or removed.</P>
<P>Me thinkes I hear $ome of the Adver$aries to rai$e a doubt upon
<marg>An objection a-
gain$t the Expe-
rim<*>t in Wa<*>s</marg>
my produced Experiment. And fir$t, that they offer to my con$idera-
tion, that the Figure, as a Figure $imply, and disjunct from the Matter
workes not any effect, but requires to be conjoyned with the Matter-
<foot>Iii 2 and,</foot>
<p n=>428</p>
and, furthermore, not with every Matter, but with tho$e on<*>
wherewith it may be able ro execute the de$ired operation. L<*>
as we $ee it verified by Experience, that the Acute and $harp Angl<*>
more apt to cut, than the Obtu$e; yet alwaies provided, that b<*>
the one and the other, be joyned with a Matter apt to cut, as
example, with Steel. Therefore, a Knife with a fine and $h<*>
edge, cuts Bread or Wood with much ea$e, which it will not do
the edge be blunt and thick: but he that will in$tead of Steel, t<*>
Wax, and mould it into a Knife, undoubtedly $hall never know <*>
effects of $harp and blunt edges: becau$e neither of them will c<*>
the Wax being unable by rea$on of its flexibility, to overcome <*>
hardne$s of the Wood and Bread. And, therefore, applying <*>
like di$cour$e to our purpo$e, they $ay, that the difference of Fig
will $hew different effects, touching Natation and Submer$ion, <*>
not conjoyned with any kind of Matter, but only with tho$e Mat<*>
which, by their Gravity, are apt to re$i$t the Velocity of the wat<*>
whence he that would elect for the Matter, Cork or other light wo<*>
unable, through its Levity, to $uperate the Cra$$itude of the wa<*>
and of that Matter $hould forme Solids of divers Figures, woul<*>
vain $eek to find out what operation Figure hath in Natation or S<*>
mer$ion; becau$e all would $wim, and that not through any prope
of this or that Figure, but through the debility of the Matter, wa<*>
ing $o much Gravity, as is requi$ite to $uperate and overcome
Den$ity and Cra$$itude of the water.</P>
<P>Its needfull, therefore, if wee would $ee the effect wrought by
Diver$ity of Figure, fir$t to make choice of a Matter of its na<*>
apt to penetrate the Cra$$itude of the water. And, for this e$$<*>
<marg>An Experi-
ment in Ebany,
brought to di$-
prove the Expe-
timent in Wax.</marg>
they have made choice of $uch a Matter, as fit, that being readily
duced into Sphericall Figure, goes to the Bottom; and it is Ebo
of which they afterwards making a $mall Board or Splinter, as thi<*>
a Lath, have illu$trated how that this, put upon the Surface of
water, re$ts there without de$cending to the Bottom: and making
the other$ide, of the $ame wood a Ball, no le$s than a hazell N<*>
they $hew, that this $wims not, but de$cendes. From which Exp<*>
ment, they think they may frankly conclude, that the Breadth of
Figure in the flat Lath or Board, is the cau$e of its not de$cending
the Bottom, fora$much as a Ball of the $ame Matter, not diffe<*>
from the Board in any thing but in Figure, $ubmergeth in the $a<*>
water to the Bottom. The di$cour$e and the Experiment hath rea<*>
$o much of probability and likely hood of truth in it, that it would
no wonder, if many per$waded by a certain cur$ory ob$ervati<*>
$hould yield credit to it; neverthele$s, I think I am able to di$cov<*>
how that it is not free from falacy.</P>
<P>Beginning, therefore, to examine one by one, all the particulars t<*>
<foot>have</foot>
<p n=>429</p>
have been produced, I $ay, that Figures, as $imple Figures, not only
<marg>Figure is un-
$eperable from
Corporeall Sub-
$tance.</marg>
operate not in naturall things, but neither are they ever $eperated
from the Corporeall $ub$tance: nor have I ever alledged them $tript
of $en$ible Matter, like as al$o I freely admit, that in our endeavour-
ing to examine the Diver$ity of Accidents, dependant upon the va-
riety of Figures, it is nece$$ary to apply them to Matters, which ob-
$truct not the various operations of tho$e various Figures: and I ad-
mit and grant, that I $hould do very ill, if I would experiment the in-
fluence of Acutene$$e of edge with a Knife of Wax, applying it to cut
an Oak, becau$e there is no Acutene$s in Wax able to cut that
very hard wood. But yet $uch an Experiment of this Knife, would
not be be$ides the purpo$e, to cut curded Milk, or other very yielding
Matter: yea, in $uch like Matters, the Wax is more commodious
than Steel; for finding the diver$ity depending upon Angles, more or
le$s Acute, for that Milk is indifferently cut with a Rai$or, and with
a Knife, that hath a blunt edge. It needs, therefore, that regard be
had, not only to the hardne$s, $olidity or Gravity of Bodies, which
under divers figures, are to divide and penetrate $ome Matters, but it
forceth al$o, that regard be had, on the other $ide, to the Re$i$tance
of the Matters, to be divided and penetrated. But $ince I have in
making the Experiment concerning our Conte$t, cho$en a Matter
which penetrates the Re$i$tance of the water; and in all figures de$-
cendes to the Bottome, the Adver$aries can charge me with no defect;
yea, I have propounded $o much a more excellent Method than they,
in as much as I have removed all other Cau$es, of de$cending or
not de$cending to the Bottom, and retained the only $ole and pure
variety of Figures, demon$trating that the $ame Figures all de$cende
with the only alteration of a Grain in weight: which Grain being
removed, they return to float and $wim; it is not true, therefore,
(re$uming the Example by them introduced) that I have gon about
to experiment the efficacy of Acutene$s, in cutting with Matters un-
able to cut, but with Matters proportioned to our occa$ion; $ince
they are $ubjected to no other variety, then that alone which depends
on the Figure more or le$s a cute.</P>
<marg>The an$wer to
the Objection a-
gain$t the Expe-
riment of the

<P>But let us proceed a little farther, and ob$erve, how that indeed
the Con$ideration, which, they $ay, ought to be had about the Election
of the Matter, to the end, that it may be proportionate for the ma-
king of our experiment, is needle$ly introduced, declaring by the ex-
ample of Cutting, that like as Acutene$s is in$ufficient to cut, unle$s
when it is in a Matter hard and apt to $uperate the Re$i$tance of the
wood or other Matter, which we intend to cut; $o the aptitude of
de$cending or notde$cending in water, ought and can only be known
in tho$e Matters, that are able to overcome the Renitence, and $upe-
rate the Cra$$itude of the water. Unto which, I $ay, that to make
di$tinction and election, more of this than of that Matter, on which to
<foot>impre$s</foot>
<p n=>430</p>
impre$s the Figures for cutting or penetrating this or that Body,
as the $olidity or obduratene$s of the $aid Bodies $hall be greater
or le$s, is very nece$$ary: but withall I $ubjoyn, that $uch di$tinct-
ion, election and caution would be $uperfluous and unprofitable, if
the Body to be cut or penetrated, $hould have no Re$i$tance, or
$hould not at all with$tand the Cutting or Penitration: and if the
Knife were to be u$ed in cutting a Mi$t or Smoak, one of Paper
would be equally $erviceable with one of <I>Dama$cus</I> Steel: and $o
by rea$on the water hath not any Re$i$tance again$t the Penitration
of any Solid Body, all choice of Matter is $uperfluous and needle$s,
and the Election which I $aid above to have been well made of a
Matter reciprocall in Gravity to water, was not becau$e it was ne-
ce$$ary, for the overcoming of the cra$$iitude of the water, but its
Gravity, with which only it re$i$ts the $inking of Solid Bodies: and
for what concerneth the Re$i$tance of the cra$$itude, if we narrowly
con$ider it, we $hall find that all Solid Bodies, as well tho$e that
$ink, as tho$e that $wim, are indifferently accomodated and apt to
bring us to the knowledge of the truth in que$tion. Nor will I
be frighted out of the belief of the$e Conclu$ions, by the Experi-
ments which may be produced again$t me, of many $everall Woods,
Corks, Galls, and, moreover, of $ubtle $lates and plates of all $orts
of Stone and Mettall, apt by means of their Naturall Gravity, to
move towards the Centre of the Earth, the which, neverthele$s, be-
ing impotent, either through the Figure (as the Adver$aries thinke)
or through Levity, to break and penetrate the Continuity of the
parts of the water, and to di$tract its union, do continue to $wimm
without $ubmerging in the lea$t: nor on the other $ide, $hall the
Authority of <I>Ari$totle</I> move me, who in more than one place, a$$ir-
meth the contrary to this, which Experience $hews me.</P>

<P>I return, therefore, to a$$ert, that there is not any Solid of $uch
Levity, nor of $uch Figure, that being put upon the water, doth not
divide and penetrate its Cra$$itude: yea if any with a more per-
$picatious eye, $hall return to ob$erve more exactly the thin Boards
of Wood, he $hall $ee them to be with part of their thickne$s under

water, and not only with their inferiour Superficies, to ki$$e the
Superiour of the water, as they of nece$$ity mu$t have believed, who
have $aid, that $uch Boards $ubmerge not, as not being able to di-
vide the Tenacity of the parts of the water: and, moreover, he
$hall $ee, that $ubtle $hivers of Ebony, Stone or Metall, when they
float, have not only broak the Continuity of the water, but are with
all their thickne$s, under the Surface of it; and more and more,
according as the Matters are more grave: $o that a thin Plate of
Lead, $hall be lower than the Surface of the circumfu$ed water, by
at lea$t twelve times the thickne$s of the Plate, and Gold $hall dive
<foot>below</foot>
<p n=>431</p>
below the Levell of the water, almo$t twenty times the thickne$s
of the Plate, as I $hall anon declare.</P>
<P>But let us proceed to evince, that the water yields and $ufters it
$elf to be penetrated by every the lighte$t Body; and therewithall
demon$trate, how, even by Matters that $ubmerge not, we may
come to know that Figure operates nothing about the going or
not going to the Bottom, $eeing that the water $uffers it $elf to be
penetrated equally by every Figure.</P>
<P>Make a Cone, or a Piramis of Cypre$s, of Firre, or of other

Wood of like Gravity, or of pure Wax, and let its height be $ome-
what great, namely a handfull, or more, and put it into the water
with the Ba$e downwards: fir$t, you $hall $ee that it will penetrate
the water, nor $hall it be at all impeded by the largene$s of the Ba$e,
nor yet $hall it $ink all under water, but the part towards the point
$hall lye above it: by which $hall be manife$t, fir$t, that that Solid
forbeares not to $ink out of an inabillity to divide the Continuity
of the water, having already divided it with its broad part, that in
the opinion of the Adver$aries is the le$s apt to make the divi$ion.
The Piramid being thus fixed, note what part of it $hall be $ub-
merged, and revert it afterwards with the point downwards, and
you $hall $ee that it $hall not dive into the water more than before,
but if you ob$erve how far it $hall $ink, every per$on expert in
Geometry, may mea$ure, that tho$e parts that remain out of the
water, both in the one and in the other Experiment are equall to
an hair: whence he may manife$tly conclude, that the acute Figure
which $eemed mo$t apt to part and penetrate the water, doth not
part or penetrate it more than the large and $pacious.</P>
<P>And he that would have a more ea$ie Experiment, let him take
two Cylinders of the $ame Matter, one long and $mall, and the o-
ther $hert, but very broad, and let him put them in the water, not
di$tended, but erect and endways: he $hall $ee, if he diligently
mea$ure the parts of the one and of the other, that in each of them
the part $ubmerged, retains exactly the $ame proportion to that
out of the water, and that no greater part is $ubmerged of that
long and $mall one, than of the other more $pacious and broad:
howbeit, this re$ts upon a very large, and that upon a very little
Superficies of water: therefore the diver$ity of Figure, occa$ioneth
neither facility, nor difficulty, in parting and penetrating the Con-
tinuity of the water; and, con$equently, cannot be the Cau$e of the
Natation or Submer$ion. He may likewi$e di$cover the non-
operating of variety of Figures, in ari$ing from the Bottom of the
water, towards the Surface, by taking Wax, and tempering it with
a competent quantity of the filings of Lead, $o that it may become
a con$iderable matter graver than the water: then let him make
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>432</p>
it into a Ball, and thru$t it unto the Bottom of the water; and
fa$ten to it as much Cork, or other light matter, as ju$t $erveth to
rai$e it, and draw it towards the Surface: for afterwards changing
the $ame Wax into a thin Cake, or into any other Figure, that
$ame Cork $hall rai$e it in the $ame manner to a hair.</P>
<P>This $ilenceth not my Antagoni$ts, but they $ay, that all the
di$cour$e hitherto made by me little importeth to them, and that it
$erves their turn, that they have demon$trated in one only parti-
cular, and in what matter, and under what Figure plea$eth them,
namely, in a Board and in a Ball of Ebony, that this put in the
water, de$cends to the Bottom, and that $tays atop to $wim:
and the Matter being the $ame, and the two Bodies differing in no-
thing but in Figure, they affirm, that they have with all per$picuity
demon$trated and $en$ibly manife$ted what they undertook; and
la$tly, that they have obtained their intent. Neverthele$s, I believe,
and thinke, I can demon$trate, that that $ame Experiment proveth
nothing again$t my Conclu$ion.</P>
<P>And fir$t, it is fal$e, that the Ball de$cends, and the Board not:

$hew the Board of Ebony not de$cending to the Bottom, they put it
not into the water, but upon the water, where being by a certain im-
pediment (as by and by we will $hew) retained, it is invironed, part
by water, and part by air, which thing is contrary to our agreement,

<I>into</I> the water, both $ink, but the Ball more $wiftly, and the Board
more $lowly; and $lower and $lower, according as it $hall be more
broad and thin, and of this Tardity the breadth of the Figure is the
true Cau$e: But the$e broad Boards that $lowly de$cend, are the
$ame, that being put lightly upon the water, do $wimm: Therefore,
if that were true which the Adver$aries affirm, the $ame numerical
Figure, would in the $ame numericall water, cau$e one while Re$t, and
another while Tardity of Motion, which is impo$$ible: for every per-
<marg>Every perticular

Tardity.</marg>
ticular Figure which de$cends to the Bottom, hath of nece$$ity its own
determinate Tardity and $lowne$s, proper and naturall unto it, accor-
ding to which it moveth, $o that every other Tardity, greater or le$$er
is improper to its nature: if, therefore, a Board, as $uppo$e of a foot
$quare, de$cendeth naturally with $ix degrees of Tardity, it is impo$$i-
ble, that it $hould de$cend with ten or twenty, unle$s $ome new impe-
diment do arre$t it. Much le$s can it, by rea$on of the $ame Figure
re$t, and wholly cea$e to move; but it is nece$$ary, that when ever it
re$teth, there do $ome greater impediment intervene than the breadth
of the Figure. Therefore, it mu$t be $omewhat el$e, and not the Fi-
gure, that $tayeth the Board of Ebany above water, of which Eigure
the only Effect is the retardment of the Motion, according to which
it de$cendeth more $lowly than the Ball. Let it be confe$$ed, there-
fore, rationally di$cour$ing, that the true and $ole Cau$e of the Ebanys
going to the Bottom, is the exce$s of its Gravity above the Gravity of
the water: and the Cau$e of the greater or le$s Tardity, the breadth
of this Figure, or the contractedne$s of that: but of its Re$t, it can
by no means be allowed, that the quallity of the Figure, is the Cau$e
thereof: a$well, becau$e, making the Tardity greater, according as
the Figure more dilateth, there cannot be $o immen$e a Dilatation, to
which there may not be found a corre$pondent immence Tardity.
without redu$ing it to Nullity of Motion; as, becau$e the Figures
produced by the Antagoni$ts for effecters of Re$t, are the $elf $ame
that do al$o go to the Bottom.</P>

or other Matter, of which a Ball a$cends from the Bottom of the water
<foot>Kkk to</foot>
<p n=>434</p>
to the Surface, more $lowly than a Ball of Ebony of the $ame bigne$$e,
$o that it is manife$t, that the Ball of Ebony more readily divideth the
water in de$cending, than the other in a$cending; as for Example, le<*>
the Wood be Walnut-tree. Then take a Board of Walnut-tree, like
and equall to that of Ebony of the Antagoni$ts, which $wims; and i<*>
it be true, that this floats above water, by rea$on of the Figure, unabl<*>
through its breadth, to pierce the Cra$$itude of the $ame, the other o<*>
Wallnut-tree, without all que$tion, being thru$t unto the Bottom, wil<*>
$tay there, as le$s apt, through the $ame impediment of Figure, to di<*>
vide the $aid Re$i$tance of the water. But if we $hall find, and b<*>
experience $ee, that not only the thin Board, but every other Figur<*>
of the $ame Wallnut-tree will return to float, as undoubtedly we $hall
then I mu$t de$ier my oppo$ers to forbear to attribute the floating o<*>
the Ebony, unto the Figure of the Board, in regard that the Re$i$tane
of the water is the $ame, as well to the a$cent, as to the de$cent, and th<*>
force of the Wallnut-trees a$cen$ion, is le$$e than the Ebonys force i<*>
going to the Bottom.</P>
<P>Nay, I will $ay more, that if we $hall con$ider Gold in compari$o
<marg>An Experi-
ment in Gold, to
prove the non-
operating of Fi-
gure in Natation
and Submer$ion.</marg>
of water, we $hall find, that it exceeds it in Gravity almo$t twenty times
$o that the Force and Impetus, wherewith a Ball of Gold goes to th<*>
Bottom, is very great. On the contrary, there want not matters, a<*>
Virgins Wax, and $ome Woods, which are not above a fiftieth part le<*>
grave than water, whereupon their A$cen$ion therein is very $low, an<*>
a thou$and times weaker than the <I>Impetus</I> of the Golds de$cent: y<*>
notwith$tanding, a plate of Gold $wims without de$cending to th<*>
Bottom, and, on the contrary, we cannot make a Cake of Wax, or thi<*>
Board of Wood, which put in the Bottom of the Water, $hall re$t the<*>
without a$cending. Now if the Figure can ob$truct the Penetratio<*>
and impede the de$cent of Gold, that hath $o great an <I>Impetus,</I> ho<*>
can it choo$e but $uffice to re$i$t the $ame Penetration of the other ma<*>
ter in a$cending, when as it hath $carce a thou$andth part of the <I>Impet<*></I>
that the Gold hath in de$cending? Its therefore, nece$$ary, that th<*>
which $u$pends the thin Plate of Gold, or Board of Ebony, upon t<*>
water, be $ome thing that is wanting to the other Cakes and Boards <*>
Matters le$s grave than the water; $ince that being put to the Botton
and left at liberty, they ri$e up to the Surface, without any ob$tructio<*>
But they want not for flatne$s and breadth of Figure: Therefore, t<*>
$paciou$ne$$e of the Figure, is not that which makes the Gold and Ebon
to $wim.</P>
<P>And, becau$e, that the exce$s of their Gravity above the Gravity <*>
the water, is que$tionle$s the Cau$e of the $inking of the flat piece <*>
Ebony, and the thin Plate of Gold, when they go to the Bottom, ther<*>
fore, of nece$$ity, when they float, the Cau$e of their $taying abo<*>
water, proceeds from Levity, which in that ca$e, by $ome Acciden<*>
<foot>peradventure</foot>
<p n=>435</p>
peradventure not hitherto ob$erved, cometh to meet with the $aid
Board, rendering it no longer as it was before, whil$t it did fink more
ponderous than the water, but le$s.</P>
<P>Now, let us return to take the thin Plate of Gold, or of Silver, or the
thin Board of Ebony, and let us lay it lightly upon the water, $o that it
$tay there without $inking, and diligently ob$erve its effect. An<*>
fir$t, $ee how fal$e the a$$ertion of <I>Aristotle,</I> and our oponents is, to wit,
that it $tayeth above water, through its unability to pierce and pene-
trate the Re$i$tance of the waters Cra$$itude: for it will manife$tly
appear, not only that the $aid Plates have penetrated the water, but
al$o that they are a con$iderable matter lower than the Surface of the
$ame, the which continueth eminent, and maketh as it were a Rampert
on all $ides, round about the $aid Plates, the profundity of which they
$tay $wimming: and, according as the $aid Plates $hall be more grave
than the water, two, four, ten or twenty times, it is nece$$ary, that
their Superficies do $tay below the univer$all Surface of the water, $o
much more, than the thickne$s of tho$e Plates, as we $hal more di$tinctly
$hew anon. In the mean $pace, for the more ea$ie under$tanding of what
I $ay, ob$erve with me a little the pre$ent
<fig>
Scheme: in which let us $uppo$e the Surface
of the water to be di$tended, according to the
Lines F L D B, upon which if one $hall put a
board of matter $pecifically more grave than
water, but $o lightly that it $ubmetge not, it
$hall not re$t any thing above, but $hall enter with its whole thickne$s
into the water: and, moreover, $hall $ink al$o, as we $ee by the Board
A I, O I, who$e breadth is wholly $unk into the water, the little Ram-
perts of water L A and D O incompa$$ing it, who$e Superficies is no-
tably higher than the Superficies of the Board. See now whether it be
true, that the $aid Board goes not to the Bottom, as being of Figure
unapt to penetrate the Cra$$itude of the water.</P>
<P>But, if it hath already penetrated, and overcome the Continuity of
<marg>Why $olids

ted the Water,

to a totail Sub-
mer$ion.</marg>
the water, &amp; is of its own nature more grave than the $aid water, why
doth it not proceed in its $inking, but $top and $u$pend its $elf within
that little dimple or cavitie, which with its pondero$ity it hath made in
the water? I an$wer; becau$e that in $ubmerging it $elf, $o far as till its
Superficies come to the Levell with that of the water, it lo$eth a part
of its Gravity, and lo$eth the re$t of it as it $ubmergeth &amp; de$cends be-
neath the Surface of the water, which maketh Ramperts and Banks
round about it, and it $u$taines this lo$s by means of its drawing after it,
and carrying along with it, the Air that is above it, and by Contact ad-
herent to it, which Air $ucceeds to fill the Cavity that is invironed by
the Ramperts of water: $o that that which in this ca$e de$cends and is
placed in the water, is not only the Board of Ebony or Plate of Iron,
<foot>Kkk 2 but</foot>
<p n=>436</p>
but a compo$ition of Ebony and Air, from which re$ulteth a Solid
no longer $uperiour in Gravity to the water, as was the $imple Ebony,
or the $imple Gold. And, if we exactly con$ider, what, and how
great the Solid is, that in this Experiment enters into the water, and
contra$ts with the Gravity of the $ame, it will be found to be all that
which we find to be beneath the Surface of the water, the which is
an aggregate and Compound of a Board of Ebony, and of almo$t
the like quantity of Air, or a Ma$s compounded of a Plate of Lead,
and ten or twelve times as much Air. But, Genrlemen, you that
are my Antagoni$ts in our Que$tion, we require the Identity of
Matter, and the alteration only of the Figure; therefore, you mu$t
remove that Air, which being conjoyned with the Board, makes it
become another Body le$s grave than the Water, and put only the
Ebony into the Water, and you $hall certainly $ee the Board de$cend
to the Bottom; and, if that do not happen, you have got the day.
<marg>How to $epe-
rate the Air from
Solids in demit-
ting them into
the water.</marg>
And to $eperate the Air from the Ebony, there needs no more but
only to bath the Superficies of the $aid Board with the $ame Water:
for the Water being thus interpo$ed between the Board and the Air,
the other circumfu$ed Water $hall run together without any impedi-
ment, and $hall receive into it the $ole and bare Ebony, as it was to do.</P>
<P>But, me thinks I hear $ome of the Adver$aries cunningly oppo$ing
this, and telling me, that they will not yield, by any means, that
their Board be wetted, becau$e the weight added thereto by the
Water, by making it heavier than it was before, draws it to the
Bottom, and that the addition of new weight is contrary to our a-
greement, which was, that the Matter be the $ame.</P>
<P>To this, I an$wer, fir$t; that treating of the operation of Figure
in Bodies put into the Water, none can $uppo$e them to be put into
the Water without being wet; nor do I de$ire more to be done to
the Board, then I will give you leave to do to the Ball. Moreover,
it is untrue, that the Board $inks by vertue of the new Weight added
to it by the Water, in the $ingle and $light bathing of it: for I will
put ten or twenty drops of Water upon the $ame Board, whil$t it is
$u$tained upon the water, which drops, becau$e not conjoyned with
the other Water circumfu$ed, $hall not $o encrea$e the weight of it, as
to make it $ink: but if the Board being taken out, and all the water
wiped off that was added thereto, I $hould bath all its Superficies
with one only very $mall drop, and put it again upon the water, with-
out doubt it $hall $ink, the other Water running to cover it, not be-
ing retained by the $uperiour Air; which Air by the interpo$ition of
the thin vail of water, that takes away its Contiguity unto the Ebony,
$hall without Renitence be $eperated, nor doth it in the lea$t oppo$e
the $ucce$$ion of the other Water: but rather, to $peak better, it
$hall de$cend freely; becau$e it $hall be all invironed and covered
<foot>with</foot>
<p n=>437</p>
with water, as $oon as its $uperiour Superficies, before vailed with
water, doth arrive to the Levell of the univer$all Surface of the $aid
water. To $ay, in the next place, that water can encrea$e the weight
<marg>Water hath

of things that are demitted into it, is mo$t fal$e <*> for water hath no
Gravity in water, $ince it de$cends not: yea, if we would well con$i-
der what any immen$e Ma$s of water doth put upon a grave Body;
<marg>Water de-
mini$heth the
Gravity of So-
lids immerged
therein.</marg>
that is placed in it, we $hall find experimentally, that it, on the con-
trary, will rather in a great part demini$h the weight of it, and that
we may be able to lift an huge Stone from the Bottom of the water,
which the water being removed, we are not able to $tir. Nor let
them tell me by way of reply, that although the $uperpo$ed water
augment not the Gravity of things that are in it, yet it increa$eth the
pondero$ity of tho$e that $wim, and are part in the water and part

in the Air, as is $een, for Example, in a Bra$s Ketle, which whil$t it
is empty of water, and repleni$hed only with Air $hall $wim, but
pouring of Water therein, it $hall become $o grave, that it $hall $ink
to the Bottom, and that by rea$on of the new weight added thereto.
To this I will return an$wer, as above, that the Gravity of the
Water, contained in the Ve$$el is not that which $inks it to the Bot-
tom, but the proper Gravity of the Bra$s, $uperiour to the Specificall
<marg>An Ocean $uf-
ficeth not to
$ink a Ve$$el $pe-
cifically le$s
grave than wa-
ter.</marg>
Gravity of the Water: for if the Ve$$el were le$s grave than
water, the Ocean would not $uffice to $ubmerge it. And, give me
leave to repeat it again, as the fundamentall and principall point in
this Ca$e, that the Air contained in this Ve$$el before the infu$ion of
the Water, was that which kept it a-float, $ince that there was made
<marg>Air, the Cau$e
of the Natation
of empty Ve$$els
of Matters gra-
ver <I>in $pecie</I> than
the water.</marg>
of it, and of the Bra$s, a Compo$ition le$s grave than an equall quanti-
ty of Water: and the place that the Ve$$el occupyeth in the
Water whil$t it floats, is not equall to the Bra$s alone, but to the
Bra$s and to the Air together, which filleth that part of the Ve$$el
that is below the Levell of the water: Moreover, when the Water
is infu$ed, the Air is removed, and there is a compo$ition made of
Bra$s and of water, more grave <I>in $pecie</I> than the $imple water, but
not by vertue of the water infu$ed, as having greater Specifick
Gravity than the other water, but through the proper Gravity of
the Bra$s, and through the alienation of the Air. Now, as he that
$hould $ay that Bra$s, that by its nature goes to the Bottom, being
<marg>Neither Figure,
nor the breadth
of Figure, is the

tion.</marg>
formed into the Figure of a Ketle, acquireth from that Figure a
vertue of lying in the Water without $inking, would $ay that which
is fal$e; becau$e that Bra$s fa$hioned into any whatever Figure,
goeth always to the Bottom, provided, that that which is put into the
water be $imple Bra$s; and it is not the Figure of the Ve$$el that
makes the Bra$s to float, but it is becau$e that that is not purely
Bra$s which is put into the water, but an aggregate of Bra$s and of
Air: $o is it neither more nor le$s fal$e, that a thin Plate of Bra$s
<foot>or</foot>
<p n=>438</p>
or of Ebony, $wims by vertue of its dilated &amp; broad Figure: for <*>
truth is, that it bares up without $ubmerging, becau$e that that whi<*>
is put in the water, is not pure Bra$s or $imple Ebony, but an a<*>
gregate of Bra$s and Air, or of Ebony and Air. And, this is n<*>
contrary unto my Conclu$ion, the which, (having many a time $e<*>
Ve$$els of Mettall, and thin pieces of diver$e grave Matters float, <*>
vertue of the Air conjoyned with them) did affirm, That Figu<*>
was not the Cau$e of the Natation or Submer$ion of $uch Solids
were placed in the water. Nay more, I cannot omit, but mu$t to
my Antagoni$ts, that this new conceit of denying that the Superfi-
cies of the Board $hould be bathed, may beget in a third per$on a
opinion of a poverty of Arguments of defence on their part, $in<*>
that $uch bathing was never in$i$ted upon by them in the beginnir

<*>ture apt to de$cend to the Bottom, being placed lightly on the water
$ubmerge not, unle$s they be fir$t thorowly bathed; and have found,
that one of the$e Bodies having de$cended to the Bottom, by conveigh-

$tays and abideth in the $ame manner, till $uch time, as the a$$i$tance
of the conjoyned Air is taken away. And to this effect, I have taken a
Ball of Wax, and made it with a little Lead, $o grave, that it lea$urely
<*>$cends to the Bottom, making with all its Superficies very $mooth and
pollite: and this being put gently into the water, almo$t wholly $ub-

tence, by how much greater the Velocity is: and the Cau$e of this
Re$i$tance depends not on Cra$$itude, or any other thing that ab$o-
lutely oppo$eth Divi$ion, but becau$e that the parts of the water
divided, in giving way to that Solid that is moved in it, are them-
$elves al$o nece$$itated locally to move, $ome to the one $ide, and $ome
to the other, and $ome downwards: and this mu$t no le$s be done
by the waves before the Ship, or other Body $wimming through the
water, than by the po$teriour and $ub$equent; becau$e, the Ship
proceeding forwards, to make it $elf a way to receive its Bulk, it is
requi$ite, that with the Prow it repul$e the adjacent parts of the
water, as well on one hand as on the other, and that it move them
as much tran$ver$ly, as is the half of the breadth of the Hull: and
the like removall mu$t tho$e waves make, that $ucceeding the Poump
do run from the remoter parts of the Ship towards tho$e of the
middle, $ucce$$ively to repleni$h the places, which the Ship in ad-
vancing forwards, goeth, leaving vacant. Now, becau$e, all Moti-
<marg>Bodies moved
a certain $pace in
a certain Time,
by a certain
power, cannot be
moved the
$ame $pace, and
in a $horter time,
but by a greater

tions are made in Time, and the longer in greater time: and it being
moreover true, that tho$e Bodies that in a certain time are moved
by a certain power $uch a certain $pace, $hall not be moved the $ame
$pace, and in a $horter Time, unle$s by a greater Power: therefore,
the broader Ships move $lower than the narrower, being put on by
an equall Force: and the $ame Ve$$el requires $o much greater
force of Wind, or Oars, the fa$ter it is to move.</P>

not to be divided by a Board, or other Solid Body, palpable unto the
band, the Sector being alwayes required to be more $harp than the Solid
to be cut. Solid Bodies, therefore, do only move, and not divide the</I>

<I>Water, when put into it; who$e parts being before divided to the ex-
treame$t minuity, and therefore capable of being moved, either many of
them at once, or few, or very few, they $oon give place to every $mall Cor-
pu$cle, that de$cends in the $ame: for that, it being little and light, de-
$cending in the Air, and arriving to the Surface of the Water, it meets
with Particles of Water more $mall, and of le$s Re$i$tance again$t
Motion and Extru$ion, than is its own prement and extru$ive force,
whereupon it $ubmergeth, and moveth $uch a portion of them, as is pro-

<marg>If there were

Plate of Matter, equall in Gravity with Water, (which likewi$e will
not happen, in ca$e we proceed with dexterity) we may ob$erve that that
Re$i$tance is a very different thing from that which the Adver$aries pro-
duce for the Cau$e of the Natation of the Plate of Lead or Board of Ebo-
ny, for that one may make a Board of Ebony, which being put upon the
Water $wimmeth, and cannot be $ubmerged, no not by the addition of an

thed, not only $inks, though the $aid Lead be taken away, but though
moreover a quantity of Cork, or of $ome other light Body fa$tened to it,
$ufficeth not to hinder it from $inking unto the bottome: $o that you
$ee, that although it were granted that there is a certain $mall Re$i$t-
ance of Divi$ion found in the $ubstance of the Water, yet this hath no-
thing to do with that Cau$e which $upports the Board above the Water,
with a Re$i$tance an hundred times greater than that which men can
find in the parts of the Water: nor let them tell me, that only the Sur-</I>

<I>face of the Water hath $uch Re$i$tance, and not the internall parts, or
that $uch Re$i$tance is found greate$t in the beginning of the Submer$ion,
as it al$o $eems that in the beginning, Motion meets with greater oppo$iti-

<I>all that, to be still the $ame: Moreover, that Hair which dren <*>
Beam through the Water, is likewi$e to divide the upperparts, <*>
al$o to begin the Motion, and yet it begins it, and yet it divides it: <*>
finally, let the Board of Ebony be put in the midway, betwixt the botto<*>
and the top of the Water, and let it there for a while be $u$pended <*>
$etled, and afterwards let it be left at liberty, and it will instantly b<*>
its Motion, and will continue it unto the bottome. Nay, more, the Bo<*>
$o $oon as it is dimitted upon the Water, hath not only begun to m<*>
and divide it, but is for a good $pace dimerged into it.</I></P>
<P>Let us receive it, therefore, for a true and undoubted Conclu<*>
on, That the Water hath not any Renitence again$t $imple Div<*>
on, and that it is not po$$ible to find any Solid Body, be it of wh<*>
Figure it will, which being put into the Water, its Motion upwa<*>
or downwards, according as it exceedeth, or $hall be exceeded <*>
the Water in Gravity (although $uch exce$$e and difference be <*>
$en$ible) $hall be prohibited, and taken away, by the Cra$$itude <*>
the $aid Water. When, therefore, we $ee the Board of Ebony, <*>
of other Matter, more grave than the Water, to $tay in the Co<*>
fines of the Water and Air, without $ubmerging, we mu$t have <*>
cour$e to $ome other Originall, for the inve$ting the Cau$e of th<*>
Effect, than to the breadth of the Figure, unable to overcome <*>
Renitence with which the Water oppo$eth Divi$ion, $ince there <*>
no Re$i$tance; and from that which is not in being, we can exp<*>
no Action. It remains mo$t true, therefore, as we have $aid before, <*>
this $o $ucceds, for that that which in $uch manner put upon the v<*>
ter, not the $ame Body with that which is put <I>into</I> the Water: beca<*>
this which is put <I>into</I> the Water, is the pure Board of Ebony, wh<*>
for that it is more grave than the Water, $inketh, and that which
put <I>upon</I> the Water, is a Compo$ition of Ebony, and of $o m<*>
Air, that both together are $pecifically le$s grave than the Wa<*>
and therefore they do not de$cend.</P>
<P>I will farther confirm this which I $ay. Gentlemen, my Anta<*>
ni$ts, we are agreed, that the exce$s or defect of the Gravity of <*>
Solid, unto the Gravity of the Water, is the true and proper Ca<*>
of Natation or Submer$ion.</P>
<marg>Great Caution
to be had in ex-
perimenting the
operation of Fi-
gure in Natati-
on.</marg>
<P>Now, if you will $hew that be$ides the former Cau$e, there is a<*>
ther which is $o powerfull, that it can hinder and remove the S<*>
mer$ion of tho$e very Solids, that by their Gravity $ink, and if y<*>
will $ay, that this is the breadth or amplene$s of Figure, you are o<*>
lieged, when ever you would $hew $uch an Experiment, fir$t to ma<*>
the circum$tances certain, that that Solid which you put into <*>
Water, be not le$s grave <I>in $pecie</I> than it, for if you $hould not do<*>
any one might with rea$on $ay, that not the Figure, but the Levi<*>
was the cau$e of that Natation. But I $ay, that when you $hall <*>
<foot>n</foot>
<p n=>445</p>
mit a Board of Ebony into the Water, you do not put therein a Solid
more grave <I>in $pecie</I> than the Water, but one lighter, for be $ides the
Ebony, there is in the Water a Ma$s of Air, united with the Ebony,
and $uch, and $o light, that of both there re$ults a Compo$ition le$s
grave than the Water: See, therefore, that you remove the Air, and
put the Ebony alone into the Water, for $o you $hall immerge a So-
lid more grave then the Water, and if this $hall not go to the Bottom,
you have well Philo$ophized, and I ill.</P>
<P>Now, $ince we have found the true Cau$e of the Natation of tho$e
Bodies, which otherwi$e as being graver than the Water, would de-
$cend to the bottom, I think, that for the perfect and di$tinct know-
ledge of this bu$ine$s, it would be good to proceed in a way of di$-
covering demon$tratively tho$e particular Accidents that do attend
the$e effects, and,</P>

<P>Let, therefore, for better illu$tration, D F N E be a Ve$$ell,
wherein the water is contained, and $uppo$e a Plate or Board,
who$e thickne$s is comprehended between the Lines I C and
O S, and let it be of Matter exceeding the water in Gravity, $o that
being put upon the water, it dimergeth and aba$eth below the Levell
of the $aid water, leaving the little Banks A I and B C, which are at
the greate$t height they can be, $o that if the Plate I S $hould but
de$cend any little $pace farther, the little Banks or Ramparts would
no longer con$i$t, but expul$ing the Air A I C B, they would dif-
fu$e them$elves over the Superficies I C, and
would $ubmerge the Plate. The height AIBC
is therefore the greate$t profundity that the
<fig>
little <I>B</I>anks of water admit of. Now I $ay,
that from this, and from the proportion in Gra-
vity, that the Matter of the Plate hath to the
water, we may ea$ily $inde of what thickne$s, at mo$t, we may make
the $aid Plates, to the end, they may be able to bear up above water:
for if the Matter of the Plate or <I>B</I>oard I S were, for Example, as
heavy again as the water, a <I>B</I>oard of that Matter $hall be, at the mo$t
of a thickne$s equall to the greate$t height of the <I>B</I>anks, that is, as
thick as A I is high: which we will thus demon$trate. Lot the So-
lid I S be donble in Gravity to the water, and let it be a regular
<foot>Pri$me</foot>
<p n=>446</p>
Pri$me, or Cylinder, to wit, that hath its two flat Superficies, $uper<*>
our and inferiour, alike and equall, and at Right Angles with the <*>
ther laterall Superficies, and let its thickne$s I O be equall to t<*>
greate$t Altitude of the Banks of water: I $ay, that if it be put upo<*>
the water, it will not $ubmerge: for the Altitud <*>
A I being equall to the Altitude I O, the Ma<*>
of the Air A B C I $hall be equall to the Ma$s <*>

the Solid C I O S: and the whole Ma$s A O S <*>
double to the Ma$s I S; And $ince the Ma<*>
of the Air A C, neither encrea$eth nor dim<*>
ni$heth the Gravity of the Ma$s I S, and the Solid I S was $uppo$e<*>
double in Gravity to the water; Therefore as much water as th<*>
Ma$s $ubmerged A O S B, compounded of the Air A I C B, and <*>
the Solid I O S C, weighs ju$t as much as the $ame $ubmerged Ma<*>
A O S B: but when $uch a Ma$s of water, as is the $ubmerged part o<*>

$hall float, as long as its thickne$s be not above twice as much as th<*>

being Se$quialter in Gravity to the water, and the Altitude O <*>
being double to I A, the Solid $ubmerged A O S B, $hall be al$<*>

neither increa$eth nor dimini$heth the pondero$ity of the Solid I <*>
Therefore, as much water in quantity as the $ubmerged Ma$s AOSB <*>
weighs as much as the $aid Ma$s $ubmerged: And, therefore, tha<*>

<P>Let the Solid I S be $uperior in Gravity to the water, and of $uch
thickne$s, that the Altitude of the Rampart A I, be in proporti-
on to the thickne$s of the Solid I O, as the exce$s of the Gravi-
ty of the $aid Solid I S, above the Gravity of a Ma$s of water equall
to the Ma$s I S, is to the Gravity of the Ma$s of water equall to the
<foot>Ma$s</foot>
<p n=>447</p>
Ma$s I S. I $ay, that the Solid I S $hall not
$inke, but being never $o little thicker it $hall
go to the bottom: For being that as A I is
<fig>
to I O, $o is the Exce$s of the Gravity of the
Solid I S, above the Gravity of a Ma$s of water
equall to the Ma$s I S, to the Gravity of the
$aid Ma$s of water: Therefore, compounding, as A O is to O I, $o
$hall the Gravity of the Solid I S, be to the Gravity of a Ma$s of water
equall to the Ma$s I S: And, converting, as I O is to O A, $o $hall the
Gravity of a Ma$s of water equall to the Ma$s I S, be to the Gravity
of the Solid I S: But as I O is to O A, $o is a Ma$s of water I S, to a
Ma$s of water equall to the Ma$s A B S O: and $o is the Gravity of
a Ma$s of water I S, to the Gravity of a Ma$s of water A S: Therefore
as the Gravity of a Ma$s of water, equall to the Ma$s I S, is to the
Gravity of the Solid I S, $o is the $ame Gravity of a Ma$s of water
I S, to the Gravity of a Ma$s of Water A S: Therefore the Gra-
vity of the Solid I S, is equall to the Gravity of a Ma$s of water e-
quall to the Ma$s A S: But the Gravity of the Solid I S, is the $ame
with the Gravity of the Solid A S, compounded of the Solid I S,
and of the Air A B C I. Therefore the whole compounded Solid
A O S B, weighs as much as the water that would be compri$ed in the
place of the $aid Compound A O S B: And, therefore, it $hall make
an <I>Equilibrium</I> and re$t, and that $ame Solid I O S C $hall $inke no
farther. But if its thickne$s I O $hould be increa$ed, it would be ne-
ce$$ary al$o to encrea$e the Altitude of the Rampart A I, to main-
tain the due proportion: But by what hath been $uppo$ed, the Alti-
tude of the Rampart A I, is the greate$t that the Nature of the
Water and Air do admit, without the waters repul$ing the Air ad-
herent to the Superficies of the Solid I C, and po$$e$$ing the $pace
A I C B: Therefore, a Solid of greater thickne$s than I O, and of the
$ame Matter with the Solid I S, $hall not re$t without $ubmerging,
but $hall de$cend to the bottome: which was to be demon$trated.
In con$equence of this that hath been demon$trated, $undry and va-

above declared, for which cau$e it $wims indeed, but yet not if we
never $o little increa$e its thickne$s; I $ay, that retaining its thick-

alwaies $ubmerge, although we $hould multiply the Superficies a
hundred and a hundred times. Now fora$much as that this is a
Cau$e, which being added, we adde al$o the Effect, and being remo-
ved, it is removed; and by augmenting or le$$ening the length or
breadth in any manner, the effect of going, or not going to the bot-
tom, is not added or removed: I conclude, that the greatne$s and
$malne$s of the Superficies hath no influence upon the Natation or
Submer$ion. And that the proportion of the Altitude of the Ram-
parts of Water, to the Altitude of the Solid, being con$tituted in
the manner afore$aid, the greatne$s or $malne$s of the Superficies,
makes not any variation, is manife$t from that which hath been above
demon$trated, and from this, that, <I>The Pri$ms and Cylinders which</I>

to their Conterminall Air, which hath for Ba$e the $aid Superficies of
the Board, and for height the Ramparts of water; $o that alwayes
of that Air, and of the Board, Solids are compounded, that in Gravity
equall a Ma$s of water equall to the Ma$s of the Solids, compounded
of Air, and of the Board: whereupon all the $aid Solids do in the

<P>Let A C and B be two Solids, and let the Ma$s A C be to <*>
Ma$s B, as the Specificall Gravity of the Solid B, is to the Spe
ficall Gravity of the Solid A C: I $ay, the Solids A C and B <*>
equall in ab$olute weight, that is, equally grave, F

if the Ma$s A C be equall to the Ma$s B, then, by <*>
A$$umption, the Specificall Gravity of B, $hall be

quall in Ma$s, and of the $ame Specificall Gravity th<*>
$hall ab$olutely weigh one as much as another. B
if their Ma$$es $hall be unequall, let the Ma$s A C be greater, and in
take the part C, equall to the Ma$s B. And, becau$e the Ma$$es
and C are equall; the Ab$olute weight of B, $hall have the $ame pr<*>

Therefore, the ab$olute weight of B, to the ab$olute weight of C, is

<P>Let the greate$t po$$ible Altitude of the Rampart be the Line D B,
and the Diameter of the Ba$e of the Cone to be made of any Mat-
ter a$$igned B C, at right angles to D B: And as the Specificall Gravity
of the Matter of the Piramide or Cone to be made, is to the Specificall
Gravity of the water, $o let the Altitude of the
<fig>
Rampart D B, be to the third part of the Piramide
or Cone A B C, de$cribed upon the Ba$e, who$e
Diameter is B C: I $ay, that the $aid Cone A B C,
and any other Cone, lower then the $ame, $hall re$t
upon the Surface of the water B C without $inking.
Draw D F parallel to B C, and $uppo$e the Pri$me
or Cylinder E C, which $hall be tripple to the Cone
A B C. And, becau$e the Cylinder D C hath the $ame proportion
to the Cylinder C E, that the Altitude D B, hath to the Altitude B E:
But the Cylinder C E, is to the Cone A B C, as the Altitude E B is to
the third part of the Altitude of the Cone: Therefore, by Equality of
proportion, the Cylinder D C is to the Cone A B C, as D B is to the
third part of the Altitude B E: But as D B is to the third part of B E,
$o is the Specificall Gravity of the Cone A B C, to the Specificall Gra-
vity of the water: Therefore, as the Ma$s of the Solid D C, is to the
Ma$s of the Cone A <I>B</I> C, $o is the Specificall Gravity of the $aid Cone,
to the Specificall Gravity of the water: Therefore, by the precedent
Lemma, the Cone A B C weighs in ab$olute Gravity as much as a

as would preci$ely lie in the place D C, and is equall in weight to the

require a whole Volume ($uch is the multitude and variety of the

<P>Now the quite contrary would happen, if the difficulty of Pene<*>
trating the water, were that which had hindred the de$cent, fo
that the $aid Cone is far apter to pierce and penetrate with its $har<*>
Point, than with its broad and $pacious Ba$e.</P>
<P>And, to demon$trate this, let the Cone be <I>A B C,</I> twice as grav<*>
as the water, and let its height be tripple to the height of the Rampar<*>
<I>D A E C</I>: I $ay, fir$t, that being put lightly into the water with the
<foot>Point</foot>
<p n=>453</p>
Point downwards, it $hall not de$cend to the bot-
tom: for the Aeriall Cylinder contained betwixt
<fig>
the Ramparts <I>D A C E,</I> is equall in Ma$s to the
Cone <I>A B C</I>; $o that the whole Ma$s of the Solid
compounded of the Air <I>D A C E,</I> and of the Cone
<I>A B C,</I> $hall be double to the Cone <I>A C B:</I> And,
becau$e the Cone <I>A B C</I> is $uppo$ed to be of Matter double in Gra-
vity to the water, therefore as much water as the whole Ma$$e
<I>D A B C E,</I> placed beneath the Levell of the water, weighs as much
as the Cone <I>A B C</I>: and, therefore, there $hall be an <I>Equilibrium,</I>
and the Cone <I>A B C</I> $hall de$cend no lower. Now, I $ay farther,
that the $ame Cone placed with the Ba$e downwards, $hall $ink to
the bottom, without any po$$ibility of returning again, by any means
to $wimme.</P>
<P>Let, therefore, the Cone be <I>A B D,</I> double in Gravity to the
water, and let its height be tripple the height
<fig>
of the Rampart of water L B: It is already
manife$t, that it $hall not $tay wholly out of

prehended betwixt the Ramparts <I>L B D P,</I>
equall to the Cone <I>A B D,</I> and the Matter of

<P>Which you may $ee, comparing with the water as well the part
that $hall immerge as the other above water. Let us therefore
of the Cone A B D, $ubmergeth part N T O S, and advance the
Point N S F above water. The Altitude of the Cone F N S, $hall
either be more than half the whole Altitude of the Cone F T O, or
it $hall not be more: if it $hall be more than half, the Cone F N S
$hall be more than half of the Cylinder E N S C: for the Altitude
of the Cone F N S, $hall be more than Se$quialter of the Altitude
of the Cylinder E N S C: And, becau$e the Matter of the Cone is
$uppo$ed to be double in Specificall Gravity to the water, the water
which would be contained within the Rampart E N S C, would be
le$s grave ab$olutely than the Cone F N S; $o that the whole Cone
F N S cannot be $u$tained by the Rampart: But the part immerged
N T O S, by being double in Specificall Gravity to the water, $hall
<foot>tend</foot>
<p n=>454</p>
tend to the bottom: Therefore, the whole <I>C</I>one F T O, as well in
re$pect of the part $ubmerged, as the part above water $hall de-
$cend to the bottom. But if the Altitude of the Point F N S, $hall
be half the Altitude of the whole Cone F T O, the $ame Altitude of
the $aid <I>C</I>one F N S $hall be Se$quialter to the Altitude E N: and,
therefore, E N S C $hall be double to the Cone F N S; and as much
water in Ma$s as the <I>C</I>ylinder E N S C, would weigh as much as the
part of the <I>C</I>one F N S. But, becau$e the other immerged part
N T O S, is double in Gravity to the water, a Ma$s of water equall
to that compounded of the <I>C</I>ylinder E N S C, and of the Solid N T O S,
$hall weigh le$s than the <I>C</I>one F T O, by as much as the weight of
a Ma$s of water equall to the Solid N T O S: Therefore, the <I>C</I>one
$ha l al$o de$cend. Again, becau$e the Solid N T O S, is $eptuple
to the <I>C</I>one F N S, to which the <I>C</I>ylinder E S is double, the propor-
tion of the Solid N T O S, $hall be to the <I>C</I>ylinder E N S C, as $eaven
to two: Therefore, the whole Solid compounded of the <I>C</I>ylinder
E N S C, and of the Solid N T O S, is much le$s than double the
Solid N T O S: Therefore, the $ingle Solid N T O S, is much graver
than a Ma$s of water equall to the Ma$s, compounded of the <I>C</I>y-

<I>and greatne$s $oever, that of their own Nature goe
to the Bottome; But by the help of the Air con-
tained in the Rampart, re$t without $ubmerging.</I></P>
<P>The truth of this Propo$ition is $ufficiently manife$t in all tho$e
Solid Figures, that determine in their uppermo$t part in a plane
Superficies: for making $uch Figures of $ome Matter $pecifi-
cally as grave as the water, putting them into the water, $o that the
whole Ma$s be covered, it is manife$t, that they $hall re$t in all
places, provided, that $uch a Matter equall in weight to the water,
may be exactly adju$ted: and they $hall by con$equence, re$t or
lie even with the Levell of the water, without making any Rampart.
If, therefore, in re$pect of the Matter, $uch Figures are apt to re$t
without $ubmerging, though deprived of the help of the Rampart,
it is manife$t, that they may admit $o much encrea$e of Gravity,
(without encrea$ing their Ma$$es) as is the weight of as much water
as would be contained within the Rampart, that is made about their
upper plane Surface: by the help of which being $u$tained, they
$hall re$t afloat, but being bathed, they $hall de$cend, having been
made graver than the water. In Figures, therefore, that determine
above in a plane, we may cleerly comprehend, that the Rampart
added or removed, may prohibit or permit the de$cent: but in tho$e
Figures that go le$$ening upwards towards the top, $ome Per$ons
may, and that not without much $eeming Rea$on, doubt whether
the $ame may be done, and e$pecially by tho$e which terminate in a
very acute Point, $uch as are your Cones and $mall Piramids. Touch-
ing the$e, therefore, as more dubious than the re$t, I will endeavour
to demon$trate, that they al$o lie under the $ame Accident of going,
or not going to the Bottom, be they of any whatever bigne$s. Let
therefore the Cone be A B D, made of a matter
$pecifically as grave as the water; it is manife$t
<fig>
that being put all under water, it $hall re$t in
all places (alwayes provided, that it $hall weigh
exactly as much as the water, which is almo$t
impo$$ible to effect) and that any $mall weight
being added to it, it $hall $ink to the bottom:
but if it $hall de$cend downwards gently, I $ay,
that it $hall make the Rampart E S T O, and
that there $hall $tay out of the water the point A S T, tripple in
height to the Rampart E S: which is manife$t, for the Matter of the
<foot>Cone</foot>
<p n=>456</p>
Cone weighing equally with the water, the part $ubmerged S B D T,
becomes indifferent to move downwards or upwards; and the Cone
<I>A S T,</I> being equall in Ma$s to the water that would be contained in
the concave of the Rampart <I>E S T O,</I> $hall be al$o equall unto it in
Gravity: and, therefore, there $hall be a perfect <I>Equilibrium,</I> and,
con$equently, a Re$t. Now here ari$eth a doubt, whether the
Cone <I>A B D</I> may be made heavier, in $uch $ort, that when it is put
wholly under water, it goes to the bottom, but yet not in $uch $ort,
as to take from the Rampart the vertue of $u$taining it that it $ink not,
and, the rea$on of the doubt is this: that although at $uch time as
the Cone <I>A B D</I> is $pecifically as grave as the water, the Rampart
<I>E S T O</I> $u$taines it, not only when the point <I>A S T</I> is tripple in
height to the Altitude of the Rampart <I>E S,</I> but al$o when a le$$er
part is above water; [for although in the De$cent of the Cone the
Point <I>A S T</I> by little and little dimini$heth, and $o likewi$e the
Rampart <I>E S T O,</I> yet the Point dimini$heth in
<fig>
greater proportion than the Rampart, in that
it dimini$heth according to all the three Di-
men$ions, but the Rampart according to two
only, the Altitude $till remaining the $ame;
or, if you will, becau$e the Cone <I>S T</I> goes di-
mini$hing, according to the proportion of the
cubes of the Lines that do $ucce$$ively become
the Diameters of the Ba$es of emergent Cones,
and the Ramparts dimini$h according to the proportion of the
Squares of the $ame Lines; whereupon the proportions of the Points
are alwayes Se$quialter of the proportions of the Cylinders, con-
tained within the Rampart; $o that if, for Example, the height of
the emergent Point were double, or equall to the height of the
Rampart, in the$e ca$es, the Cylinder contained within the Ram-
part, would be much greater than the $aid Point, becau$e it would be
either $e$quialter or tripple, by rea$on of which it would perhaps
$erve over and above to fu$tain the whole Cone, $ince the part $ub-
merged would no longer weigh any thing;] yet, neverthele$s, when
any Gravity is added to the whole Ma$s of the Cone, $o that al$o the
part $ubmerged is not without $ome exce$$e of Gravity above the
Gravity of the water, it is not manife$t, whether the Cylinder con-
tained within the Rampart, in the de$cent that the Cone $hall make,
can be reduced to $uch a proportion unto the emergent Point, and to
$uch an exce$$e of Ma$s above the Ma$s of it, as to compen$ate the
exce$$e of the Cones Specificall Gravity above the Gravity of the wa-
ter: and the Scruple ari$eth, becau$e that howbeit in the de$cent
made by the Cone, the emergent Point <I>A S T</I> dimini$heth, whereby
there is al$o a diminution of the exce$s of the Cones Gravity above
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>459</p>
the Gravity of the water, yet the ca$e $tands $o, that the Rampart
doth al$o contract it $elf, and the Cylinder contained in it doth de-
mini$h. Neverthele$s it $hall be demon$trated, how that the Cone
<I>A B D</I> being of any $uppo$ed bigne$$e, and made at the fir$t of a
Matter exactly equall in Gravity to the Water, if there may
be affixed to it $ome Weight, by means of which it may de$cend to
the bottom, when $ubmerged under water, it may al$o by vertue of
the Rampart $tay above without $inking.</P>
<P>Let, therefore, the Cone <I>A B D</I> be of any $uppo$ed greatne$$e,
and alike in $pecificall Gravity to the water. It is manife$t, that
being put lightly into the water, it $hall re$t without de$cending;
and it $hall advance above water, the Point
<fig>
<I>AS T,</I> tripple in height to the height of the
Rampart <I>E S</I>: Now, $uppo$e the Cone <I>A B D</I>
more depre$$ed, $o that it advance above wa-
ter, only the Point <I>A I R,</I> higher by half than
the Point <I>A S T,</I> with the Rampart about it
<I>C I R N.</I> And, becau$e, the Cone <I>A B D</I> is
to the Cone <I>A I R,</I> as the cube of the Line <I>S T</I>
is to the cube of the Line <I>I R,</I> but the Cylin-
der <I>E S T O,</I> is to the Cylinder <I>C I R N,</I> as the Square of <I>S T</I> to
the Square of <I>I R,</I> the Cone <I>A S T</I> $hall be Octuple to the Cone
<I>A I R,</I> and the Cylinder <I>E S T O,</I> quadruple to the Cylinder <I>C I R N</I>:
But the Cone <I>A S T,</I> is equall to the Cylinder E <I>S T O</I>: Therefore,
the Cylinder <I>C I R N,</I> $hall be double to the Cone <I>A I R:</I> and the
water which might be contained in the Rampart <I>C I R N,</I> would be
double in Ma$s and in Weight to the Cone <I>A I R,</I> and, therefore,
would be able to $u$tain the double of the Weight of the Cone <I>AIR</I>:
Therefore, if to the whole Cone <I>A B D,</I> there be added as much
Weight as the Gravity of the Cone <I>A I R,</I> that is to $ay, the eighth
part of the weight of the Cone <I>A S T,</I> it al$o $hall be $u$tained by
the Rampart <I>C I R N,</I> but without that it $hall go to the bottome:
the Cone <I>A B D,</I> being, by the addition of the eighth part of the
weight of the Cone <I>A S T,</I> made $pecifically more grave than the
water. But if the Altitude of the Cone <I>A I R,</I> were two thirds
of the Altitude of the Cone <I>A S T,</I> the Cone <I>A S T</I> would be to the
Cone <I>A I R,</I> as twenty $even to eight; and the Cylinder <I>E S T O,</I> to

<p n=>460</p>
the height of the emergent Point $hall be double to the height of the

in Piramides, although the one or the other $hould be very $harp in

by how much the le$s $harp the Tops $hall be, in which they deter-

<head>THEOREME XIII.</head>
<marg>All Figures $ink

tops.</marg>
<P><I>All Figures, therefore, of whatever greatne$$e, may
go, and not go, to the Bottom, according as their Sumi-
ties or Tops $hall be bathed or not bathed.</I></P>
<P>And this Accident being common to all $orts of Figures, without
exception of $o much as one. Figure hath, therefore, no part
in the production of this Effect, of $ometimes $inking, and $ome-
times again not $inking, but only the being $ometimes conjoyned
to, and $ometimes $eperated from, the $upereminent Air: which
cau$e, in fine, who $o $hall rightly, and, as we $ay, with both his
Eyes, con$ider this bu$ine$s, will find that it is reduced to, yea, that
it really is the $ame with, the true, Naturall and primary cau$e of
Natation or Submer$ion; to wit, the exce$s or deficiency of the
Gravity of the water, in relation to the Gravity of that Solid Mag-
nitude, that is demitted into the water. For like as a Plate of Lead,
as thick as the back of a Knife, which being put into the water by it
$elf alone goes to the bottom, if upon it you fa$ten a piece of Cork
four fingers thick, doth continue afloat, for that now the Solid that
is demitted in the water, is not, as before, more grave than the water,
but le$s, $o the Board of Ebony, of its own nature more grave than
water; and, therefore, de$cending to the bottom, when it is demit-
ted by it $elf alone into the water, if it $hall be put upon the water,
conjoyned with an Expanded vail of Air, that together with the
Ebony doth de$cend, and that it be $uch, as that it doth make with
it a compound le$s grave than $o much water in Ma$s, as equalleth
the Ma$s already $ubmerged and depre$$ed beneath the Levell of the
waters Surface, it $hall not de$cend any farther, but $hall re$t, for
no other than the univer$all and mo$t common cau$e, which is that
Solid Magnitudes, le$s grave <I>in$pecie</I> than the water, go not to the
bottom.</P>
<P>So that if one $hould take a Plate of Lead, as for Example, a finger
thick, and an handfull broad every way, and $hould attempt to make
it $wimme, with putting it lightly on the water, he would lo$e his
Labour, becau$e that if it $hould be depre$$ed an Hairs breadth be-
<foot>yond</foot>
<p n=>461</p>
yond the po$$ible Altitude of the Ramparts of water, it would dive
and $ink; but if whil$t it is going downwards, one $hould make
certain Banks or Ramparts about it, that $hould hinder the do fu$ion
of the water upon the $aid Plate, the which Banks $hould ri$e $o
high, as that they might be able to contain as much water, as $hould
weigh equally with the $aid Plate, it would, without all Que$tion,
de$cend no lower, but would re$t, as being $u$tained by vertue of
the Air contained within the afore$aid Ramparts: and, in $hort,
there would be a Ve$$ell by this means formed with the bottom of
Lead. But if the thinne$s of the Lead $hall be $uch, that a very
$mall height of Rampart would $uffice to contain $o much Air, as might
keep it afloat, it $hall al$o re$t without the Artificiall Banks or Ram-
parts, but yet not without the Air, becau$e the Air by it $elf makes
Banks $ufficient for a $mall height, to re$i$t the Superfu$ion of the
water: $o that that which in this ca$e $wimmes, is as it were a
Ve$$ell filled with Air, by vertue of which it continueth afloat.</P>
<P>I will, in the la$t place, with an other Experimeut, attempt to
remove all difficulties, if $o be there $hould yet be any doubt le$t in
any one, touching the opperation of this ^{*}Continuity of the Air, with

tion of the Re$i$tance in any Weight again$t its being rai$ed in the
Air, and I $uppo$e, that I am to maintain the Affirmative, a$$ert-
ing that a Ma$s of Lead, reduced to the Figure of a Ball, $hall be
rai$ed with le$s force, then if the $ame had been made into a thinne
and broad Plate, becau$e that it in this $pacious Figure, hath a great
quantity of Air to penetrate, and in that other, more compacted and
contracted very little: and to demon$trate the truth of $uch my O-
pinion, I will hang in a $mall thred fi<*>$t the Ball or Bullet, and put
that into the water, tying the thred that upholds it to one end of
the Ballance that I hold in the Air, and to the other end I by degrees
adde $o much Weight, till that at la$t it brings up the Ball of Lead
out of the water: to do which, $uppo$e a Gravity of thirty Ounces
$ufficeth; I afcerwards reduce the $aid Lead into a flat and thinne
Plate, the which I likewi$e put into the water, $u$pended by three
threds, which hold it parallel to the Surface of the water, and put-
ting in the $ame manner, Weights to the other end, till $uch time as
the Place comes to be rai$ed and drawn out of the water: I finde
that thirty $ix ounces will not $uffice to $eperate it from the water,
and rai$e it tho<*>ow the Air: and arguing from this Experiment, I af-
firm, that I have fully demon$trated the truth of my Propo$ition.
He re my Oponents de$ires me to look down, $hewing me a thing
<foot>Nnn 2 which</foot>
<p n=>462</p>
which I had not before ob$erved, to wit, that in the A$cent of the
Plate out of the water, it draws after it another Plate <I>(if I may $o
call it)</I> of water, which before it divides and parts from the inferiour
Surface of the Plate of Lead, is rai$ed above the Levell of the other
water, more than the thickne$s of the back of a Knife: Then he
goeth to repeat the Experiment with the Ball, and makes me $ee,
that it is but a very $mall quantity of water, which cleaves to its
compacted and contracted Figure: and then he $ubjoynes, that its
no wonder, if in $eperating the thinne and broad Plate from the
water, we meet with much greater Re$i$tance, than in $eperating the
Ball, $ince together with the Plate, we are to rai$e a great quantity of
water, which occurreth not in the Ball: He telleth me moreover,
how that our Que$tion is, whether the Re$i$tance of Elevation be
greater in a dilated Plate of Lead, than in a Ball, and not whether
more re$i$teth a Plate of Lead with a great quantity of water, or a
Ball with a very little water: He $heweth me in the clo$e, that the
putting the Plate and the Ball fir$t into the water, to make proofe
thereby of their Re$i$tance in the Air, is be$ides our ca$e, which
treats of Elivating in the Air, and of things placed in the Air, and
not of the Re$i$tance that is made in the Confines of the Air and
water, and by things which are part in Air and part in water: and
la$tly, they make me feel with my hand, that when the thinne Plate
is in the Air, and free from the weight of the water, it is rai$ed with
the very $ame Force that rai$eth the Ball. Seeing, and under$tand-
ing the$e things, I know not what to do, unle$s to grant my $elf con-
vinced, and to thank $uch a Friend, for having made me to $ee that
which I never till then ob$erved: and, being adverti$ed by this $ame
Accident, to tell my Adver$aries, that our Que$tion is, whether a
Board and a Ball of Ebony, equally go to the bottom in water, and
not a Ball of Ebony and a Board of Ebony, joyned with another
flat Body of Air: and, farthermore, that we $peak of $inking, and
not $inking to the bottom, in water, and not of that which happeneth
in the Confines of the water and Air to Bodies that be part in the
Air, and part in the water; nor much le$s do we treat of the greater
or le$$er Force requi$ite in $eperating this or that Body from the Air;
not omitting to tell them, in the la$t place, that the Air doth re$i$t,
and gravitate downwards in the water, ju$t $o much as the water (if
I may $o $peak) gravitates and re$i$ts upwards in the Air, and that the
$ame force is required to $inke a Bladder under water, that is full of
Air, as to rai$e it in the Air, being full of water, removing the con-
$ideration of the weight of that Filme or Skinne, and confidering the
water and the Air only. And it is likewi$e true, that the $ame Force
is required to $ink a Cup or $uch like Ve$$ell under water, whil$t it is
full of Air, as to rai$e it above the Superficies of the water, keeping
<foot>it</foot>
<p n=>463</p>
it with the mouth downwards; whil$t it is full of water, which is
con$trained in the $ame manner to follow the Cup which contains it,
and to ri$e above the other water into the Region of the Air, as the
Air is forced to follow the $ame Ve$$ell under the Surface of the wa-
ter, till that in this ca$e the water, $urmounting the brimme of the
Cup, breaks in, driving thence the Air, and in that ca$e, the $aid
brimme coming out of the water, and arriving to the Confines of the
Air, the water falls down, and the Air $ub-enters to fill the cavity of
the Cup: upon which en$ues, that he no le$s tran$gre$$es the Arti-
cles of the <I>Convention,</I> who produceth a Plate conjoyned with much
Air, to $ee if it de $eend to the bottom in water, then he that makes
proof of the Re$i$tance again$t Elevation in Air with a Plate of Lead,
joyned with a like quantity of water.</P>
<P>I have $aid all that I could at pre$ent think of, to maintain the
<marg><I>Ari$totles</I> opi-
nion touching
the Operation
of Figure ex-
amined.</marg>
A$$ertion I have undertook. It remains, that I examine that which
<I>Ari$totle</I> hath writ of this matter towards the end of his Book <I>De C&aelig;lo</I>;
wherein I $hall note two things: the one that it being true as hath
<marg><I>Ari$tot de C&aelig;lo,</I>
Lib. 4. Cap. 66.</marg>
been demon$trated, that Figure hath nothing to do about the moving
or not moving it $elf upwards or downwards, it $eemes that <I>Aristotle</I>
at his fir$t falling upon this Sp. culation, was of the $ame opinion, as
in my opinion may be collected from the examination of his words.
Tis true, indeed, that in e$$aying afterwards to render a rea$on of
$uch effect, as not having in my conceit hit upon the right, (which
in the $econd place I will examine) it $eems that he is brought to
admit the largene$$e of Figure, to be intere$$ed in this operation.
As to the fir$t particuler, hear the preci$e words of <I>Aristotle.</I></P>
<P><I>Figures are not the Cau$es of moving $imply upwards or downwards,</I>
<marg><I>Ari$totle</I> makes
not Figure the
cau$e of Motion
ab$olutely, but
of $wi$t or $low
motion,</marg>
<I>but of moving more $lowly or $wiftly, and by what means this comes to
pa$s, it is not difficult to $ee.</I></P>
<P>Here fir$t I note, that the terms being four, which fall under the
pre$ent con$ideration, namely, Motion, Re$t, Slowly and Swiftly:
<marg>Lib. 4. Cap. 61
Text. 42.</marg>
And <I>Ari$totle</I> naming Figures as Cau$es of Tardity and Velocity, ex-
cluding them from being the Cau$e of ab$olute and $imple Motion,
it $eems nece$$ary, that he exclude them on the other $ide, from being
the Cau$e of Re$t, $o that his meaning is this. Figures are not the
Cau$es of moving or not moving ab$olutely, but of moving quickly
or $lowly: and, here, if any $hould $ay the mind of <I>Ari$totle</I> is to
exclude Figures from being Cau$es of Motion, but yet not from
being Cau$es of Re$t, $o that the $ence would be to remove from
Figures, there being the Cau$es of moving $imply, but yet not there
being Cau$es of Re$t, I would demand, whether we ought with
<I>Aristotle</I> to under$tand, that all Figures univer$ally, are, in $ome
manner, the cau$es of Re$t in tho$e Bodies, which otherwi$e would
move, or el$e $ome particular Figures only, as for Example, broad
<foot>and</foot>
<p n=>464</p>
and thinne Figures: If all indifferently, then every Body $hall re$t:
becau$e every Body hath $ome Figure, which is fal$e: but if $ome
particular Figures only may be in $ome manner a Cau$e of Re$t, as,
for Example, the broad, then the others would be in $ome manner
the Cau$es of Motion: for if from $eeing $ome Bodies of a contracted
Figure move, which after dilated into Plates re$t, may be inferred,
that the Amplitude of Figure hath a part in the Cau$e of that Re$t;
$o from $eeing $uch like Figures re$t, which afterwards contracted
move, it may with the $ame rea$on be affirmed, that the united and
contracted Figure, hath a part in cau$ing Motion, as the remover of
that which impeded it: The which again is directly oppo$ite to what
<I>Ari$totle</I> $aith, namely, that Figures are not the Cau$es of Motion.
Be$ides, if <I>Ari$totle</I> had admitted and not excluded Figures from be-
ing Cau$es of not moving in $ome Bodies, which moulded into ano-
ther Figure would move, he would have impertinently propounded
in a dubitative manner, in the words immediately following, whence
it is, that the large and thinne Plates of Lead or Iron, re$t upon the
water, $ince the Cau$e was apparent, namely, the Amplitude of
Figure. Let us conclude, therefore, that the meaning of <I>Ari$totle</I>
in this place is to affirm, that Figures are not the Cau$es of ab$olutely
moving or not moving, but only of moving $wif<*>ly or $lowly: which
we ought the rather to believe, in regard it is indeed a me$t true con-
ceipt and opinion. Now the mird of <I>Ari$totle</I> being $uch, and ap-
pearing by con$equence, rather contrary at the fir$t $ight, then fa-
vourable to the a$$ertion of the Oponents, it is nece$$ary, that their
Interpretation be not exactly the $ame with that, but $uch, as being
in part under$tood by $ome of them, and in part by others, was $et
down: and it may ea$ily be indeed $o, being an Interpretation
con$onent to the $ence of the more famous Interpretors, which is,
that the Adverbe <I>Simply</I> or <I>Ab$olutely,</I> put in the Text, orght not to
be joyned to the Verbe to <I>Move,</I> but with the Noun <I>Cau$es</I>: $o that
the purport of <I>Ari$totles</I> words, is to affirm, That Figures are not the
Cau$es ab$olutely of moving or not moving, but yet are Cau$es <I>Se-
cundum quid, viz</I> in $ome $ort; by which means, they are called
Auxiliary and Concomitant Cau$es: and this Propo$ition is received
and a$$erted as true by <I>Signor Buonamico Lib.</I> 5. <I>Cap.</I> 28. where he
thus writes. <I>There are other Cau$es concomitant, by which $ome
things float, and others $ink, among which the Figures of Bodies hath
the fir$t place,</I> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Concerning this Propo$ition, I meet with many doubts and diffi-
culties, for which me thinks the words of <I>Ari$totle</I> are not capable of
$uch a con$truction and $ence, and the difficulties are the$e.</P>
<P>Fir$t in the order and di$po$ure of the words of <I>Ari$totle,</I> the par-
ticle <I>Simpliciter,</I> or if you will <I>ab$olut&eacute;,</I> is conjoyned with the Verb
<foot><I>to</I></foot>
<p n=>465</p>
<I>to move,</I> and $eperated from the Noun <I>Cau$es,</I> the which is a great
pre$umption in my favour, $eeing that the writing and the Text
$aith, Figures are not the Cau$e of moving $imply upwards or
downwards, but of quicker or $lower Motion: and, $aith not,
Figures are not $imply the Cau$es of moving upwards or down-
wards, and when the words of a Text receive, tran$po$ed, a $ence
different from that which they found, taken in the order wherein
the Author di$po$eth them, it is not convenient to inverte them.
And who will affirm that <I>Ari$totle</I> de$iring to write a Propo$ition,
would di$po$e the words in $uch $ort, that they $hould import a
different, nay, a contrary $ence? contrary, I $ay, becau$e under-
$tood as they are written; they $ay, that Figures are not the
Cau$es of Motion, but inverted, they $ay, that Figures are the
Cau$es of Motion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the intent of <I>Aristotle</I> had been to $ay, that Figures
are not $imply the Cau$es of moving upwards or downwards, but
only Cau$es <I>Secundum quid,</I> he would not have adjoyned tho$e
words, <I>but they are Cau$es of the more $wift or $low Motion</I>; yea, the
$ubjoining this would have been not only $uperfluous but fal$e, for
that the whole tenour of the Propo$ition would import thus much.
Figures are not the ab$olute Cau$es of moving upwards or down-
wards, but are the ab$olute Cau$e of the $wift or $low Motion;
which is not true: becau$e the primary Cau$es of greater or le$$er
Velocity, are by <I>Ari$totle</I> in the 4th of his <I>Phy$icks, Text.</I> 71. attri-
buted to the greater or le$$er Gravity of Moveables, compared a-
mong them$elves, and to the greater or le$$er Re$i$tance of the
<I>Medium's,</I> depending on their greater or le$s Cra$$itude: and the$e
are in$erted by <I>Ari$totle</I> as the primary Cau$es; and the$e two only
are in that place nominated: and Figure comes afterwards to be
con$idered, <I>Text.</I> 74. rather as an In$trumentall Cau$e of the force
of the Gravity, the which divides either with the Figure, or with
the <I>Impetus</I>; and, indeed, Figure by it $elf without the force of
Gravity or Levity, would opperate nothing.</P>
<P>Iadde, that if <I>Ari$totle</I> had an opinion that Figure had been in
$ome $ort the Cau$e of moving or not moving, the inqui$ition
which he makes immediately in a doubtfull manner, whence it
comes, that a Plate of Lead flotes, would have been impertinent;
for if but ju$t before he had $aid, that Figure was in a certain $ort
the Cau$e of moving or not moving, he needed not to call in
Que$tion, by what Cau$e the Plate of Lead $wims, and then a$cri-
bing the Cau$e to its Figure; and framing a di$cour$e in this manner.
Figure is a Cau$e <I>Secundum quid</I> of not $inking: but, now, if it be
doubted, for what Cau$e a thin Plate of Lead goes not to the bottom;
it $hall be an$wered, that that proceeds from its Figure: a di$cour$e
<foot>which</foot>
<p n=>466</p>
which would be indecent in a Child, much more in <I>Ari$totle</I>; For
where is the occa$ion of doubting? And who $ees not, that if <I>Ari$totle</I>
had held, that Figure was in $ome $ort a Cau$e of Natation, he
would without the lea$t He$itation have writ; That Figure is in a
certain $ort the Cau$e of Natation, and therefore the Plate of Lead
in re$pect of its large and expatiated Figure $wims; but if we take
the propo$ition of <I>Ari$totle</I> as I $ay, and as it is writte n, and as in-
deed it is true, the en$uing words come in very oppo$itely, as well in
the introduction of $wift and $low, as in the que$tion, which very
pertinently offers it $elf, and would $ay thus much.</P>
<P>Figures are not the Cau$e of moving or not moving $imply up-
wards or downwards, but of moving more quickly or $lowly: But if
it be $o, the Cau$e is doubtfull, whence it proceeds, that a Plate of
Lead or of Iron broad and thin doth $wim, &amp;c. And the occa$ion of
the doubt is obvious, becau$e it $eems at the fir$t glance, that the
Figure is the Cau$e of this Natation, $ince the $ame Lead, or a le$s
quantity, but in another Figure, goes to the bottom, and we have
already affirmed, that the Figure hath no $hare in this effect.</P>
<P>La$tly, if the intent of <I>Ari$totle</I> in this place had been to $ay,
that Figures, although not ab$olutely, are at lea$t in $ome mea$ure
the Cau$e of moving or not moving: I would have it con$idered,
that he names no le$s the Motion upwards, than the other down-
wards: and becau$e in exemplifying it afterwards, he produceth
no other Experiments than of a Plate of Lead, and Board of Ebony,
Matters that of their own Nature go to the bottom, but by vertue
(as our Adver$aries $ay) of their Figure, re$t afloat; it is $it that
they $hould produce $ome other Experiment of tho$e Matters, which
by their Nature $wims, but retained by their Figure re$t at the
bottom. But $ince this is impo$$ible to be done, we conclude, that
<I>Ari$totle</I> in this place, hath not attributed any action to the Figure
of $imply moving or not moving.</P>
<P>But though he hath exqui$itely Philo$ophiz'd, in inve$tigating
the $olution of the doubts he propo$eth, yet will I not undertake
to maintain, rather various difficulties, that pre$ent them$elves
unto me, give me occa$ion of $u$pecting that he hath not entirely
di$plaid unto us, the true Cau$e of the pre$ent Conclu$ion: which
difficulties I will propound one by one, ready to change opinion,
when ever I am $hewed, that the Truth is different from what I $ay;
to the confe$$ion whereof I am much more inclinable than to contra-
diction.</P>
<marg><I>Ari$totle</I> erred
in affirming a
Needle dimitted
long wayes to
$ink.</marg>
<P><I>Ari$totle</I> having propounded the Que$tion, whence it proceeds,
that broad Plates of Iron or Lead, float or $wim; he addeth (as
it were $trengthening the occa$ion of doubting) fora$much as other
things, le$s, and le$s grave, be they round or long, as for in$tance a
<foot>Needle</foot>
<p n=>467</p>
Needle go to the bottom. Now I here doubt, or rather am certain,
that a Needle put lightly upon the water, re$ts afloat, no le$s than the
thin Plates of Iron or Lead. I cannot believe, albeit it hath been
told me, that $ome to defend <I>Ari$totle</I> $hould $ay, that he intends a
Needle demitted not longwayes but endwayes, and with the Point
downwards; neverthele$s, not to leave them $o much as this, though
very weak refuge, and which in my judgement <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf
would refu$e, I $ay it ought to be under$tood, that the Needle mu$t
be demitted, according to the Dimen$ion named by <I>Ari$totle,</I> which
is the length: becau$e, if any other Dimen$ion than that which is
named, might or ought to be taken, I would $ay, that even the Plates
of Iron and Lead, $ink to the bottom, if they be put into the water
edgewayes and not flatwayes. But becau$e <I>Ari$totle</I> $aith, broad
Figures go not to the bottom, it is to be under$tood, being demitted
broadwayes: and, therefore, when he $aith, long Figures as a
Needle, albeit light, re$t not afloat, it ought to be under$tood of
them when demitted longwayes.</P>
<P><I>Morcover, to $ay that</I> Ari$totle <I>is to be under$tood of the Needle de-
mitted with the Point downwards, is to father upon him a great imper-
tinency; for in this place he $aith, that little Particles of Lead or Iron,
if they be round or long as a Needle, do $ink to the bottome; $o that by
his Opinion, a Particle or $mall Grain of Iron cannot $wim: and if he
thus believed, what a great folly would it be to $ubjoyn, that neither
would a Needle demitted endwayes $wim? And what other is $uch a
Needle, but many $uch like Graines accumulated one upon another? It
was too unworthy of $uch a man to $ay, that one $ingle Grain of Iron could
not $wim, and that neither can it $wim, though you put a hundred more
upon it.</I></P>
<P>La$tly, either <I>Ari$totle</I> believed, that a Needle demitted long-
wayes upon the water, would $wim, or he believed that it would
not $wim: If he believed it would not $wim, he might well $peak
as indeed he did; but if he believed and knew that it would $loat,
why, together with the dubious Problem of the Natation of broad
Figure, though of ponderous Matter, hath he not al$o introduced
the Que$tion; whence it proceeds, that even long and $lender Fi-
gures, howbeit of Iron or Lead do $wim? And the rather, for that
the occa$ion of doubting $eems greater in long and narrow Figures,
than in broad and thin, as from <I>Aristotles</I> not having doubted of it,
is manife$ted.</P>
<P>No le$$er an inconvenience would they fa$ten upon <I>Ari$totle,</I> who
in his defence $hould $ay, that he means a Needle pretty thick, and
not a $mall one; for take it for granted to be intended of a $mall one<*>
<foot>Ooo and</foot>
<p n=>468</p>
and it $hall $uffice to reply, that he believed that it would $wim;
and I will again charge him with having avoided a more wonderfull
and intricate Probleme, and introduced the more facile and le$s
wonderfull.</P>
<P>We $ay freely therefore; that <I>Ari$totle</I> did hold, that only the
broad Figure did $wim, but the long and $lender, $uch as a Needle,
not. The which neverthele$s is fal$e, as it is al$o fal$e in round
Bodies: becau$e, as from what hath been predemon$trated, may be ga-
thered, little Balls of Lead and Iron, do in like manner $wim.</P>

different from the truth, and it is, That $ome things, by rea$on of
their littlene$s fly in the Air, as the $mall du$t of the Earth, and the
thin leaves of beaten Gold: but in my Opinion, Experience $hews
us, that that happens not only in the Air, but al$o in the water, in
which do de$cend, even tho$e Particles or Atomes of Earth, that
di$tur be it, who$e minuity is $uch, that they are not de$ervable, $ave
only when they are many hundreds together. Therefore, the du$t
of the Earth, and beaten Gold, do not any way $u$tain them$elves
in the Air, but de$cend downwards, and only fly to and again in
the $ame, when $trong Windes rai$e them, or other agitations of the
Air commove them: and this al$o happens in the commotion of the
water, which rai$eth its Sand from the bottom, and makes it muddy.
But <I>Ari$totle</I> cannot mean this impediment of the commotion, of
which he makes no mention, nor names other than the lightne$s of
$uch Minuti&aelig; or Atomes, and the Re$i$tance of the Cra$$itudes of the
Water and Air, by which we $ee, that he $peakes of a calme, and
not di$turbed and agitated Air: but in that ca$e, neither Gold nor
Earth, be they never $o $mall, are $u$tained, but $peedily de$cend.</P>

<P>He pa$$eth next to confute <I>Democritus,</I> which, by his Te$timony

which are very broad, and that the narrow de$cend to the bottom,

<P>I $ay, <I>Ari$totle</I> confutes this po$ition, $aying, that that $hould

much more occurre in the Air, as the $ame <I>Democritus</I> in$tances a-
gain$t him$elf, but after he had moved the objection, he $lightly re-
$olves it, with $aying, that tho$e Corpu$cles which a$cend in the Air,
make not their <I>Impetus</I> conjunctly. Here I will not $ay, that the
<marg><I>Ari$totles</I> con-
futation of <I>De-
mocritus</I> refuted
by the Author.</marg>
rea$on alledged by <I>Democritus</I> is true, but I will only $ay, it $eems
in my judgement, that it is not wholly confuted by <I>Ari$totle,</I> whil$t he
$aith, that were it true, that the calid a$cending Atomes, $hould
$u$tain Bodies grave, but very broad, it would much more be done
in the Air, than in Water, for that haply in the Opinion of <I>Ari$totle,</I>
<foot>the</foot>
<p n=>469</p>
the $aid calid Atomes a$cend with much greater Force and Velocity
through the Air, than through the water. And if this be $o, as I veri-
ly believe it is, the Objection of <I>Ari$totle</I> in my judgement $eems to
give occa$ion of $u$pecting, that he may po$$ibly be deceived in more
than one particular: Fir$t, becau$e tho$e calid Atomes, (whether
they be Fiery Corpu$cles, or whether they be Exhalations, or in
$hort, whatever other matter they be, that a$cends upwards through
the Air) cannot be believed to mount fa$ter through Air, than
through water: but rather on the contrary, they peradventure move
more impetuou$ly through the water, than through the Air, as hath
been in part demon$trated above. And here I cannot finde the rea-
$on, why <I>Ari$totle</I> $eeing, that the de$eending Motion of the $ame
Moveable, is more $wift in Air, than in water, hath not adverti$ed
us, that from the contrary Motion, the contrary $hould nece$$arily
follow; to wit, that it is more $wift in the water, than in the Air: for
$ince that the Moveable which de$cendeth, moves $wifter through
the Air, than through the water, if we $hould $uppo$e its Gravity
gradually to dimini$h, it would fir$t become $uch, that de$cending
$wiftly through the Air, it would de$cend but $lowly through the
water: and then again, it might be $uch, that de$cending in the
Air, it $hould a$cend in the water: and being made yet le$s grave,
it $hall a$cend $wiftly through the water, and yet de$cend likewi$e
through the Air: and in $hort, before it can begin to a$cend, though
but $lowly through the Air, it $hall a$cend $wiftly through the water:
how then is it true, that a$cending Moveables move $wifter through
the Air, than through the water?</P>
<P>That which hath made <I>Ari$totle</I> believe, the Motion of A$cent to be
$wifter in Air, than in water, was fir$t, the having referred the
Cau$es of $low and quick, as well in the Motion of A$cent, as of
De$cent, only to the diver$ity of the Figures of the Moveable, and to
the more or le$s Re$i$tance of the greater or le$$er Cra$$itude, or Ra-
rity of the <I>Medium</I>; not regarding the compari$on of the Exce$$es
of the Gravities of the Moveables, and of the <I>Mediums</I>: the which
notwith$tanding, is the mo$t principal point in this affair: for if the
augmentation and diminution of the Tardity or Velocity, $hould
have only re$pect to the Den$ity or Rarity of the <I>Medium,</I> every Body
that de$cends in Air, would de$cend in water: becau$e whatever
difference is found between the Cra$$itude of the water, and that of
the Air, may well be found between the Velocity of the $ame Move-
able in the Air, and $ome other Velocity: and this $hould be its
proper Velocity in the water, which is ab$olutely fal$e. The other
occa$ion is, that he did believe, that like as there is a po$itive and in-
trin$ecall Quality, whereby Elementary Bodies have a propen$ion
of moving towards the Centre of the Earth, $o there is another like-
<foot>Ooo 2 wi$e</foot>
<p n=>470</p>
wi$e intrin$ecall, whereby $ome of tho$e Bodies have an <I>Impetus</I> of
<marg>Lib. 4. Cap. 5.</marg>
flying the Centre, and moving upwards: by Vertue of which in-
trin$e call Principle, called by him Levity, the Moveables which have
that $ame Motion more ea$ily penetrate the more $ubtle <I>Medium,</I>
than the more den$e: but $uch a Propo$ition appears likewi$e un-
certain, as I have above hinted in part, and as with Rea$ons and
Experiments, I could demon$trate, did not the pre$ent Argument im-
portune me, or could I di$patch it in few words.</P>
<P>The Objection therefore of <I>Ari$totle</I> again$t <I>Democritus,</I> whil$t
he $aith, that if the Fiery a$cending Atomes $hould $u$tain Bodies
grave, but of a di$tended Figure, it would be more ob$ervable in
the Air than in the water, becau$e $uch Corpu$cles move $wifter in
that, than in this, is not good; yea the contrary would evene, for
that they a$cend more $lowly through the Air: and, be$ides their
moving $lowly, they a$cend, not united together, as in the water,
but di$continue, and, as we $ay, $catter: And, therefore, as
<I>Democritus</I> well replyes, re$olving the in$tance they make not their
pu$h or <I>Impetus</I> conjunctly.</P>
<P><I>Ari$totle,</I> in the $econd place, deceives him$elf, whil$t he will
have the $aid grave Bodies to be more ea$ily $u$tained by the $aid
Fiery a$cending Atomes in the Air than in the Water: not ob$erv-
ing, that the $aid Bodies are much more grave in that, than in this,
and that $uch a Body weighs ten pounds in the Air, which will not
in the water weigh 1/2 an ounce; how can it then be more ea$ily
$u$tained in the Air, than in the Water?</P>
<P>Let us conclude, therefore, that <I>Democritus</I> hath in this particular
better Philo$ophated than <I>Ari$totle.</I> But yet will not I affirm, that <I>De-</I>
<marg><I>Democritus</I> con-
futed by the
Authour.</marg>
<I>mocritus</I> hath rea$on'd rightly, but I rather $ay, that there is a ma-
nife$t Experiment that overthrows his Rea$on, and this it is, That
if it were true, that calid a$cending Atomes $hould uphold a Body,
that if they did not hinder, would go to the bottom, it would follow,
that we may find a Matter very little $uperiour in Gravity to the
water, the which being reduced into a Ball, or other contracted
Figure, $hould go to the bottom, as encountring but few Fiery A-
tomes; and which being di$tended afterwards into a dilated and
thin Plate, $hould come to be thru$t upwards by the impul$ion of a
great Multitude of tho$e Corpu$cles, and at la$t carried to the very
Surface of the water: which wee $ee not to happen; Experience
$hewing us, that a Body <I>v. gra.</I> of a Sphericall Figure, which very
hardly, and with very great lea$ure goeth to the bottom, will re$t
there, and will al$o de$cend thither, being reduced into what$oever
other di$tended Figure. We mu$t needs $ay then, either that in the
water, there are no $uch a$cending Fiery Atoms, or if that $uch there
be, that they are not able to rai$e and lift up any Plate of a Matter,
<foot>that</foot>
<p n=>471</p>
that without them would go to the bottom: Of which two Pofitions,
I e$teem the $econd to be true, under$tanding it of water, con$tituted
in its naturall Coldne$s. But if we take a Ve$$el of Gla$s, or Bra$s,
or any other hard matter, full of cold water, within which is put a
Solid of a flat or concave Figure, but that in Gravity exceeds the
water $o little, that it goes $lowly to the bottom; I $ay, that putting
$ome burning Coals under the $aid Ve$$el, as $oon as the new Fiery
Atomes $hall have penetrated the $ub$tance of the Ve$$el, they $hall
without doubt, a$cend through that of the water, and thru$ting a-
gain$t the fore$aid Solid, they $hall drive it to the Superficies, and
there detain it, as long as the incur$ions of the $aid Corpu$cles $hall
la$t, which cea$ing after the removall of the Fire, the Solid being a-
bandoned by its $upporters, $hall return to the bottom.</P>
<P>But <I>Democritus</I> notes, that this Caufe only takes place when we
treat of rai$ing and $u$taining of Plates of Matters, but very little
heavier than the water, or extreamly thin: but in Matters very
grave, and of $ome thickne$s, as Plates of Lead or other Mettal, that
$ame Effect wholly cea$eth: In Te$timony of which, let's ob$erve
that $uch Plates, being rai$ed by the Fiery Atomes, a$cend through
all the depth of the water, and $top at the Confines of the Air, $till
$taying under water: but the Plates of the Opponents $tay not, but
only when they have their upper Superficies dry, nor is there any
means to be u$ed, that when they are within the water, they may
not $ink to the bottom. The cau$e, therefore, of the Supernatation
of the things of which <I>Democritus</I> $peaks is one, and that of the Super-
natation of the things of which we $peak is another. But, returning
<marg><I>Ari$totle</I> $hews
his de$ire of
finding <I>Demo-
critus</I> in an Er-
ror, to exceed
that of di$co-
veting Truth.</marg>
to <I>Ari$totle,</I> methinks that he hath more weakly confuted <I>Democritus,</I>
than <I>Democritus</I> him$elf hath done: For <I>Ari$totle</I> having propounded
the Objection which he maketh again$t him, and oppo$ed him with
$aying, that if the calid a$cendent Corpu$cles were tho$e that rai$ed
the thin Plate, much more then would $uch a Solid be rai$ed and
born upwards through the Air, it $heweth that the de$ire in <I>Ari$totle</I>
to detect <I>Democritus,</I> was predominate over the exqui$itene$s of Solid
Philo$ophizing: which de$ire of his he hath di$covered in other oc-
ca$ions, and that we may not digre$s too far from this place, in the
Text precedent to this Chapter which we have in hand; where he
<marg>Cap. 5. Text 41.</marg>
attempts to confute the $ame <I>Democritus,</I> for that he, not content-
ing him$elf with names only, had e$$ayed more particularly to de-
clare what things Gravity and Levity were; that is, the Cau$es of
de$cending and a$cending, (and had introduced Repletion and Va-
cuity) a$cribing this to Fire, by which it moves upwards, and that to
the Earth, by which it de$cends; afterwards attributing to the
Air more of Fire, and to the water more of Earth. But <I>Ari$totle</I>
de$iring a po$itive Cau$e, even of a$cending Motion, and not as <I>Plato,</I>
<foot>or</foot>
<p n=>472</p>
or the$e others, a $imple negation, or privation, $uch as Vacuity
<marg>Id. ibid.</marg>
would be in reference to Repletion, argueth again$t <I>Democritus</I> and
$aith: If it be true, as you $uppo$e, then there $hall be a great Ma$s
of water, which $hall have more of Fire, than a $mall Ma$s of Air,
and a great Ma$s of Air, which $hall have more of Earth than a lit-
tle Ma$s of water, whereby it would en$ue, that a great Ma$s of Air,
$hould come more $wiftly downwards, than a little quantity of
water: But that is never in any ca$e $oever: Therefore <I>Democritus</I>
di$cour$eth erroneou$ly.</P>
<P>But in my opinion, the Doctrine of <I>Democritus,</I> is not by this alle-
gation overthrown, but if I erre not, the manner of <I>Ari$totle</I> deduction
either concludes not, or if it do conclude any thing, it may with e-
quall force be re$tored again$t him$elf. <I>Democritus</I> will grant to
<I>Ari$totle,</I> that there may be a great Ma$s of Air taken, which con-
tains more Earth, than a $mall quantity of water, but yet will deny,
that $uch a Ma$s of Air, $hall go fa$ter downwards than a little water,
and that for many rea$ons. Fir$t, becau$e if the greater quantity
of Earth, contained in the great Ma$s of Air, ought to cau$e a greater
Velocity than a le$s quantity of Earth, contained in a little quantity
of water, it would be nece$$ary, fir$t, that it were true, that a
greater Ma$s of pure Earth, $hould move more $wiftly than a le$s:
But this is fal$e, though <I>Ari$totle</I> in many places affirms it to be true:
becau$e not the greater ab$olute, but the greater $pecificall Gravity,
<marg>The greater
Specificall, not
the greater ab-
$olute Gravity,
is the Cau$e of
Velocity.</marg>
is the cau$e of greater Velocity: nor doth a Ball of Wood, weigh-
ing ten pounds, de$cend more $wiftly than one weighing ten Ounces,
and that is of the $ame Matter: but indeed a Bullet of Lead of four
Ounces, de$cendeth more $wiftly than a Ball of Wood of twenty
Pounds: becau$e the Lead is more grave <I>in $pecie</I> than the Wood.
Therefore, its not nece$$ary, that a great Ma$s of Air, by rea$on of
the much Earth contained in it, do de$cend more $wiftly than a little
<marg>Any Ma$s of
water $hal move
more $wiftly,
than any of Air,
and why.</marg>
Ma$s of water, but on the contrary, any what$oever Ma$s of water,
$hall move more $wiftly than any other of Air, by rea$on the partici-
pation of the terrene parts <I>in $pecie</I> is greater in the water, than in the
Air. Let us note, in the $econd place, how that in multiplying the
Ma$s of the Air, we not only multiply that which is therein of terrene,
but its Fire al$o: whence the Cau$e of a$cending, no le$s encrea$eth,
by vertue of the Fire, than that of de$cending on the account of its
multiplied Earth. It was requi$ite in increa$ing the greatne$s of the
Air, to multiply that which it hath of terrene only, leaving its Fire
in its fir$t $tate, for then the terrene parts of the augmented Air,
overcoming the terrene parts of the $mall quantity of water, it might
with more probability have been pretended, that the great quanti-
ty of Air, ought to de$cend with a greater <I>Impetus,</I> than the little
quantity of water.</P>
<foot>Therefore,</foot>
<p n=>467</p>
<P>Therefore, the Fallacy lyes more in the Di$cour$e of <I>Ari$totle,</I> than
in that of <I>Democritus,</I> who with $everall other Rea$ons might oppo$e
<I>Ari$totle,</I> and alledge; If it be true, that the extreame Elements be
one $imply grave, and the other $imply light, and that the mean
Elements participate of the one, and of the other Nature; but the
Air more of Levity, and the water more of Gravity, then there $hall
be a great Ma$s of Air, who$e Gravity $hall exceed the Gravity of a
little quantity of water; and therefore $uch a Ma$s of Air $hall de-
$cend more $wiftly than that little water: But that is never $een to
occurr: Therefore its not true, that the mean Elements do partici-
pate of the one, and the other quality. This argument is fallacious,
no le$s than the other again$t <I>Democritus.</I></P>
<P>La$tly, <I>Aristotle</I> having $aid, that if the Po$ition of <I>Democritus</I>
were true, it would follow, that a great Ma$s of Air $hould move
more $wiftly than a $mall Ma$s of water, and afterwards $ubjoyned,
that that is never $een in any Ca$e: methinks others may become de-
$irous to know of him in what place this $hould evene, which he de-
duceth again$t <I>Democritus,</I> and what Experiment teacheth us, that
it never falls out $o. To $uppo$e to $ee it in the Element of water,
or in that of the Air is vain, becau$e neither doth water through
water, nor Air through Air move, nor would they ever by any
whatever participation others a$$ign them, of Earth or of Fire: the
Earth, in that it is not a Body fluid, and yielding to the mobility of
other Bodies, is a mo$t improper place and <I>Medium</I> for $uch an Ex-
periment: <I>Vacuum,</I> according to the $ame <I>Ari$totle</I> him$elf, there
is none, and were there, nothing would move in it: there remaine
the Region of Fire, but being $o far di$tant from us, what Experi-
ment can a$$ure us, or hath a$$ertained <I>Ari$totle</I> in $uch $ort, that he
$hould as of a thing mo$t obvious to $ence, affirm what he produ-
ceth in confutation of <I>Democritus,</I> to wit, that a great Ma$s of Air,
is moved no $wifter than a little one of water? But I will dwell no
longer upon this matter, whereon I have $poke $ufficiently: but
leaving <I>Democritus,</I> I return to the Text of <I>Ari$totle,</I> wherein he
goes about to render the true rea$on, how it comes to pa$s, that the
thin Plates of Iron or Lead do $wim on the water; and, moreover,
that Gold it $elf being beaten into thin Leaves, not only $wims in
water, but flyeth too and again in the Air. He $uppo$eth that of
<marg><I>De Cal<*></I> l. 4. c.
6. t. 44.</marg>
Continualls, $ome are ea$ily divi$ible, others not: and that of the
ea$ily divi$ible, $ome are more $o, and $ome le$s: and the$e he
affirms we $hould e$teem the Cau$es. He addes that that is ea$ily
divi$ible, which is well terminated, and the more the more divi$ible,
and that the Air is more $o, than the water, and the water than the
Earth. And, la$tly, he $uppo$eth that in each kind, the le$$e quan-
tity is ea$lyer divided and broken than the greater.</P>
<foot>Here</foot>
<p n=>474</p>
<P>Here I note, that the Conclu$ions of <I>Ari$totle</I> in generall are all
true, but methinks, that he applyeth them to particulars, in which
they have no place, as indeed they have in others, as for Example,
Wax is more ea$ily divi$ible than Lead, and Lead than Silver, in-
a$much as Wax receives all the terms more ea$iler than Lead, and
Lead than Silver. Its true, moreover, that a little quantity of Sil-
ver is ea$lier divided than a great Ma$s: and all the$e Propo$itions
are true, becau$e true it is, that in Silver, Lead and Wax, there
is $imply a Re$i$tance again$t Divi$ion, and where there is the ab$o-
lute, there is al$o the re$pective. But if as well in water as in Air,
there be no Renitence again$t $imple Divi$ion, how can we $ay, that
the water is ea$lier divided than the Air? We know not how to ex-
tricate our $elves from the Equivocation: whereupon I return to
an$wer, that Re$i$tance of ab$olute Divi$ion is one thing, and Re-
$i$tance of Divi$ion made with $uch and $uch Velocity is another.
But to produce Re$t, and to abate the Motion, the Re$i$tance of
ab$olute Divi$ion is nece$$ary; and the Re$i$tance of $peedy Di-
vi$ion, cau$eth not Re$t, but $lowne$s of Motion. But that as well
in the Air, as in water, there is no Re$i$tance of $imple Divi$ion, is
manife$t, for that there is not found any Solid Body which divides
not the Air, and al$o the water: and that beaten Gold, or $mall
du$t, are not able to $uperate the Re$i$tance of the Air, is contrary
to that which Experience $hews us, for we $ee Gold and Du$t to go
waving to and again in the Air, and at la$t to de$cend down-
wards, and to do the $ame in the water, if it be put therein, and $e-
parated from the Air. And, becau$e, as I $ay, neither the water,
nor the Air do re$i$t $imple Divi$ion, it cannot be $aid, that the water
re$i$ts more than the Air. Nor let any object unto me, the Exam-
ple of mo$t light Bodies, as a Feather, or a little of the pith of El-
der, or water-reed that divides the Air and not the water, and from
this infer, that the Ait is ea$lier divi$ible than the water; for I $ay
unto them, that if they do well ob$erve, they $hall $ee the $ame

Body likewi$e divide the Continuity of the water, and $ubmerge in
part, and in $uch a part, as that $o much water in Ma$s would weigh
as much as the whole Solid. And if they $hal yet per$i$t in their doubt,
that $uch a Solid $inks not through inability to divide the water, I will
return them this reply, that if they put it under water, and then let it
go, they $hall $ee it divide the water, and pre$ently a$cend with no le$s
celerity, than that with which it divided the Air in de$cending: $o that
to $ay that this Solid a$cends in the Air, but that coming to the water,
it cea$eth its Motion, and therefore the water is more difficult to be
divided, concludes nothing: for I, on the contrary, will propo$e them
a piece of Wood, or of Wax, which ri$eth from the bottom of the
water, and ea$ily divides its Re$i$tance, which afterwards being arri-
<foot>ved</foot>
<p n=>475</p>
ved at the Air, $tayeth there, and hardly toucheth it; whence I may
aswell $ay, that the water is more ea$ier divided than the Air</P>
<P>I will not on this occa$ion forbear to give warning of another fal-
lacy of the$e per$ons, who attribute the rea$on of $inking or $wimming
to the greater or le$$e Re$i$tance of the Cra$$itude of the water again$t
Divi$ion, making u$e of the example of an Egg, which in $weet water
goeth to the bottom, but in $alt water $wims; and alledging for the
cau$e thereof, the faint Re$i$tance of fre$h water again$t Divi$ion, and
the $trong Re$i$tance of $alt water But if I mi$take not, from the $ame
Experiment, we may aswell deduce the quite contrary; namely, that
the fre$h water is more den$e, and the $alt more tenuous and $ubtle,
$ince an Egg from the bottom of $alt water $peedily a$cends to the
top, and divides its Re$i$tance, which it cannot do in the fre$h, in who$e
bottom it $tays, being unable to ri$e upwards. Into $uch like perplex-
ities, do fal$e Principles Lead men: but he that rightly Philo$ophating,
$hall acknowledge the exce$$es of the Gravities of the Moveables and
of the Mediums, to be the Cau$es of tho$e effects, will $ay, that the
Egg $inks to the bottom in fre$h water, for that it is more grave than
it, and $wimeth in the $alt, for that its le$s grave than it: and $hall
without any ab$urdity, very $olidly e$tabli$h his Conclu$ions.</P>
<P>Therefore the rea$on totally cea$eth, that <I>Ari$totle</I> $ubjoyns in the
<marg>Text 45.</marg>
Text $aying; The things, therefore, which have great breadth remain
above, becau$e they comprehend much, and that which is greater,
is not ea$ily divided. Such di$cour$ing cea$eth, I $ay, becau$e its not
true, that there is in water or in Air any Re$i$tance of Divi$ion; be-
$ides that the Plate of Lead when it $tays, hath already divided and
penetrated the Cra$$itude of the water, and profounded it $elf ten or
twelve times more than its own thickne$s: be$ides that $uch Re$i$tance
of Divi$ion, were it $uppo$ed to be in the water, could not rationally
be affirmed to be more in its $uperiour parts than in the middle, and
lower: but if there were any difference, the inferiour $hould be the
more den$e, $o that the Plate would be no le$s unable to penetrate
the lower, than the $uperiour parts of the water; neverthele$s we $ee
that no $ooner do we wet the $uperious Superficies of the Board or
thin Piece of Wood, but it precipitatly, and without any reten$ion,
de$cends to the bottom.</P>
<P>I believe not after all this, that any (thinking perhaps thereby to
defend <I>Aristotle</I>) will $ay, that it being true, that the much water re-
$i$ts more than the little, the $aid Board being put lower de$cendeth,
becau$e there remaineth a le$s Ma$s of water to be divided by it: be-
cau$e if after the having $een the $ame Board $wim in four Inches of
water, and al$o after that in the $ame to $ink, he $hall try the $ame
Experiment upon a profundity of ten or twenty fathom water, he
$hall $ee the very $elf $ame effect. And here I will take occa$ion to

or a thou$and fathom, $wims with $ubmerging only $ix fathom of its
own height, [<I>or in the Sea dialect, that draws $ix fathom water</I>] $hall
$wim in the $ame manner in water, that hath but $ix fathom and half
<marg>A Ship that

thome and 1/2 an
Inch of depth.</marg>
an Inch of depth. Nor do I on the other $ide, think that it can be
$aid, that the $uperiour parts of the water are the more den$e, al-
though a mo$t grave Authour hath e$teemed the $uperiour water in
the Sea to be $o, grounding his opinion upon its being more $alt, than
that at the bottom: but I doubt the Experiment, whether hitherto
in taking the water from the bottom, the Ob$ervatour did not light
upon $ome $pring of fre$h water there $pouting up: but we plainly
$ee on the contrary, the fre$h Waters of Rivers to dilate them$elves
for $ome miles beyond their place of meeting with the $alt water of
the Sea, without de$cending in it, or mixing with it, unle$s by the
intervention of $ome commotion or turbulency of the Windes.</P>
<P>But returning to <I>Aristotle,</I> I $ay, that the breadth of Figure hath
nothing to do in this bu$ine$s more or le$s, becau$e the $aid Plate of
<marg>Thickne$s not
breadth of Fi-
gure to be re-
$pected in Na-
tation.</marg>
Lead, or other Matter, cut into long Slices, $wim neither more nor
le$s; and the $ame $hall the Slices do, being cut anew into little
pieces, becau$e its not the breadth but the thickne$s that operates in
this bu$ine$s. I $ay farther, that in ca$e it were really true, that the
<marg>Were Reni-
tence the cau$e
of Natation,
breadth of Fi-
gure would
hinder the
$wiming of Bo-
dies.</marg>
Renitence to Divi$ion were the proper Cau$e of $wimming, the Fi-
gures more narrow and $hort, would much better $wim than the more
$pacious and broad, $o that augmenting the breadth of the Figure,
the facility of $upernatation will be demini$hed, and decrea$ing, that
this will encrea$e.</P>
<P>And for declaration of what I $ay, con$ider that when a thin Plate
of Lead de$cends, dividing the water, the Divi$ion and di$continu-
ation is made between the parts of the water, invironing the perime-
ter or Circumference of the $aid Plate, and according to the big-
ne$s greater or le$$er of that circuit, it hath to divide a greater or
le$$er quantity of water, $o that if the circuit, $uppo$e of a Board,
be ten Feet in $inking it flatways, it is to make the $eperation and
divi$ion, and to $o $peak, an inci$$ion upon ten Feet of water; and
likewi$e a le$$er Board that is four Feet in Perimeter, mu$t make an
ince$$ion of four Feet. This granted, he that hath any knowledge
in Geometry, will comprehend, not only that a Board $awed in many
long thin pieces, will much better float than when it was entire, but
that all Figures, the more $hort and narrow they be, $hall $o much the
better $wim. Let the Board ABCD be, for Example, eight
Palmes long, and five broad, its circuit $hall be twenty $ix Palmes;
and $o many mu$t the ince$$ion be, which it $hall make in the water to
de$cend therein: but if we do $aw ir, as $uppo$e into eight little
<foot>pieces</foot>
<p n=>469</p>
pieces, according to the Lines E F, G H, <I>&amp;c.</I> making $even Segments,
we mu$t adde to the twenty $ix Palmes of the circuit of the whole
Board, $eventy others; whereupon the eight little pieces $o cut and
$eperated, have to cut ninty $ix Palmes of water. And, if moreover,
we cur each of the $aid pieces into five parts, re-
<fig>
ducing them into Squares, to the circuit of ninty
$ix Palmes, with four cuts of eight Palmes apiece;
we $hall adde al$o $ixty four Palmes, whereupon
the $aid Squares to de$cend in the water, mu$t
divide one hundred and $ixty Palmes of water,
but the Re$i$tance is much greater than that of
twenty $ix; therefore to the le$$er Superficies,
we $hall reduce them, $o much the more ea$ily
will they float: and the $ame will happen in all
other Figures, who$e Superficies are $imular among$t them$elves, but
different in bigne$s: becau$e the $aid Superficies, being either demini-
$hed or encrea$ed, always dimini$h or encrea$e their Perimeters in
$ubduple proportion; to wit, the Re$i$tance that they find in pene-
trating the water; therefore the little pieces gradually $wim, with more
and more facility as their breadth is le$$ened.</P>
<P><I>This is manife$t; for keeping $till the $ame height of the Solid, with
the $ame proportion as the Ba$e encrea$eth or demini$heth, doth the $aid
Solid al$o encrea$e or dimini$h; whereupon the Solid more dimini$hing
than the Circuit, the Cau$e of Submer$ion more dimini$heth than the Cau$e
of Natation: And on the contrary, the Solid more encrea$ing than the
Circuit, the Cau$e of Submer$ion encrea$eth more, that of Natation
le$s.</I></P>
<P>And this may all be dedueed out of the Doctrine of <I>Ari$totle</I> a-
gain$t his own Doctrine.</P>
<P>La$tly, to that which we read in the latter part of the Text, that
<marg>Lib. 4. c. 6.
Text 45.</marg>
is to $ay, that we mu$t compare the Gravity of the Moveable with
the Re$i$tance of the Medium again$t Divi$ion, becau$e if the force of
the Gravity exceed the Re$i$tance of the <I>Medium,</I> the Moveable will
de$cend, if not it will float. I need not make any other an$wer,
but that which hath been already delivered; namely, that its not
the Re$i$tance of ab$olute Divi$ion, (which neither is in Water nor
Air) but the Gravity of the <I>Medium</I> that mu$t be compared with the
Gravity of the Moveables; and if that of the <I>Medium</I> be greater, the
Moveable $hall not de$cend, nor $o much as make a totall Submer$ion,
but a partiall only: becau$e in the place which it would occupy in
the water, there mu$t not remain a Body that weighs le$s than a like
quantity of water: but if the Moveable be more grave, it $hall de$-
cend to the bottom, and po$$e$s a place where it is more conformable
<foot>Ppp 2 for</foot>
<pb>
for it to remain, than another Body that is le$s grave. And this
is the only true proper and ab$olute Cau$e of Natation and Sub-
mer$ion, $o that nothing el$e hath part therein: and the Board of the
Adver$aries $wimmeth, when it is conjoyned with as much Air,
as, together with it, doth form a Body le$s grave than $o much water
as would fill the place that the $aid Compound occupyes in the
water; but when they $hall demit the $imple Ebony into
the water, according to the Tenour of our Que-
$tion, it $hall alwayes go to the bottom,
though it were as thin as a
Paper.</P>

that to endeavour the recovering and getting it from

by the Illu$trious Signory, for the Pre$ervation of the

and that although there were many that had tried, and

$mall expence, and that it had been $ever all times well
grappled and begirt, yet neverthele$s as far as I could
hear, none of them were able to rai$e her from that $mall
depth: And it being al$o told me, that of late there was
another $unk again in le$s than four Fathome of Water,
$o that all its Poope and Prow, and a greate part of its

<P>Before I come to declare the promi$ed way

<foot>Qqq I $ay,</foot>
<p n=>484</p>
<marg><I>Archimed.</I> of
Natation, Lib. 2.
Prop. 1.</marg>
<P>I $ay then; That its impo$$ible that the water $hould wholly
$wallow or receive into it any materiall Body lighter than it $elf (as
to $pecies;) but it will leave or cau$e one part thereof to lie above
the Superficies of the $aid water, that is uncovered by it. And as
the whole Body demitted into the water, is to the part thereof,
which $hall be received or admitted by the water, $o $hall the Spe-
cificall Gravity of the water, be unto the Specificall Gravity of the
$aid Solid Body.</P>
<marg><I>Archimed.</I> of
Natation, Lib. 1.
Prop. 7.</marg>
<P>But tho$e Solid Bodies which are more grave than the water; be-
ing demitted into the $aid water, $uddenly make the water to give
place; and not only enter wholly into the $ame, but they do go
continually de$cending, till they arrive at the bottom: And they
de$cend with $o much greater Velocity, by how much they exceed
the water in $pecificall Gravity.</P>
<marg><I>A chimed.</I> of
Natation, Lib. 1.
Prop. 111.</marg>
<P>And tho$e again which happen to be of the $ame Gravity with the
water, of nece$$ary con$equence being put into it, are admitted
and received totally into the $ame, but yet they $tay in the Surface
of the $aid water; that is, they $uffer not any part to lie above the
Superficies of the $aid water, nor much le$s doth the water con$ent
to their de$cent to the bottom.</P>
<P>And all this is demon$trated by <I>Archimedes</I> of <I>Syracu$a,</I> in that
his Tract <I>De in$identibus aqu&aelig;,</I> by us tran$lated. And becau$e the
greate$t part of woods are lighter, or le$s grave than the water; he
therefore that $hall build a Ship or other Ve$$el meerly of wood,
lighter than water, its manife$t that he cannot (though he $hould
fill the $ame with water, as full as it would hold) make the $ame
totally to $ink, but that nece$$arily $ome one part or other of the
$aid Ship or Ve$$el $hall $tand above the Surface of the water: For
its a thing very clear, that all that $ame Body, compounded of wood
and of water, would be much lighter than if it were all only of water
without wood: Such a compound Body therefore being le$s grave
than the water, its nece$$ary (for the rea$ons above produced) that
a part of the $ame remain above the Surface of the water.</P>
<P>And if the $aid Ship or Bark $hall be built (as it is u$ual) with
Bolts, Nailes, and other Materials of Iron, and that $uch Iron-
works be not of $uch quantity, as to make that Body compounded
of wood and Iron, graver than the water, but that it continue $till
le$s grave than the water (as I judge all Ships and Barks to be;) The
$ame will follow as did before, namely, that filling the $aid Ship
with water, as full as is po$ible, it cannot by any means go to the
bottom If then a Ship or other Ve$$el being wholly fill'd with
water, cannot be thereby $unk to the bottom; It is a thing evident,
that if $uch a Ship or Ve$$el $hall be totally fill'd with a Matter
lighter than the water; not only its totall $inking under that weight
<foot>will</foot>
<p n=>485</p>
will be impo$$ible, but al$o its floating in $ome part above the Sur-
face of the water will be nece$$ary: And $o much the greater part
$hall be vi$ible above the water, by how much the Matter of the
Lading, is lighter than the water.</P>
<P>Therefore, if all the Cargo of a Ship (for in$tance) Buts of Oyl,
and that no other Matters of a graver Nature than water were intro-
duced, and that the $aid Ship $hould by $ome Accident be filled
up with water, it is not only manife$t that the Ship cannot be there-
by $unk to the bottom, but that a part thereof mu$t nece$$arily float
above the Surface of the water: Becau$e all that Compo$ition of
Wood, Water and Oyl, would be lighter than if it had been all
$imply of water. The very $ame would follow, if the Cargo had
been $oley of Wine, Wax, Camphor, Spices, or the like Matters,
lighter than the water. But becau$e the Merchandizes that fraight
Ships, or other Ve$$els, are $ome ($pecifically) graver, and $ome
($pecifically) lighter than the water: (The graver are all forts of
Mettals, as Iron, Tinn, Lead, Bra$s, Copper, Silver, Gold, and infi-
nite other Species of Commodities; likewi$e the per$ons of Men,
Stones, Balla$ts, and the like:) And that al$o there are $ome $orts of
Commodities that chance to differ very little in Gravity from the
water: Therefore I conclude, that as oft as any Ship accidentally
is fill'd with water, and $o $inks by degrees to the bottom, it is ne-
ce$$ary to grant that all the Compo$ition, namely, of the Fraight,
of the Ve$$el, and of the water that entered into it, is more grave,
than if the compo$ition had been all $imply of water, by the rea$ons
before alledg'd.</P>
<P>And therefore in $uch a ca$e things graver than the water, mu$t
of nece$$ity exceed in force tho$e that be lighter: and by how much
things graver than the water, exceed the lighter, $o much the more
Force will be required to recover $uch a Ship or other Ve$$el being
$unk, and on the contrary, $o much le$s Force will be required,
when the Ma$s of the Materials more grave than the water, $hall
not differ much from the Ma$s of the le$s grave: provided the Re-
covery be undertaken in $ome $hort time after the Ship $hall be $unk,
For if the Ship lie many dayes under water, the delay will intro.
duce many difficulties: One will be, that it will con$olidate with
and dock or work it $elf farther into the Mudd or Sand, which will
not a little hinder its Recovery; and again, the water will continu-
ally carry into the $aid Ship, Ouze, Mudd, and Sand, which Mat-
ter is much graver than the water, whereby the Ship is continually
made graver as to the water, than it was at the beginning when it
was fir$t $ubmerg'd. And moreover the corruptible Matters, which
are by nature lighter than the water, will corrupt, and corrupting
will change into other earthy $ub$tances much graver than the
<foot>Qqq 2 water:</foot>
<p n=>486</p>
water: in$omuch that at the length, it ought to be pre$uppo$ed in
order to the recovery of the $aid Ship, as if it were $olely laden
with Mire, Dirt, and Sand: which doing, you will not be deceived
in the operation, that is to $ay, preparing and working with a Force
equivalent to that its Gravity. The way to know how to prepare
Forces equivalent to the Gravity $hall be $hewn in the eight Expla-
nation of this.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> II.</head>
<P>Now to give beginning to the bu$ine$s propo$ed, I $ay, that
in the Recovery of a Foundred Ship laden, or any other la-
den Ve$$el that is foundered or $unk, there interveneth more
e$pecially the$e three great Ob$tructions. The fir$t difficulty is, how
to imbreech and grapple it with $uch, and $o many Ropes, as may
$uffice to bear it up; for if this either by ill chance cannot be done
(whether through its being in a place two deep, or too far dockt in
the Mudd or Sand) all our other labour will be fru$trate and vain.</P>
<P>The $econd difficulty, when once it is grappled, is how with dex-
terity to $eperate it from the bottom of the Sea; and this d<*>ff<*>y
will be much greater, the Ship being in a Miry or Sandy bottom,
than if it $hall be in a Stony place; and it $hall be al$o a greater
difficulty to $eperate it from a very deep bottom, than from a Shal-
low; (alwayes $uppo$ing that the two bottoms be both alike, name-
ly, either both Stony or both Sandy;) and al$o far greater $hall the
$aid difficulty be in a Ship long $unk, than in one newly four dered;
(as we have already $aid in the precedent Explanation:) But when
$he is once water-born, or $eperated from the bottom, its an ca$ie
matter to rai$e her up to the Surface of the water; for then $he $hall
not be a little aleviated in her Gravity: But the truth is, the draw-
ing of it after wards above the Superficies of the water, is no very ca-
$ie matter, but is extream hard to be done; and this is the third
difficulty; the principal cau$e of which two la$t difficulties $hall be
a$$igned by and by.</P>
<P>But becau$e the means to obviate and $uperate the fir$t difficulties
<marg>* <I>The Author be-
lieved (as he de-
clareth in the E-
pi$tle to the en$u-
ing Suppliment of
this his</I> Inventi-
on) <I>that the Ma-
riners conver$ant in the$e affairs, had many wayes to imbreech a Ve$$el uuder water; and for that rea$on he
over pa$$eth it here, and is very cur$ive upon the $ame Point, in the $econd Book, but giveth a generall Rule
for it in the $aid Suppliment: to which the Reader is referred for fuller Satisfaction.</I></marg>
as more ^{*} common, we $hall forbear to $peak of them untill the
next Book. To provide, and that briefly, to the $econd and third
impediments (which are the lea$t known) that is, not only to $e-
perate the Ship from the bottom, but to rai$e it al$o $omewhat above
the Surface of the water.</P>
<foot>And</foot>
<p n=>487</p>
<P>And this is the Rule that you mu$t ob$erve; If the Ship be newly
$unk, you mu$t immediately, if it be po$$ible, find two other Ships,
that be each of them rather of greater bulk than the foundered Ship
than le$s: and when you have found the$e two Ships, you mu$t
free them of all the inward and outward lading, and rigging, e$pe-
cially of tho$e things which are by nature more grave than the water,
as are the Guns, the Shot, and any kind of Balla$t, which is pre$up-
po$ed to be in the Hold, and of other things of impediment; and
when the$e Ships are thus cleared, you mu$t $top all the Loop-holes,
Cat-holes, Skuppers and Hau$es, which you $hall finde between or
above Decks, graving and calking them $o with Okum, and paying
them with Pitch, that the water can neither get in nor out thereat.
And next you mu$t join or grapple the$e two Ships together with five
or more Tires or Orders of thick and $trong Beames tripplicated;
that is, that each of the $aid Orders con$i$t of three Beams, joyned
lengthways; and that each of the three Beams be $omewhat longer
than the bredth of the Deck or Hull of each Ship; and that theybe
thick and $trong, as being to $upport the Foundered Ship, as you
$hall $ee it made to appear pre$ently: and couple the $aid Ships to-
gether, at $uch a di$tance from each other, that you give berth, or
leave room enough betwixt for the foundered Ship to play; and
you mu$t make this couppling in $uch $ort, that the length or $ide
of the one Ship, look towards the length or $ide of the other; and
albeit this conjunction or grappling may be made with many Orders
or Tires of tho$e Bcams tripplicated lengthways, as was $aid above,
<cap><I>The Figurall repre$entation of the two empty Ships, conjoyned with
five Orders of Beams, and towed ju$t over the place where the
Foundered Ship is.</I></cap>
<fig>
yet that we may not cau$e confu$ion in the Figure, we would have
this colligation to be made only of five Rows, as appeareth in the
<foot>Scheme</foot>
<p n=>488</p>
Scheme: and although the $aid Rows of Beames cannot be all
placed equidi$tant from the Surface of the water, for that the
Wailes or Rifings of the two Ships are not flu$h, but cuved, it is
not of any importance, $o that they be well fa$tened and $trength-
ened in tho$e places where they re$t upon the $aid Rifings: upon
which Ri$ings, you $hall conjoyn the $aid Beams, namely, the two
ends of them, which two ends $hall be the $tronge$t place, able to
$upport any great weight. Yet the truth is, that to fit the$e Tires
of Beams, you need not have regard to make them pa$s through from
$ide to $ide, in that weak part of the Ships Poop and Prow, to re$t
them on the Rifings or Gun-wales of the Deck of tho$e Ships, and
to go cro$s the Hull in tho$e places. And next you are to make upon
the$e Beams, that is upon the mouths of both the Ships, a Plat-form
of Planks for to $tand upon whil$t you are about the work; leaving
diver$e Scuttles or Spaces open, whereby to de$cend, aud for other
u$es: And all this being done, you are to tow or hall the$e Ve$$els
to the place where the Ship is that did $ink, and to lay them Board
and Board in $uch fa$hion, that the one may lie on one $ide of it, and
the other upon the other, as in the Scheme is apparent.</P>
<P>This being done, fill tho$e two Ships as full of water as they can
hold or $wim, (the way to free them with great facility and expe-
dition, $hall be $hewn in the twelfth Explanation;) and being full,
wait the time of low water; that is, when the Tide returning, the
Sea doth low as much as it can do; and at that in$tant of time,
make the Ship very fa$t with tho$e ends of Cords or Cables (with
which it was Swite or bound) to tho$e five, or more Tires of Beams,
wherewith the fore$aid two Ships were imbreecht or grappled: And
having well belayd or fa$tned tho$e Cables, you mu$t bale or take
out a $mall part of the water out of one of the two Ships, and then
let it re$t $o, till $uch time as you have baled or taken a little more
than that quantity out of the other Ship; and then again take a
little more out of the fir$t Ship, and leave it $o till you have taken
another $uch a quantity from the other Ship, and thus proceed gra-
dually, till you find the Foundered Ship, water-born or loo$ned
from the bottom: but being water-born (if it be in a Showle bot-
tom, as was that at <I>Malamoccho)</I> you are to take out the $aid water,
equally from both the Ships, at one and the $aid time, to the end
the Ship may ri$e evenly without $wagging or $haking; and thus you
are to proceed till you have taken all the water from the one &amp; the
other of the two Ships: In $o doing, you $hall $ee the two Shpis lea-
$urely and gently rai$e the Ship that was $unk, $o high above the
Surface of the water, that you may commodiou$ly free it, and
di$charge it of its lading, as appeareth in the following Figures.
And if you would not keep the two Ships $o long imploy'd, you may
<foot>warpe</foot>
<p n=>489</p>
warpe or towe the Foundered Ship at high-water to $ome place
where it may lie a-ground: and by that means upon the Ebbe or
Rece$$ion of the Tide, it will lie much more above water; and then
you may $afely unfa$ten it from tho$e five or more Tires of Beames,
to which it was at fir$t tyed, to hall it to a place of $afety, as it was
our purpo$e to do; and this $hall $ucceed as well in an ouzie bot-
tom, as in a Stony, This though you may take notice of, that if
the Cargo of this new Foundred Ship was $uch, that the things more
grave than the water, did not much exceed the le$s grave, <*> would
be ea$ie to effect the recovery with two Ships, very much le$s than
tho$e which we have $poken of above; yet neverthele$s it will be
good prudence to take them rather bigger than le$$er, that $o they
may exceed 200000 pounds in Power, rather than want one only
ounce in Act; e$pecially in ca$e you would in a deep place at the
fir$t motion hoi$t it by meer Force $omewhat above the Surface of
the water, for in that point alone it will require incomparably much
more force, than in all the other operations.</P>
<P>How you are to preceed, in ca$e the Ship $hould be $unk in a
place very deep, $hall be declared in the $eaventh Explanation. The
Figures of this Explanation are the$e two that folllow.</P>

<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> III.</head>
<P>But if it $o fall out, that you cannot on $nch an in$tant, finde
two Ships of the $ame Bulk with the Ship $unk, you may take
four $maller; provided, that all the four together hold twice
as much burden as the Ship $unk, and rather more than le$s. Which
four $mall Ships being all fir$t cleer'd of their lading, and well $topt
in all their Skuppers and Portholes (as was $aid in the two) you mu$t
couple them with Beams and good Planks, by two and two, as you
u$e to do with two Lighters, when you would make a Bridge of
them: and the$e two pair of Hoys or Barkes thus coupled together,
you mu$t afterwards fa$ten one pair to another, with $even of tho$e
Tires or Rows of thick and $trong Beams tripplicated, as was $aid in
the precedent Explanation; and place them at $uch a di$tance one
pair from another, as that you may leave berth or $pace enough for
the $unk or foundered Ship to ri$e between them, and $ome what
more, (as was $aid of the two.) And though this conjunction of the
two pair of Ships, may be made three $everall wayes, yet I will have
you make the two Poops or Hin decks of the one couple, to lie op-
po$ite to the two Poops of the other couple. And to make this
conjunction, you are to place two Tires of tho$e great Beams along
the upper parts of the $aid Poops, $o, that they may re$t in the in-
$ide on tho$e le$$er Beams and Planks, where with each of tho$e two
pair of Ships were coupled: and each of the$e Orders or Tires of
<foot>Beames</foot>
<p n=>491</p>
Beames ought to be compo$ed of three Beams conjoyned length-
wayes, as was $aid in the precedent Explanation; and make two of
the Tires lie upon the Ships; and to tho$e Tires, let that $unk Ship
be grappled: and another Tire of the $aid Beams is to be placed in
the mid$t between the one and the other couple; and two other
Tires of the $aid Beams ought to be fa$tened upon the one and other
$ide, that is, upon the Rifings or Bends of tho$e two couples of
Ships; and that being done, there will be in all $even Tires or Or-
ders of Beams; which $eaven Orders of Beams ought conjunctly to
be prolonged, on the one and on the other $ide. almo$t to the
length of the Hull of each Ship, as in the Figure is reprere<*>d: and
<cap><I>The Figur all <*>ple how to recover a Foundered Ship with four
$mall Ship</I></cap>
<fig>
this being done, you are to proceed, as hath been $hewn in the two,
that is, fill them top full of water, and at low water, imbreech the
Ship $unk very well, withall tho$e ends of Ropes or Cables, that
you did belay to tho$e $even Tires of Beams: and when tho$e
Grapplings $hall be well made fa$t; you $hall at high water bale or
free the water by little and little out of the Ships, one pair after a-
nother, till you feel the foundered Ship is di$engaged from the bot-
tom, and water-born, as was $aid in the two. And having $epera-
ted it from the bottom (if it be in a $hallow place, as was that where
the Ship was foundered neer <I>M<*>lamoccbo</I>) you are to proceed to let
out the re$t of the $aid water, but take it equally and gradually from
the one and the other pair, that they may de$cend evenly, and with-
out heeling, as was $aid of the two; and in $o doing, the $aid Ship
$hall not only be hoi$ted up to the Surface of the water, but much
<foot>Rrr above</foot>
<p n=>492</p>
above the $ame; $o that you may in that po$ture free or drain it
and di$charge it of the Cargo. But if you cannot $o long $pare
tho$e four Ships from other u$es, then you may at high water tow
it to $ome place, where running it on ground, you may at the ebbe
of the Tide (for that then there will lie much more of it above wa-
ter) $afely loo$e it from tho$e Beames, as was al$o $aid in the prece-
dent Explanation of the two Ships.</P>
<P>But in ca$e the Foundered Ship $hould chance to be in a very deep
Sea, in the $eventh Explanation (to be the briefer in this place)
$hall be $hewn how you are to proceed.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> IV.</head>
<P>And if it happen that it $hould be in a place where there are
no Ships to be got, either great cr little; you may take of
other kind of Pinaces, Barks or Barges, but endeavour to
get $uch as are floaty, and highe$t built in there Rifings, that $o they
may, at $uch time as they are full of water, de$cend very far under
water, (or according to the Mariners phra$e, may draw much wa-
ter) and of the$e you mu$t $top all the Skuppers, Haw$es, Cat-holes
and Port holes, that you finde, as in the Ships, that they may hold
the more water, and con$equently draw the more water, or be de-
pre$$ed deeper into the $ame; and take $o many couple of the$e
Botes, that they may all together contain double the burden of
the Ship to be recovered, and rather much more, than any thing
le$s. And of all the$e Boats or Barks, make two Squadrons, conjoyning
each Squadron with good $mall Timbers &amp; Planks, as you u$e to do,
when you would make a Bridge of Boats: And the$e $ame Ve$$els of
the one and other divi$ion, $hould be placed board and board, that $o
the great Beams, which are to conjoyn one Squadron to the other,
may bear upon the Rifings, Bends or Wales, of the $aid Ve$$els. And
this being done, you are to couple the$e two Squadrons, to each other
with tho$e thick and $trong Tires of Beams, mentioned in the former
Explanations, which Orders of Beams $hould be fixed between two &amp;
two of tho$e Botes, as is $aid above, to the end, that they may bear or
re$t upon the Bends of tho$e Boats; and place another Tire upon the
out$ides of both the Divi$ions, upon the ends of the cro$s $mall Beams
which hold the $everall Ve$$els together: So that if the Squadrons con-
$i$ted each of four Barks, the Tires of the $aid Beams would come to
be five,; and if there $hould be five in a Squadron, the Tires of
Beams would be $ix, and $o forwards; that is, the Orders of Beams, by
this means, $hall be alwayes one more than the number of Botes in
each Squadron. But in the Ships you mu$t ob$erve another method,
becau$e of tho$e two Orders, which are placed in each Poop; by
<foot>which</foot>
<p n=>493</p>
<cap><I>The way to recover a Foundered Ship with many Barks or Wherryes.</I></cap>
<fig>
which means in every two Ships to a Divi$ion (which in all make
four Ships) there mu$t be $even Orders of Beams, and in three Ships
to a Squadron, there mu$t be ten Orders of Beams, and in four
Ships to a Squadron thirteen; and thus proceeding forwards to a
greater number of Ships in a Squadron. And having under$tood the
way of coupling many Barks or Wherryes in Squadrons; as al$o the
manner how to joyn or fa$ten them to each other, and with how
many Orders of Beams; you are to proceed in the re$t, as in the
precedent Explanations hath been demon$trated in $howle bottoms,
but the directions how to manage this affair in deep places, $hall be
declared in the $eventh Explanation.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> V.</head>
<P>To remove this inconvenience of taking Ships or other Ve$$els;
and of $tanding to lighten them of their Guns &amp; lading, and of
$topping their Loop-holes; you may in$uch a misfortune cau$e
to be made two great Ve$$els, almo$t in form of ^{*} Che$ts without co-
<marg>* Of the$e Ve$-
$els Cardinall

u$e at the Siege
of <I>Rochell</I> to <*>

vers, the length of each to be equal to the Hull of a middle rate Ship,
and the breadth equall to that of the $ame Ship at the Main-ma$t,
and the height al$o the $ame with that of the Ship in the Bow, $o
that each of the$e Plat forms or Che$ts, $hall hold much more than
a common Ship, and thus both will contain more than the double
burden of $uch a Ship. And for the making of the$e Ve$$els, you
mu$t fir$t make the Models in Carvel-manner of thick and $trong
Timber, with their Eutertaces, Tran$omes and Knees, to hold their
$ides and ends together: and this done, $pike down to them certain
<foot>Rrr2 thick</foot>
<p n=>494</p>
thick and $trong Planks; and then cau$e them to be well graved and
calked in the Seames or Strakes by a Calker, with Okum, and paid
with Pitch, as you u$e to do Ships or Gallyes, and then apply them
to your purpo$e. And when you would u$e them, you need only
fa$ten them together with tho$e five or more Orders of thick and
lu$ty Beams, trippled lengthwayes, that is, prolonged both wayes,
$o as that they may lie athwart the Decks of the $aid two Ve$$els,
and place the $aid Ships $o far di$tant from each other, as you gue$$e
the bredth of the Foundered Ship to be, and $omething more: And
then make upon the Deck of each of them, that is, upon tho$e
Beams, a Plat-form of Planks, as was $aid in the two Ships of the
$econd Explanation, and afterwards proceed as in tho$e two Ships.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> VI.</head>
<P>And inca$e you think the making of a couple of $uch great
Modles or Ve$$els, as we mentioned in the foregoing Ex-
planation, would be too great a trouble or expence; you
may make two pair of $uch Che$ts, each of them but of hal$ the
bulk of one of the former: but if you judge the$e two pair too
trouble$ome, you may make three, four, or more pairs; alwayes
provided, that among$t them all they hold about twi$e the burden
of the Ship $unk; and the$e Frames when you would u$e them, mu$t
be joyned together in two Ranks, with le$$er Beams and Planks,
as was $aid of the four Boats or Wherryes; and then fa$ten the$e
two Ranks to each other at the requi$ite di$tance, with great and
$trong tripplicated Beams, as was $aid of the Ships, Barks and Boats;
and then operate as you was to do with tho$e: alwayes remembring
in the freeing or emptying the $aid Ve$$els, to bale out the water by
little and little fir$t from one Rank, and then from the other; and
$o proceed interchangeably till you percieve that the Ship is clear of
the bottom: and being di$engaged, if it be in a $hallow place,
continue taking the water equally out of the one and other Divi$i-
on of Ve$$els, till all the water be drained out of them, as was requi-
red upon the former Explanations: but if it be $unk in a deep Sea,
the next Explanation $hall $hew how you are to proceed; and that
briefly.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> VII.</head>
<P>And in ca$e the $aid Ship newly $unk, chance to be in a very
deep bottom; It will be nece$$ary fir$t to fix upon tho$e
two or four Ships, or upon tho$e two Squadrons of Barks,
Fly-boats or Wherryes, at lea$t $ix or eight Cap$tains, Ship-Cranes
<foot>or</foot>
<p n=>495</p>
or Windla$$es, with their nece$$ary Garnets or Pullies, requi$ite to
$nch a weight: and you may ea$ily accomodate the$e Pullies, to tho$e
Orders of great Beams, wherewith the $aid Ve$$els were conjoyned.
And having prepared the$e Cap$tains, you are to proceed in all
things, as hath been directed you in the precedent Explanations,
excepting only in this, that whil$t you are freeing the water alter-
nately by degrees out of the two or more Ships, or from the two
Squadrons of Barks, Fly-boats or Wherryes, as $oon as you finde
the Foundered Ship to be water-born or got clear of the bottom of
the Sea, I would have you cea$e to take any more water forth of
the $aid Ships, or le$$er Ve$$els before filled; and I would have you
with tho$e Cap$tains, attempt to draw the $aid Ship that was funk
unto the Levell or Surtace of the water, or to lie Horizontal unto it,
which may be ea$ily done, for that its pondero$ity will be much di-
mini$hed. And when you have drawn it to the Surface of the water,
then I would have you di$charge all the other water out of the two
Ships, or the two Squadrons of $mall Ve$$els. And this $econd wa-
ter, I would have raken equally, and at the $ame time, from the one
and the other Ship, or from each Rank of Barks or Boats, as hath
been $aid of the other. And thus tho$e Ships or Squadrons of Boats
$hall hoi$t the $aid Foundered Ship, $o high above the Superficies of
the water, that you may free it of the water which was got into it,
and unlade its Cargo, which was our purpo$e.</P>
<P>You mu$t note, that all that hath been hitherto $aid of a Ship
newly $unk, ought to be under$tood of all other kind of Foundered
Ships, proceeding alwayes proportionately as was directed in that
Ship. And again, I give you no Figure how you are to fit and fix
the Cap$tains and Pullies, as being a thing common and manife$t.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> VIII.</head>
<P>But if it $o fall out, that the $aid Ship or other Ve$$el hath been
$unk many Months; albeit that there might have been many
matters in the Cargo of a lighter nature than water, yet you
mu$t $uppo$e the ca$e as if the Ship were as heavy as if it had been
fil'd with Sand or Gravel; yea and much heavier, for many Rea$ons,
as hath been alledg'd in the fir$t Explanation. Therefore that you
may not deceive your $elves in the de$igned recovering of it, you
would do well to double the Forces required to the recovery of a
new $unk Ship; that is, you mu$t take four Ships, each as big as
the Foundered <I>S</I>hip, and combine the$e four <I>S</I>hips, as you were re-
quired to joyn the four $mall <I>S</I>hips in the third Explanation. And
if you cannot procure them of that burthen, take eight le$$er, pro-
vided that altogether they be quadruple in contence to the <I>S</I>hip to
<foot>be</foot>
<p n=>496</p>
to be recovered: and divide the$e eight le$$er <I>S</I>hips or Barks into
two <I>S</I>quadrons, of four in a <I>S</I>quadron, according as you was di-
rected in the four Ships in the third direction. And if you cannot pro-
cure <I>S</I>hips great or $mal, take $o many pair of other Ve$$els, Fly boats
or Wherryes, that in all they may at lea$t contain four times the bur-
then of the Foundered <I>S</I>hip: And reduce the$e Barks, Boats or
Wherryes into two Divi$ions, as you are taught in the fourth Ex-
planation: and in all other particulars, proceed according to the
method pre$cribed in the recovery of the <I>S</I>hip newly $unk; and
that as well in deep, as $hallow places; that is, placing in a deep
<I>S</I>ea upon the $aid Ships, or <I>S</I>quadrons of Boats, at lea$t twelve or
$ixteen Cap$tains, which it will be ea$ie to do, for that you will have
a large $pace upon tho$e <I>S</I>hips or ranks of Boats, as al$o there will
not want room to fa$ten their Pullies to tho$e Tires of Beams, which
combine the $aid <I>S</I>hips or ranks of Boats. In all things el$e proceed
preci$ely according as you have been directed in the $econd, third,
fourth, fifth, $ixth and $eventh Explanations.</P>
<P>This indeed mu$t be granted, that inca$e the $aid <I>S</I>hip long $unk,
$hould be in a <I>S</I>tony bottom, or where $he hath a great current, the
which current $uffereth not any great bed or $helves of Mudd to
gather about the $aid <I>S</I>hip, it may then ea$ily be got clear of the bot-
tom, with the $ame Forces as were imploy'd in that newly $unk, to
recover it; and al$o may as ea$ily be drawn to the Surface of the
water: But whether you can rai$e it with part of its Hull above
the <I>S</I>uperficies of the water, is a thing much to be doubted;
yet if it $hould prove $o upon the Experiment, namely, that you
cannot elevate its Hull above the <I>S</I>urface of the water, you may in
$uch a ca$e hall it at high water to $hore, or to $ome place where it
may lie a ground, whereby at the retreat of the Tide, it will lye with
part of its Hull above water, $o that you may commodiou$ly clear
it of the imbibed water and Cargo.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> IX.</head>
<P>And to the end that this invention may be of generall u$e
for the re covery or rai$ing any kind of Collo$$us, that may
happen to be $unk, to wit, of all <I>S</I>pecies of <I>S</I>olid Bodies,
whether of <I>S</I>tone, Iron, Pewter, Bra$s, Lead, <I>S</I>ilver or Gold (as you
may have many occa$ions voluntarily to $ink them in time of war, to
pre$erve them) and then that you may know how to get them up
again, you mu$t ob$erve this Rule: If the <I>S</I>olid long time $ubmer-
ged were of Brick; $o $oon as it is imbreecht, you mu$t take $o ma-
ny couple of <I>S</I>hips, Barks, Hoyes or Wherryes, that the $um of their
contents put together, may exceed the <I>S</I>quare of the <I>S</I>olid Area
of the $ubmerged <I>S</I>olid: and if the <I>S</I>olid $o long $unk were of Mar-
<foot>ble</foot>
<p n=>497</p>
ble, the <I>S</I>olid Content of all the <I>Vacua</I> of tho$e <I>S</I>hips or Ve$$els ad-
ded together, mu$t not be le$s than Septuple to the Solid Content
of the $ubmerged Body; namely, $even times as much. And if
that long $unk Solid chance to be of Iron; you mu$t make the Solid
Content of all the <I>Vacuum's</I> of tho$e Ve$$els to be no le$$e in the
Aggregate than 12 3/2 times as much as the Solid Content of that $ub-
merged Solid: and the like mu$t be done, if the $ubmerged Solid
be of Pewter, for that Iron and Pewter differ not much in Gravity.
But and if the drowned <I>S</I>olid be of Copper, it is requi$ite that the
<I>S</I>olid Content of all the Ve$$els Cavities in $um, be no le$s than
thirteen times as much as the <I>S</I>olid Content of the $aid <I>S</I>olid $unk.
And if the $ubmerged <I>S</I>olid were of Lead, the <I>S</I>olid Content of all
the <I>Vacua</I> of tho$e <I>S</I>hips, wherewith you would recover it, $hould
be no le$s than twenty times as much as the <I>S</I>olid content of the
drowned <I>S</I>olid, and rather more than le$s; and almo$t the $ame
proportion ought to be ob$erved, if the $ubmerged Solid were of fine
Silver, for that Lead and pure Silver differ not much in Gravity:
truth is, that Lead is $omewhat more weighty than Silver, but not
much.</P>
<P>But if the Solid which was $unk, $hould chance to be of pure
Gold, you mu$t for its recovery take $o many couple of Barks or
Boats, that the Solid Content of their <I>Vacua,</I> taken in aggregate,
may be no le$s than 34 times as much as the Solid content of the
$aid Golden Solid $ubmerged. And that you may the better under-
$tand me, I will put an Example, that you were to recover or rai$e
out of the water, a Solid Body re$embling a great Tower, which I
imagine to be in length an 100 Paces, and in breadth 10, and in
thickne$s al$o ten: and I $uppo$e that it is all one <I>S</I>olid, that is to
$ay, not hollow within. And fir$t we put the ca$e that this Tower
were made of Brick. Now becau$e the <I>S</I>olid Content of this $up-
po$ed <I>S</I>olid would be 10000 cubical Paces: therefore in this ca$e,
if you would recover this $ame Body, that is, not only loo$en it from
the bottom of the <I>S</I>ea, but al$o rai$e it a good height above water,
it will be requi$ite, as is $aid above, to take $o many pair of Ships,
Barks, Boats, or other Ve$$els, (as hath been $hewn in the 5 and 6
Explanation) that the <I>S</I>olid Content of all the <I>Vacua</I> of them put
together, be not le$s than four times the $aid $um of 10000 cubick
Paces; that is, it mu$t not be under 40000 cubicall Paces, as was
above determined. And $o &igrave;f it happen that the $aid $ubmerged So-
lid $hould be all of Marble, the <I>S</I>olid Content of all the Vacuities
of the $aid <I>S</I>hips, ought not to be le$s than 70000 cubicall Paces,
namely Septuple, as was before concluded. And thus if the $unk.
<I>S</I>olid were all of Iron or Pewter, the aggregate of all the <I>S</I>olid Con-
tent of all tho$e <I>Vacuums</I> put together, mu$t be rather more than
<foot>le$s</foot>
<p n=>498</p>
le$s then 126666 2/3 cubical Paces. And in ca$e the Solid were all of
Copper, the Solid Content of the $aid <I>Vacua</I> ought to be about
130000 cubick Paces. And likewi$e if the Solid were all of Lead
or Silver, the Solid Content of all the $aid <I>Vacua</I> is to be no le$s than
200000 Paces cubical. La$tly, if $uch $ubmerged Solid be pro-
pounded all of fine Gold, the $um of tho$e Cavities ought to be no
le$s than 340000 cubick Paces.</P>
<P>The manner how to proceed in the recovery of tho$e $everall
kinds of Solids, is to be under$tood to be like to that which was
pre$cribed in the recovery of the Ship: and that as well in deep, as
$hallow waters. And the greater number of Ships or Boats are re-
quired to opperate in the recovery of the $aid $ubmerged Solid in a
deep Channell, $o much the more room mu$t yon take upon the
one and the other Squadron, for to be able to pitch $uch a number
of Cap$tens as $hall be needfull, and more if occa$ion be. Yet you
mu$t ob$erve, that in the taking the water alternately from the one
and other Squadron, when you perceive the $aid Solid to be di$-
engaged from the bottom, you are to forbear taking out any more
from either of them; as was appointed touching the Ship, in the
$eventh Explanation. And make u$e of as many Pullies as you $hall
$ee cau$e for, not only to lift it to, but al$o to draw it above the
waters Surface: and that if notwholly, yet for the greater part:
and when it is lifted as high as is po$ible, then take the remaining
water by equall mea$ures, out of the one and other Squadron, or
Rank of Ships; which being done, it $hall be hoi$ted $o high out of
the water, that you may put under it as many Lighters or Flat-boats,
as $hall be $ufficient to bear it up, and to carry it to any place, as
occa$ion $hall require.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION X.</I></head>
<P>Albeit <I>Vitruvius, Vegetius</I> and <I>Valturius</I> do teach diver$e and $un-
dry wayes to carry water up on high, many whereof may
$tand us in much $tead in this our Invention, for the commo-
dious filling and emptying all the $everall kinds of Ve$$els $poken of
above; of which al$o, many are very well known and familiar to
every one; to wit, with Bur-pumps, Chain pumps, common-pumps,
and many others: yet neverthele$s to fill the $aid Ships or other
Ve$$els with water, with great facility and dexterity; I judge this
more expedient than any of them; namely, to make a Hole in the
bottom of each of tho$e Ships or other Ve$$els, of two or three inches
Diameter at lea$t, and for every Ship to appoint a Boome or long
tapered Pole like a Plugg or Tapp, $o that being thru$t into the $aid
Hole, it will $top it $o clo$e, that unle$s you con$ent thereto, no
<foot>water</foot>
<p n=>499</p>
water can enter in thereat, and this Pole is to be $omewhat longer
than to reach from the Keel to the upper deck of the $aid Ship; and
near the other end, put another piece of a Pole cro$s wayes; that
you may be able by means of that to rule it; namely, to pull it up,
when you would un$top the Hole, to let in the water that $hould
fill the Ship, and to thru$t it down when you would $top the Hole
that no more water may enter; and this $ame Pole $hould pa$s
through two Rings, fixed in the Hold of the Ship, which are to
keep the $aid Pole directly over the Hole, that if you would $top it,
the Plugg or Spiggot may not go be$ides the Hole, when you thru$t
the Pole downwards. And that I may be the better under$tood, I
have here below drawn the $ame Pole, with its Tapp or Plugg at the
end. And when you go about to recover any Ship, you mu$t $top
the $aid Holes, till $uch time as the $aid Ships are carried
<fig>
and fitted upon the place, as is $hewn above. And
when you would fill them with water, it is but with-
drawing the $aid Poles, and opening the Holes; and
fa$ten them at that $tay, till you have a mind to $top
the Holes; and then look downwards, and ob$erve
when the Ships are as full as they can $wim, or when
they are full enough, which will be in a very $hort
time: and then let down tho$e Poles, and $top the
Holes very clo$e. And when they are as full as they
need, in the ebb of the Tide, combine the Ship with the Pullies, to
tho$e five or more Orders of Beams often mentioned: and then draw
out the water with Pumps by little and little, and one while out of
one, and another while out of the other Ship, as was appointed in
the $econd Explication: and in all other particulars proceed, as was
al$o there directed But if the Gravity of tho$e Ve$$els, cau$eth
them not to fill fa$t enough, you mu$t fill them at the top, that is
by baling in water by the Deck (I mean the $aid Poles being fir$t
thru$t down) to make the $aid Ve$$els to de$cend fa$ter, and to rai$e
the Matter $ubmerged with more Force; many other new wayes
might be $hewn, as well to empty, as to fill the$e Ve$$els; but for
the pre$ent this $hall $uffice.</P>

<head>THE
Indu$trious or Trouble$ome
INVENTION
OF
Nicholaus Tartalea:</head>
<head><I>BOOKE</I> II.</head>
<P>In which are taught, $ome artificial wayes of <I>Diving</I>
and $taying long under Water: whereby one may
ea$ily de$cend to the Bottom, to finde out, not on-
ly a Ship $unke, but al$o, any other $mall thing of
Value: And the place being darke, many wayes
are $hewn how to enlighten it: And the thing
$unk being found, $everall wayes and means are
pre$cribed how to imbreach them, as well in a
Deepe, as Shallow Channel.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> I.</head>
<P>Having under$tood, <I>Mo$t Serene Prince,</I> from $un-
dry Sea men, that there are many now adayes,
who without any particular Artifice or help, do
upon occa$ion dive and continue a long time
under Water, and in places very deep; I had
thought to have added nothing touching the
way of Artificiall Diving, and $taying under
water, to $eeke and finde out a Ship, Boare,
or other thing of Value $ubmerged, and that for two Rea$ons. Fir$t,
Fearing that I $hould be derided by tho$e kinde of men, it being to
them a $uperfluous thing to go about to do tho$e things by Art,
which they know how to execute without any arrificiall help.
<foot>Se-</foot>
<p n=>501</p>
Secondly, doubting, by rea$on of my $mall experience in Maratine
Affairs, to incurre $ome Soleci$me: but there coming into my mind
an excellent expre$$ion of a famous Philo$opher of this Renowned
City; who upon a time per$wading me to write $omething that
was new, and I having an$wered (it being incident for humanly to
erre) that I was afraid lea$t my $o great de$ire to publi$h my fund y
new Conjectures, might run me into $ome fanta$tical conceits, that
might make me become the $ubject of vulgar di$cour$e, this excel-
lent per$on replied: That if Nature $hould forbear her operations for
fear of producing $ometimes $ome mon$trous things, the worlds de-
$truction would en$ue, for that they onely are free from erring who
do nothing, who$e $peech hath emboldened me to $peak of a point,
which I never thought to have medled with; namely, To declare
$ome of my conjectural wayes of artificial diving, and continuing
under water, to $eek out any thing that was $unk in the $ame, though
in places very deep. And I judge the$e the mo$t expedient that can
be devi$ed: and becau$e the$e and the like wayes may be varied
into $everal forms, and $orts, one more ingenious, and artificial than
another; the prettie$t, and mo$t ingenious is this, I would have you
<marg>A Place near to
<I>Venice,</I> where the
famous Glahes
are made.</marg>
get, made at <I>Murano,</I> a hollow Globe of Tran$parent Gla$$e, the di-
ameter of which I would have to be at lea$t two foot, with a round
mouth, that the Diameter of the $aid mouth may be at lea$t one
foot, or wrather more; that is, $o much as one may ea$ily put his
head therein, and at plea$ure draw it forth; and next you mu$t
make two round Boards of a Diameter $omething bigger then that
of the $aid Globe, and with the$e two round Boards, and four $len-
der pieces of Wood, as long as a man is high, and a little more, you
mu$t make a little Modell for a man to $tand betwixt the$e four pie-
<marg>Like the Frame
of an Houre-
gla$$e.</marg>
ces of Wood; and with one of the round Boards above, and the o-
ther beneath; and the$e round Boards are to be very fa$t nailed or
otherwi$e fa$tened to the four pieces of the Frame, and in the top of
this Machine, you mu$t fit and fix the $aid Sphere of Gla$$e with the
mouth downwards, $o, that if a man $tand upright in the $aid Frame,
he may hold his head in the $aid gla$$e without $tooping. And this
being done, take neer upon as much Lead as all this Machine weighs,
and make it into a round figure, of the compa$$e of the round
Boards, and then fa$ten and nail it to the bottome of the $aid Mo-
dell, namely, underneath the lowermo$t Board on which your feet
$tand when you put it into the Water: And then, (or before)
make an hole as big as a Shilling in the Centre of this Lead and
Board, pa$$ing through them both; and this $ame Lead will be able
to draw almo$t all the Machine together with him that $hall be
therein under Water. Truth is, that the Experiment requireth that
the $aid Lead be $o limitted that it may be able to draw the Ma-
<foot>S$$ 2 chine</foot>
<p n=>502</p>
chine and per$on in it under Water, but $o, that the $upreme or up
per part of the $ame, that is the uppermo$t round Board, may $tay at
the Superficies of the Water; that is, if the Lead chance to be $o
ponderous, that it cau$e the Engine to $ink lei$urely to the bottome,
you mu$t take away $ome of the $aid Lead; and on the contrary,
if it chance that the Lead be not able to draw it all in that manner
under Water, $o as to make the $aid upper round Board to lye and
$tay exactly level with the Surface of the Water, but that a part of it
re$ts vi$ible above the Water, you mu$t encrea$e the $aid Lead $o,
that the upper Board may lye and abide preci$ely, as was $aid be-
fore, in the Surface of the Water: and when you have thus adju-
$ted the $aid Lead, I would have you take a Ball or Bullet of Lead
weighing two or three pounds, (that is to $ay of $uch a weight, that
it may be $ufficient to make the Machine and per$on diving to de-
$cend to the bottome as oft as it is interpo$ed, or added,) with an
Iron Ring in the $aid Ball, to which bend or fa$ten a Rope as long as
the $aid Water is deep, in which the Diver is to de$cend, and $ome-
what more; and reeve or pa$$e the other end of the $aid
Cord through the hole
made in the Board and
Lead through the bot-
<fig>
tom of the Model; and
fa$ten that $ame end
of the Cord in a place
of the Machine, $o, that
the Diver may take it,
and draw it, or $lack
it as he plea$eth: and
this being done, the
$aid Machine will be
fini$hed. And that you
may better under-
$tand it, I have here in-
$erted it graphically:
yet I $hould have told
you, that for many rea-
ons you $hould in the beginning have fa$tened a Ring in the Cen-
tre of the upper Board, on the out$ide, to tye a Cord to the $ame as
occa$ion $erveth.</P>
<foot><I>EXPLA-</I></foot>
<p n=>503</p>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> II.</head>
<P>Having under$tood the manner how to make this $ame En-
gine, it remains to $hew how it is to be u$ed; And for your
direction therein, I $ay, That he that would dive or go under
Water to $eek any thing that was $unk, $hould carry the $aid Ma-
chine to the place where he re$olves to de$cend, and fir$t to let that
Ball of Lead with the Line go to the bottome, and then to put in
the Machine it $elf, which by means of its heavy bottome of Lead
will re$t upright in the Water, with almo$t all the Globe of Gla$$e
above Water, in $uch $ort, that he that would may ea$ily enter into
the $ame: yet you mu$t be dexterous in going into it, that you do
not much $way the Machine $idewayes, for that, if it lye too oblique
the Water will enter into the Globe of Gla$$e, and drive the Aire
thence that was in the $ame, or at lea$t in part, but holding it up-
right when you enter the $ame, the Water $hall keep in the Aire on
all $ides, whereby the water will be kept from entring. And therefore
if he that $hall enter into the $aid Machine, do nimbly thru$t his head
into the $aid Globe by the hole thereof, he $hall finde it quite fil-
led with Ayre; in which place he may breath for verry many Re-
$pirations, without the lea$t ob$truction from the Water: And be-
cau$e this Machine will $tay with its upper end level with the Wa-
ters $urface (the affixed Lead having been $o limited) therefore
de$iring to de$cend to the bottom, the Diver $hould hale the Ball
and Line upwards, which was $ent before to the Bottom, in haling
of which the $aid Machine will de$cend as much under Water as he
hales the Corde; and if he continue haling it, till there be none of
it left, he $hall de$cend to the Bottome; and in the de$cent, and after
that he $hall be got to the bottom, he mu$t look round about him
through that tran$parent Globe for to finde out the thing he $eeks,
and $eeing it, he may many wayes with ca$e transferre him$elf
thither without ri$ing again to the top; And when he would re-
turn upwards to the toppe of the Water, he needs do no more but
$lacken that corde fa$tned to the Ball of Lead, for thereupon the
Machine $hall begin to ri$e upwards, and letting the $aid Corde goe,
it $hall not $tay till the Machines upper parte arrive at the $urface of
the Water; and being a$cended thither, the Diver may come out
thereof, and $wim to the top, and provide him$elf afterwards of
$uch things as are nece$$ary for embreching the $aid Ship or other
matter $unke: And in ca$e the Diver cannot $wim, it will be nece$$a-
ry to fa$ten a Corde to the Ring placed in the Centre of the upper
Board, and thereby to draw the Modell above the Surface of the
<foot>S$$ 3 Water;</foot>
<p n=>504</p>
Water; but knowing how to $wim, he may enter, a$cend, and
de$cend of him$elf, without any help.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> III.</head>
<P>But if you chance to be in a place where you cannot procure
the $aid Globe to be made of Gla$$e, it may be made of Wood;
but then you mu$t make therein great Sights, or Eyeholes of
clear Gla$$e of each $ide to look four $everall wayes; and pay it
without, and al$o within if you $ee cau$e with Pitch. And if you
cannot get $uch a Ball of Wood, you may make $hift with a little
Cubicall Che$t or Boxe, like one of tho$e Che$ts wherein they plant
Ceaders, which mu$t be well joyned graved and pitch't, with four
$uch Sights of Gla$$e as before, namely one upon every lateral flat
or plain, $o placed, that the Diver may $ee through them every way,
and be able to look downwards, it would be good to make the
Box $omewhat narrower towards the mouth, that $o the four late-
rall Planes may look $omewhat $loping: and in the entrance, de-
$cent, a$cent, and coming forth, you are to u$e the $ame Rules as be-
fore; aud if you have a de$ire to de$cend fa$ter, you mu$t make the
Ball of Lead $omewhat heavier, that was tyed to the end of the
Corde, and this done the Machine $hall de$cend fa$ter to the bottom
upon halling the $aid Corde and Ball; and when you vere or let
loo$e the Cord, the Engine will re-a$cend but according to its former
$peed: But if you would al$o make it $wifter in its a$cent you are
to proceed quite contrary, that is, you mu$t $omewhat dimini$h the
Lead, which is under the Ba$e of the fiame; and the more you di-
mini$h the $aid Lead, the $wifter $hall it be in a$cending. But you
mu$t remember withall to encrea$e the Ball of Lead, $o that it may
be able to draw the $aid Machine to the bottome $peedily or lei$ure-
ly according as occa$ion requires.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> IV.</head>
<P>But if there be any likelihood of any obnoxious Fi$h in the place
where the Diver is to de$cend, that may hurt him, being quite na-
ked; though that in the former kind of Machine with four pillars you
may $e u e him with a wire Grate, made in the manner of doors to the
$ame, yet to the end that you may know that this Invention may be
varied $undry ways; you may in this ca$e have a Globe of tran$parent
gla$s made at <I>Murano,</I> of $uch a bigne$s, that a man $tanding on his feet,
or el$e $itting, may be contain'd therein, having amouth or round hole
of capacity $ufficient for a man, commodiou$ly to enter and goe out
thereby, and $omewhat larger: &amp; then coffin or enclo$e the $aid Globe
<foot>between</foot>
<p n=>505</p>
between two round Boards of $omewhat a greater Diameter than
the Globe, with four pillars, as in the en$uing figure doth graphically
appear. But in the round Board which is put over the hole or mouth
of the $aid Globe, you mu$t al$o make a round hole $omewhat nar-
rower than that of the Globe, but yet big enough for a man to pa$$e
in and out thereat. Afterwards under this round Board $o bored,
you mu$t place and fix another round bored piece of Lead of $uch
thickne$$e, as that it may be able to draw the $aid Ball or Globe of
Gla$$e, together with the Diver in $uch manner under Water, that
the upper round Board do re$t in the Surface of the Water, namely,
that it may not be $o heavy as to $ink the Globe and Diver to the
bottome, but only to retain it beneath the Surface of the Water,
which by tryal may be ea$ily proportioned, namely, by adding or
taking away Lead from the Ba$e, according as occa$ion $hall require.
Next you are to frame a $eat for the Diver to $it commodiou$ly in
the $aid Ball or Globe, and next fa$ten a Ball of Lead to the end of
a Rope, as many fathom long as the water is deep into which you
would de$cend, and $omewhat more, as was $aid in the preceding
Explanation. And that Ball of Lead $hould be of $uch bigne$$e, that
applied to the $aid Model, it may be $ufficient to make it de$cend to
the bottome lei$urely, or $wiftly, as he $eeth cau$e who is to dive.
And make an handle or peg in the $aid Globe whereat to fa$ten or
belay the other end of
the $aid Rope, and to
draw it ea$ily upwards,
<fig>
or let it loo$e at the
plea$ure of him that is
within, and this may be
ea$ily done by joyning
and fa$tening four
pieces of wood upright
in the mouth or hole of
that bored Board and
Lead, which $hall be
about the mouth of the
$aid Globe; and that
I may be the better
under$tood, I will give
it you in figure with the
Diver $itting therein.
If you would de$cend to the bottome of $ome deep water by help
of this Machine, you are to proceed according to the directions gi-
ven in the precedent Explanation.</P>
<foot><I>EXPLA-</I></foot>
<p n=>506</p>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> V.</head>
<P>In ca$e you $hould be in a place where you could not have $uch
a Globe made of Gla$$e, you may procure one of Copper or
<marg>* <I>Brenta,</I> a Ve$$el
in which they
in Italy carry
Grapes to the
Pre$s.</marg>
Lead, round in fa$hion of a greater ^{*} Churne, wide in the bot-
tome and narrow in the mouth, and at lea$t five foot high, and four
foot broad. It may indeed be made quadrangular, that is, $o that
the mouth be at lea$t three foot $quare every way, and the bottome
at lea$t four foot every $ide, and not under five foot high, and this
$ame ve$$el, making it of Lead, mu$t be $o contrived, or proportio-
ned, that the corporeal or $olid <I>Area,</I> or Content of its interiour va-
cuity, or $pace, be about <*> or uple to the $olid <I>Area</I> of the Lead,
which is imployed in making the $aid Ve$$el; that is, make the Lead
of $uch a thickne$$e, that the Ve$$els vacuity may be nine tenths of
the $olid Area of all the whole Frame, which may be ea$ily done by
any one that is not ignorant of practical Geometry: and this Ve$$el
being made, you $hould place or $et therein four great Fye holes or
Sights of tran$parent or cri$taline Gla$$e, $o placed as to $ee any way
as you $hall need or de$ire: and furthermore, in the framing of this
$ame Ve$$el, you mu$t make $ome provi$ion for the $etling or $tay-
ing your feet, and to $it down, and likewi$e you mu$t make a
Pulley to hall the Ball of Lead up, or let it down, which is fa$tened
to the end of the long cord, as was $aid in the two precedent ca$es.
And moreover, in the making of this Ve$$el, you are to fa$ten four
Rings of Iron to the bottome without, namely, to the four Angles,
it being Quadrangular; (and being round, let them divide the Cir-
cumference into four equal parts) and betwixt the$e four Rings,
you mu$t place a $quare or round Deal Board. And this Ve$$el thus
modellized $hall be $o contrived, that putting it into the water with
the mouth downwards, with him in it who is to Dive, it $hall but ju$t
$tay in the Surface of the water with that bottome of wood; but if
it chance that it $hall not $tay at the Surface of the water by helpof
that bottome of Board, but that it will de$cend, you mu$t upon that
bottome fa$ten another, or two, or more $quare or round Boards to
the four Rings, in $uch wi$e, that by means of the $aid Boaids it may
be reduced to $uch a quality, that it may re$t with the $aid round
Boards in the Surface of the water, and de$cend no farther. Having
with judgement and experience provided all the$e things, and the
Diver being de$irous to de$cend of him$elf, and likewi$e to return
to the top when he plea$eth, this may be performed with that Ball
of Lead tied to the end of that long Rope, as hath been $aid in the
precedent Explanations, that is, to $end the Ball fir$t to the bottom in
he place where the Diver would de$cend, and then to enter into the
<foot>Machine,</foot>
<p n=>507</p>
Machine, and to $ettle him$elf therein; and then to pull the Ball
upwards, which $hould be of that Gravity, that it may be apt to
make $uch a Ve$$el or Machine de$cend together with the Diver; and
if the Machine chance to be ju$tly contrived, as hath been $aid a-
bove, I hold that a Ball of $ive or $ix pounds may be $ufficient to
make it de$cend nimbly upon the pulling of the Cord, and lifting
the Ball from the bottome, and continuing to draw the $aid Cord,
as long as there is any remaining, he $hall arrive at the bottome; and
whenever he would return upwards, he need but only vere or $lack-
en that Cord, and letting it all go he will not cea$e a$cending till the
Machine attains with its top (covered with tho$e $quare or round
Boards) unto the Surface of the Water, as hath been $aid of the o-
thers. I will not $tand to $hew you the many particularities which
might be in$erted for the tran$porting your $elves from one pl<*>ce to
another, keeping at the bottome, that is, without returning to the
top, for that they are almo$t infinite, but it $hall $uffice to let you
know, that he may ea$ily do it, carrying with him a long Hitcher, or
a Boom, or a Spike with a Hook at the end.</P>
<P>Many other particulars there might be in$i$ted on, and e$pecially
how many may $imply (that is, without any of the for<*>d Ma-
chines) go to the bottome, and $tay for many hours under Water,
which, be$ides the many profitable conclu$ions that might from
thence be inferred for Diving in indifferent depths, being accompa-
nied with the helps pre$cribed in the foregoing Explanations, they
would be much to the purpo$e, for that the Liver being once condu-
cted with the Machine near unto the thing $unk, he might come out
of the $aid Machine, and go and $tay for a long time about the $ame,
to fa$ten, or prepare tho$e things that are nece$$ary for the rai$ing
it: And farthermore, there is $omething to be $aid, when the thing
$unk is in a muddy or dark Water, how the Diver may in $undry
wayes, kindle there a great and flaming light, which flaming fire,
be$ides that it would make him di$cern the thing $unk, it would al$o
$ecure him in his going forth of the Machine from any devouring
Fi$hes, for that all $uch as $hould chance to be near that place would
be affrighted at $uch an unu$ual $pectacle, and would make far
from it. I might al$o $hew many wayes to embreech and grapple a
Ship when it is found, as well in deep as $hallow Channels, which
particulars I $hall re$erve for another time.</P>
<P>I will not $tand to $hew how this kind of Diving Machine might
be made of Boards, and that in $undry fa$hions, well calked and
pitcht, with four Lights or Sights, fa$tening about the mouth of the
$ame as much Lead as $hould be nece$$ary, ora$inuch as by what
hath been $poken in the third Explanation, it is $ufficiently manife$t.

<head>PRINCE
France$co Donato,
Duke of

<P><I>Having not long $ince, Most Serene, and Mo$t
Illu$trious Prince, publi$hed under the Glorious
Name of your Highne$$e, $undry and diver$e
way storai$e a Ship $unk, with its Cargo in it (when once</I>
<foot><I>it</I></foot>
<p n=>509</p>
<I>it is Grappled) I mu$t confe$$e I was not then $ollicitous to
find a way to imbreach or grapple the $aid Ship (though
it is nece$$ary to be known) and the cau$e thereof was, for
that I concluded that among$t Mariners there were a
thou$and means to effect it, and I was loath to enquire af-
ter $uch things as are commonly known to many, although
I be ignorant of them; but delight to $earch into tho$e
things which none el$e can do. Now, having been $ince
told and a$$ured by many, that Mariners, and all other
per$ons of ingenuity find far greater difficulty in imbrea-
ching and Grappling $uch a Ship, than they do, (when
once they have hold of it) to rai$e the $ame: I under$tan-

$hould be general and $ecure, and to adde it in the end of

which to me hath $eemed mo$t univer$al and ea$y to be

$elf</I></P>
<P>NICOLO TARTAGLIA.</P>
<p n=>510</p>
<head>A Supplement.</head>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> I.</head>
<P>To hitch therefore, and $ling, or grapple fa$t a laden Ship
that is $unk, being in a $howle bottome, as was that broken
up near to <I>Malamoccho,</I> you are to take a very $trong
Sheat-anchor Cable, of $uch a length as is $ufficient for
the U$es hereafter to be under$tood, and at one end of
$uch a Cable you are to $eiz or fa$ten very well a thick and $trong Iron
Ring, big enough for the other end of the Cable to pa$$e through with
ea$e, and make thereof a running Parbunckle: and then, near to this
Ring (that is under this Cable at the place where it $hall be bent to
the Ring) you mu$t $eiz or fa$ten one of the Flooks of a thick and
$trong Anchor, and about three fathoms $pace from that fir$t An-
chor hitch the Flook of another $econd Anchor into the $aid Cable,
$eizing or fa$tening it that it $tir not: and about two fathoms di-
$tance from this $econd Anchor, $eiz, as before the Flook of a third
Anchor, and $o two fathom from that a fourth Anchor; and $o pro-
ceed, placing in that manner as many Anchors as $uffice to go round
the Hull of the $aid Ship under its Wails, and rather le$$e than more,
to the end the la$t Anchor may be no hinderance to the running of
the Parbunckle at the Ring at $uch time as it is to be rou$ed or vered,
that is, to be drawn or let $lip. The truth is, that in the part of the
Cable marked E, in the Figure following, and in the oppo$ite
part marked G (which parts you are to place $o that they may fall
one at the Stem, the other at the Stern) no Anchor is to be placed,
but you mu$t leave at lea$t three fathom interval betwixt tho$e An-
chors at G, as was required to be done betwixt the fir$t and $econd
at E. And then form the $aid Running Parbunckle, that is, reeve the
other end of the Cable through the Ring of Iron; and, that being
made, you are to place many per$ons upon Flat-bottome Boats fa-
$tened in an Oval Figure round the place where the Ship lyeth: and
then vere or $lacken the Parbunckle, but in an Oval Form, to that
widene$$e, that it may at four or five foot di$tance, inviron the foun-
dered Ship: and this done, you mu$t let all the Anchors, together
with this Girdle or Parbunckle, (being kept at that widene$$e) gent-
ly and equally fall to the bottome of the Sea, keeping the Ship in
the mid$t of the Ovall: and when you perceive all the Anchors de-
$cended to the bottome, you mu$t vere there $everal Cables, that
they may $ink deep into the $and or Ouze; and then after this you
<foot>mu$t</foot>
<p n=>511</p>
mu$t draw, and bring them by degrees clo$e underneath the Hull of
the Ve$$el, and then hall or $train hard the end of the Sheat Anchor
Cable which was reeved through the Ring; and begirt the Hull
of the Ship therewith, as with a Girdle (and to $train it very taught, it
would not be ami$$e to make u$e of a Cap$tan) and when this
Girdle is drawn to its due exactne$$e, to the end it may not $lip (in
the elevation of the Ship) fa$ten to that part which you hold above
Water another Ring of Iron, and pa$$e through this Ring one of
the Anchor-Cables that is on the $ame $ide as the fir$t Ring is on,
and almo$t as far from the $aid Ring, as the $econd Ring is di$tant
from the fir$t; whereupon making this $econd Ring to $lip along
the $aid Anchor Cable, and then in the Elevation halling the $ame,
it $hall make the $aid Girdle taught under the $aid Ship: and that I
may be the better under$tood, I have here underneath repre$ented
the $aid Girdle pul'd together in an Oval Figure as it is to lye under
the Rake of the Ships Hull with fourteen Flooks of fourteen An-
chors under the $ame (except in the part inked E, and in its oppo-
$ite part G,) well $ea$-
ed; of which Girdle, or
Parbunckle, the fir$t
<fig>
Ring $hall be A,
through which the
Sheat-Anchor Cable
pa$$eth, namely, the
Cable A B, to which
Cable was fa$tened a
$econd Ring in the
point B, through which
$econd Ring, (to the
end the Girdle might
not $lio) we will reeve
the Cable of the An-
chor C; which Anchor
C we $uppo$e to be
$omewhat farther from
the Ring A, than the $econd Ring B is from the fir$t Ring A, and
then make the $aid Ring B to $lip along the Cable of the $aid <I>A</I>nchot
C, till it come to the point C. <I>A</I>nd thus the Ship $hall be $ecurely
and $trongly grappled and begirt. <I>W</I>hich done, proceeding as we
directed in the fir$t Book of our <I>Indn$trious Invention,</I> you will exe-
cute your purpo$e; That is, when the two or more coupled Ships
$hall be full of water, at the ebbing of the Tide you are to fa$ten
and belay to tho$e Tires of Beams that couple the $aid Ships, all
tho$e fourteen Cables, taking a little more care in tying, and belay-
<foot>Ttt 3 ing</foot>
<p n=>512</p>
ing that of the Anchor C, which will keep the Girdle from $lipping
in the Elevation.</P>
<P>But if you doubt that that $ingle Cable, to which the Anchors
are fa$tened, is not $ufficient for $o great a weight, you may above
that, place another with a Ring al$o, through which (as before) the
end of it may pa$$e, by that means begirting the Ship with two of
tho$e Girdles, and ob$erving the $ame Rules you may take three or
four of tho$e $lipping $heat- anchor Cables, each with its Ring
wherein to run in the manner of a Noo$e. <I>A</I>nd when the $aid new
Girdle is pulled $trait and clo$e to the Ship, fa$ten to the $aid Cable,
(or to each of them if you u$e more) another $econd Ring, to gird
and hold the $aid Noo$e fa$t, that it $lip not with the Cable of the
<I>A</I>nchor C, or with more of tho$e <I>A</I>nchor-Cables if there be occa-
$ion.</P>
<P><I>A</I>nd in ca$e that tho$e fourteen Cables be thought in$ufficient
to bear $o great a burden, you may take twenty or thirty of them, or
as many as you plea$e, tying them clo$er to one the other, under
the running Cable, and make half of them to be placed on one $ide,
and the other half on the other $ide of the $aid Ship.</P>
<P><I>A</I>nd if again it be doubted that the $ingle Cable of the <I>A</I>nchor
C s not able to hold the Noo$e fa$t, you may take two or three of
them, for you may judge what the $tre$s of that anchor is by means of
the height of the water. Truth is, this office might be di$tributed
among$t more <I>A</I>nchors, by adding a third Ring to the main Cable,
as far from the $econd, as the <I>A</I>nchor D is di$tant from the <I>A</I>nchor
C, $o that the Cable of the <I>A</I>nchor D, pa$$ing through that third
Ring, and $lipping the $aid Ring along till it come to D, it will fol-
low that tho$e two Cables of tho$e two Anchors C and D, will keep
the Parbunckle $traight; aud in this manner you may proceed by ad-
ding new Rings, and imploying more Anchor-Cables, for the great-
er $ecurity.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> II.</head>
<P>The $ame method may al$o be ob$erved when the Ship is in a
deep place, provided that the depth exceed not the length of the
Hull of the Ship, becau$e then there may be alwaies found $ome one
or more Cables $ufficient to reeve through the $econd and follow-
ing Rings of the Main Cable to $ecure the Noo$e from $lipping, or
growing $lack, as in the preceding declaration hath been $aid. But if
it chance that the depth of the place be far greater than the length
of the Ship, you can no longer $ecure the Noo$e with that $econd
Ring, but mu$t find out $ome other way, and though there might be
many found out, I $hall in$tance but in this one.</P>
<foot>After</foot>
<p n=>513</p>
<P>After you have $trained, drawn the $aid Girdle as taught as you
can, you may take the Cable thereof, and the Cable of the anchor
next adjoyning on the $ame $ide that the fir$t Ring is on (namely,
the Cable marked F,) and twi$t and wind them together, and then
reeve the $ingle Cable of the Girdle <I>A B,</I> through the Ring of a
Sheat-anchor, (without its Cable) and let the anchor $lide down-
wards along the $aid Main Cable, which by rea$on of its weight will
run almo$t clo$e to the Ring <I>A,</I> of the Main Cable, pre$$ing the twi$t
of the two Cables clo$e at <I>A</I>; and this done, once more twine or
twi$t a little the two former Cables, namely the Sheat anchor-cable
B, and the le$$er Cable F, and then $ea$e tho$e two Cables $everally
to the Orders of Beams, that is, one to one Order, and the other to
another at $ome di$tance from the former, to the end they drive
down the twi$ting near to the Ring of the anchor: which twi$ting
will keep the Noo$e from $lipping or opening in elevating the Ship.
<I>A</I>nd if there be any occa$ion to u$e a Cap$tain (as was $aid in the
$eventh Explanation of the fir$t Book) you mu$t always take care
to $train the$e two Cables equally, and much a$under, which doing,
the Girdle $hall be kept $trait. Many other ways might be $hewen
for to keep the $aid Grand Cable from $lipping, but e$teeming them
$uperfluous, I omit them.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> III.</head>
<P>He that is de$irous to recover a foundered Ship laden with
Fraight, by other ways than tho$e pre$cribed in the fir$t Book,
namely, without $tanding to fill tho$e two or more Ships, or other
Ve$$els with water, and then to empty them, may only by force of
Cap$tains or Cranes ea$ily effect the $ame in the manner following,
($till making u$e of the Parbunckle and flooks of anchors explained
in the fir$t Explanation of this) namely: By taking from their an-
chors Rings all their Cables, except that which is to make fa$t the
Main-Cable Noo$e that begirts the Ship, and in their places make
fa$t to each Ring a $trong Pulley or Block, in $uch $ort, that all the
$aid Pulleys or Blocks have equal number of Shivers, or wheels, and
tho$e as many as you can make them: and through the$e Shivers or
wheels reeve their proper and convenient Cables or Ropes, incatena-
ting each Pulley with its $uperiour; and this done, make two $qua-
drons of Barks, or Lighters, or Flat-boats, according to the method
laid down in the fourth Explanation of the fir$t Book, collated and
bound together with tho$e Tires of thick and $trong Beams tripled,
and with a great and $pacious platform of thick Planks upon each
$quadron, and upon tho$e two $pacious platforms place as many
Cap$ters or Ship-cranes as you $hall judge nece$$ary for $uch a
<foot>weight,</foot>
<p n=>514</p>
weight, and rather much more, then ever $o little le$s, and then let
fall the $aid Anchors lei$urely, with the Girdle opened in an Oval
Figure, untill they come to the bottome of the Sea, $o that the Girdle
do encircle or $urround the foundered Ship. And having once be-
girt it carefully, approximate all the Anchors with the Girdle to the
Hull of the Ship, and then $harpen or make taught the Girdle-cable
by halling it hard and $treight to the Ships hull, and when it is
drawn clo$e, belay it that it may not $lacken, with that $ingle An-
chor-cable, or more, according to that $ecure way $poken of but
now, or by $ome other than $hall $eem more expedient, (for many
more, if one think thereon may be found:) and this being done,
$eek to loo$en the Ship by degrees from its bed of Ouze, a little on
one $ide, and a little on the other with the afore$aid Cap$ters, and,
being once water born, then draw it upwards equally on both $ides,
and proceed in this manner till $uch time as you have hoi$ted it $uf-
ficiently above the Waters $urface, and then pump out the Water,
and unlade its Cargo.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> IV.</head>
<P>Having in the $econd Book $hewn $everal ways of Diving under
Water in $earch of things $unk, in this place I have thought
fit to add, in ca$e that $ome little thing of value $hould fall
into a Water in $ome $hady place, and where its bottome is ob$cure
and dark, a way how to conveigh a Light thither that may give light
enough for the di$cerning of that little thing, provided that it be not
buried in, or covered with the old Ouze. Now to perform this, and
that with expedition, we may in $mall depths take one of tho$e bra$s
Buckets or Pails, which are u$ed in carrying and keeping of Water
for hou$ehold u$es: and tho$e of them that are $haped long and
deep, with feet $hall be better then tho$e that are made round and
$hallow, without feet; and the bigger and higher it is, $o much the
better it $hall be. And having made choice of $uch a Bucket, you
are to fa$ten to the Ears of it two $mall Ropes of about two yardes
apiece, in $uch a fa$hion, as that they may one cro$s the other at the
mouth of the Bucket, making upon it a perfect cro$s, and that the
Knot of the Ropes may be in the mid$t of the Buckets bottom with-
out, making of the ropes a Hoop over the bottome whereat to fa$ten
another Rope of greater length; $o that the Bucket being held by
that la$t Rope may come to hang with its mouth perpendicularly
downwards. And this done, fa$ten as much Lead to the two Eares of
the Bucket as may ju$t make it $ink to the Bottome, and then $et
and fa$ten a little Wax candle lighted in the inter$ection that tho$e
two Ropes make over the mouth of the Bucket, that is, in the centre
<foot>of</foot>
<p n=>515</p>
of that perfect cro$s; $o that the candle with its light may be with-
in, and near the bottome of the $aid Bucket. This being done, let
down the Bucket, with the candle in it gently unto the bottome,
which doing, you $hall $ee the burning candle clearly enlighten the
bottome of the Water. And this Bucket you may remove from
place to place, without drawing it upwards. The truth is, that this
candle will not long continue burning, but will $erve for a little
while, and when it $hall go out of it $elf, it may be drawn up, re-
lighted, and let down, as occa$ion requires: but the greater that the
Bucket, and the le$$er that the candle $hall be, $o much the longer
time $hall it keep its light under Water: and therefore if the $aid
bottome were very deep, it would be requi$ite to perform that e$$ect
with $o much a greater Ve$$el, as a great Caldron, but yet of Brals,
or by that means the candle $hall continue longer lighted.</P>
<head><I>EXPLANATION</I> V.</head>
<P>But in ca$e that a Ship or Bark were foundered in $ome $pacious
and profound Gulph, and that the exact place where it $unk
were unknown, and that the bottome of the $aid $pacious Gulph
were very ob$cure, it is manife$t that $o little a light as that $poke
of in the precedent Explanation would hardly $erve. And therefore
if you would convey thither one much bigger, you may do it $eve-
rall wayes, of which one is this. Take nine ounces of refined Salt-
peter, $ix ounces (Greek weight) of Brim$tone that is clear and
tran$parent, three ounces of Camphire refined, and one ounce of
Ma$tick; and beat all the$e things $everally, not very $mall; and
when you have beaten them, mix them all together in an Earthen
Pan; and when they are well mingled, put thereto three pounds of
common Gunpowder, and then remingle them very well together;
and afterwards put therein four ounces of oyl of Stone, and mix all
very well; and this done, take a Cartredge thereof, and give fire to
it; and if it burn too $lowly, put a little more Gunpowder to it,
but if it burn too vehemently and $uddenly, add thereto more oyl.
Put this Compo$ition, after this, into a little Bag of double Canvis,
of $uch a widene$$e, that when all the mixture is out, therein it may
be as broad, as high, and cram the Compo$ition hard down into the
Bag; and then with very good Pack thread $ew up the mouth of the
Sack, cutting away the $uperfluous Canvas. Then winde a good
hempen cord round about it very hard every way, reducing it to the
form of a round Ball, and after it is very well bound and $wathed a-
bout many $everall times, you mu$t melt Brim$tone into a great Ve$-
$el, and when it is melted, roll the $aid Ball therein $o, as that it may
be covered all over with a cru$t of Brim$tone. And this being done
<foot>Vvv affix</foot>
<p n=>516</p>
affix a piece of Lead unto the Ball by an iron Wire, and make it ve-
ry fa$t, and frame in the top of the Ball a Bow or Noo$e with the
$aid Wire, and to that fa$ten a long Rope, and then in the oppo$ite
place where the Lead is fixed, make an hole with an iron rod into
the middle of the Ball, and $top that hole with a little fine Gunpow-
der, holding it $u$pended by the Rope: and when you would have
that Light de$cend into the bottome of the Sea or Gulph, goe to the
place, and give fire to the little hole, and when it is inkindled, let
down the Ball and Lead, lengthwayes, almo$t to the bottome, where
he $hall be that would find the thing $unk, and you $hall find that
the $aid fire will illuminate very much round about the $aid bottom,
and $hall la$t a long time, and more or le$s, according to the hole
made in the Ball. 'Tis to be noted, that the Ball is to be held over
the head of him that diveth, for that the $moke proceeding from it
will much ob$cure the Waters above it, $o as that it will give Light
only downwards; and this fire will be a dreadful $ight unto the Fi$h,
$o that they will fly from $o new a $pectacle.</P>
